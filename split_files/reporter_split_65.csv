 Osteoarthritis (OA), the loss of cartilage lining articular joints, is the leading cause of pain and disability
worldwide. There are no existing treatments for OA and pain management strategies are inadequate. OA was
historically dismissed as a consequence of mechanical overloading, but overloading does not explain the
burden of OA. Furthermore, approaches to study this painful disease have often focused on evaluating single
tissues in isolation, like cartilage, and assume that OA pathology is focused solely within the joint organ
system. However, the OA population disproportionally is comprised of individuals with obesity and other co-
morbidities. We and others have contributed to a paradigm shift in OA, demonstrating the surprising finding
that OA may have systemic origins involving adipose tissue.. To determine the individual mechanistic
influences of systemic adipose tissue on the joint, we developed a model of fat free mice, that completely lack
fat, but are protected from OA. We can reverse this protection by implanting a small fat graft, which illustrates a
line of communication between fat and cartilage that is separable from other factors like insulin resistance and
liver damage, which are incompletely rescued. Consistent with this hypothesis, we are changing the prevalent
view in OA and propose that OA is a whole-body disease of pain and loss of physical function. Here we aim to
define systemic mediators of OA, which may enable the generation of first-in-class disease modifying
treatments that would chart the course for improved whole-body health and longevity.
 By studying OA, this proposal will provide insight into a critical unanswered question in multi-
organ aging: Is OA a systemic disease that generates symptoms in the joint? Our objective is to
determine how adipose tissue communicates with the joint. We will interrogate three potential direct interorgan
crosstalk mechanisms using a comprehensive and ambitious approach: (1) signaling through soluble secreted
factors, (2) cell migration or cell-to-cell mediated, and (3) nervous system mediated adipose-joint crosstalk. Our
previous work suggests that all three mechanisms occur in OA, however their relative contribution and
hierarchy are unknown. In the first study, we will use leptin signaling, a factor widely implicated in OA
pathogenesis, to understand joint tissue-specific responses and signal transduction between fat and the knee
joint. Then, we will use heterochronic parabiosis as a model to understand cell migration to knee joint injury.
Finally, we will consider crosstalk between adipose and joint tissues through sensory neurons that innervate
the knee joint. Mouse models of OA typically focus on structural assessments using histology or imaging alone,
however our lab incorporates pain and structural damage assessments in all our OA models. Our lab is
uniquely positioned to interrogate these adipose-knee joint crosstalk mechanisms, as we have the tools
and expertise to dissect and test each. From these studies, we will delineate pathological mechanisms of OA to
develop much needed first-in-class therapeutic targets."
10909788,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is a complex autoimmune disease without a cure or an effective
therapy for the many devastating aspects of disease. Mouse models do not recapitulate all features of SSc,
mandating human studies for understanding this complex pathogenesis. The median survival is ~11 years after
SSc diagnosis and the estimated national hospital costs related to SSc exceed 275 million yearly. SSc affects 250
per 1 million people in the US, with a ~3-4 time greater prevalence among Veteran’s Health Administration
patients. The pathogenesis of SSc is characterized by immunological abnormalities, vascular changes, notably in
the microvasculature, and fibrosis, yet both the cause and effect of these mechanisms within the gastrointestinal
tract (GIT), which is the most common extra-cutaneous organ system damaged in SSc, is unknown.
 Our previous work supported by I01 CX002111-01 “Systemic sclerosis (SSc) vasculopathy: Improved
clinical monitoring and treatment” discovered that that both large artery (i.e., brachial artery), as well as
microvascular (i.e., arterioles and capillaries) endothelial dysfunction is a critical feature of SSc. A dysfunctional
endothelium leads to increased vascular permeability, greater tissue immune cell infiltration, blunted angiogenic
capacity and impaired vascular reactivity and tissue blood flow. While we showed that acutely we could improve
this vascular dysfunction, clinical interventions are limited by trial design issues and are greatly improved by
models that specifically study the mechanism of disease. We identified a novel method for quantifying
microvascular change in the oral cavity (sublingual videomicroscopy) that correlates to GIT symptoms in SSc.
This sublingual videomicroscope measures the glycocalyx, which maintains homeostasis of the vasculature,
including controlling vascular permeability and microvascular tone, preventing microvascular thrombosis, and
regulating leukocyte adhesion.
 In the first specific aim of our proposed study, we will perform a natural history study of the glycocalyx,
its relation to GIT patient reported outcomes (PRO) and end-stage vasculopathy features, including digital ulcers
(DU), pulmonary hypertension (PH), scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), calcinosis, and telangiectases. In the second
specific aim of the proposed study, we will develop a novel model to further study these end-stage vasculopathy
features (DU, PH, SRC, calcinosis, telangiectases, and severe GIT symptoms) in Veterans with SSc. We will
generate endothelial cells (EC) from inducible pluripotential stem cells (iPSC) created from their blood and age-
frequency and sex matched healthy controls. The main research objective of this project is to build upon our
current clinical research program for our Veterans with SSc that has identified important in vivo aspects of SSc
vasculopathy and its relation to PRO. The over-arching goal of this project renewal is to define SSc-GIT
vasculopathy through serial microvascular measurements in the vasculature of the mouth and correlate these to
symptoms, end-stage vasculopathy clinical features, and glycocalyx characterization. We will then investigate the
etiology of end-stage vascular complications through the establishment of a SSc-iPSC-EC model that can be
tested for permeability, healing, and leukocyte rolling. Thus, this proposal will clarify SSc vasculopathy
pathogenesis through serial sublingual microvascular microscopy, GIT PRO, markers of glycocalyx dysfunction,
and testing of SSc-iPSC-EC generated from peripheral blood. This vasculopathy characterization can potentially
allow us to identify targeted clinical assessments, develop effective management plans, and apply therapeutic
screens for this devastating disease that effects our Veterans quality of life, and for which we currently have a
very limited understanding of pathogenesis. Importantly, the novel iPSC model developed in this project has the
potential to be used in other rare diseases characterized by vascular dysfunction that effect our Veterans."
10910071,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Over the past two decades, suicide rates have increased nearly 35% in the U.S., with up-
ward trends in nearly all demographic groups. Further increases have occurred since the
COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite ambitious goals for reducing suicides and significant fed-
eral and private investment, suicide rates continue to rise unabated. To date, the predominant
approach to mitigating suicide risk in the U.S. is secondary prevention. Typically, these pro-
grams identify risk of recurrence among those who have already attempted suicide at least
once. Although secondary prevention is crucial, the majority of deaths by suicide occur on first
attempt. Thus, targeted primary prevention earlier in development is essential. Most current pri-
mary prevention programs are intensive, expensive, and delivered by highly trained mental
health providers, who are in short supply. Traditional face-to-face therapy is also unavailable to
many who live in underserved communities, and disliked by adolescents, who much prefer digi-
tal delivery on their devices. This high-risk, high-reward proposal addresses these limitations
and needs. We use an experimental therapeutics approach to evaluate the independent and
combined efficacies of two unconventional but scalable interventions: transcutaneous vagus
nerve stimulation (tVNS) to target emotion dysregulation, and a peer-support smartphone app to
combat social isolation. These low-cost interventions, which hold strong promise but have not
been used before, can reach large numbers of adolescents, with much potential to reduce pro-
spective suicide risk. We will enroll 212 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, who show elevations on
at least two prominent risk factors for suicide (e.g., self-injury, maltreatment). Using a 2 × 2 de-
sign, adolescents will be assigned randomly to receive 30 days of treatment with (1) tVNS to tar-
get emotion dysregulation, (2) a peer-support phone app to target social isolation, (3) tVNS + a
peer-support phone app, or (4) enhanced treatment as usual with monitoring and access to re-
sources. Intervention effects on mechanisms (emotion dysregulation, social isolation) proximal
efficacy signals (e.g., physiological reactivity, self-harm) and target outcomes (suicidal ideation,
suicidal behaviors) will be evaluated immediately post-intervention and at one-year follow-up.
Treatment data will be monitored daily to fine-tune dosing of both interventions. This transforma-
tive and innovative proposal tests two novel, scalable preventive interventions designed to
“meet adolescents where they are"" by using digital technologies to address core mechanisms of
suicide risk."
10910072,"The Testicular Cancer Consortium (TECAC) is the only international collaborative group whose goal is to
understand the genetic susceptibility to testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). The incidence of TGCT is highest
among men of European ancestry, and the most common cancer affecting men aged 15-45. TECAC and its
members have conducted successful genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of TGCT; our latest analysis
has identified 22 novel susceptibility alleles bringing the total validated risk markers to 68, accounting for 43%
of heritability. Our studies have revealed the critical role of variation affecting essential pathways of male germ
cell development and maturation, sex determination, chromosomal segregation, and DNA maintenance in
TGCT susceptibility. We propose three complementary aims to deepen our discovery of inherited variation of
susceptibility to TGCT, results of which will refine our understanding of the biology of TGCT and male germ cell
development, provide insights into inherited variation predisposing to genomic instability, and improve our
ability to identify patients at highest risk of disease. In Aim 1, we will identify rare and common variants
(individual and gene burden) using whole exome (WES) approaches followed by independent validation. We
will conduct de novo WES on extant biosamples from 1000 and 1000 men with and without TGCT,
respectively, and assemble existing WES data from 2066 men with TGCT from TECAC members for
comparison to genomically matched (1:4) unaffected men from the Penn Medicine and UK Biobanks. To
address data heterogeneity, WES data from all sources will be called together using a common pipeline. Fifty
genes and 500 SNPs will be selected for validation in an independent set of extant biosamples from 5000 and
5000 men with and without TGCT, respectively, all with existing genome-wide genotyping. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), preceded by the largest GWAS study to date in
15,847 men with TGCT and 27,178 (230,610 with deCODE) men without TGCT. We will use a customized
version of FUSION to perform the TWAS, annotated with expression data derived from TGCT cell lines, fetal
and adult germ cells, GTEx, and single cell sequencing of germ cells. In Aim 3, after in silico assessment and
prioritization, 20 top loci/genes will be evaluated in TGCT in vitro models using siRNA and CRISPR to assess
over-expression and knockdown effects on morphology, proliferation, chromosomal abnormalities, and
cisplatin sensitivity. We will select candidate genes from our past genetic association efforts (11 preliminarily
prioritized) and from novel loci/genes found in our WES (Aim 1), GWAS and TWAS (Aim 2) efforts. Our
renewal builds upon our accomplishments and paves the way to identify novel susceptibility loci through three
highly cohesive aims. Our findings will lead to further ground-breaking insights into the biology and genetic
etiology of TGCT and will provide data needed to identify men at greatest need for surveillance, the optimal
way to decrease serious TGCT treatment-related morbidity."

The breakthrough technology of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genomic editing offers an entirely new
and powerful therapeutic potential for patients suffering from genetic diseases like Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Since joining the Wellstone Network in 2015, the UT Southwestern
Myoediting Core has served both as an essential coordinating hub for the Wellstone research
groups (Projects 1 & 2) at UT Southwestern and as a conduit for sharing expertise and resources
with the broader scientific community. Moving forward, our goals for this Shared Research
Resource Core are: (Aim #1) To continue to support Projects 1 and 2 of the UT Southwestern
Wellstone Center by providing the cutting-edge technologies of human iPSCs, CRISPR/Cas9
genomic editing, and cardiomyocyte differentiation. (Aim #2) To help advance the study of
muscular dystrophy worldwide by providing a DMD/BMD Biorepository of patient-derived DMD
iPSCs and their corresponding CRISPR/Cas9-corrected isolates along with information regarding
the clinical phenotype and genomic sequence of the donor patient. (Aim #3) To help other
investigators take full advantage of these resources by freely sharing our streamlined protocols
and providing training (either on site, or in silico) in best practices and approaches. These
resources are available to investigators from other Wellstone Centers as well as the general
scientific community at large."
10911070,"Project Summary/Abstract
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited X-linked disease caused by mutations in the gene
encoding dystrophin, a protein required for muscle fiber integrity. The dystrophin gene is one of the largest
human genes and consists of 79 exons. Although there are thousands of individual DMD mutations that have
been identified in humans, these mutations are concentrated in hot spot regions of the dystrophin gene. DMD
affects approximately 1 in 5,000 boys and is characterized by progressive severe muscle weakness and a
shortened lifespan. Despite intense efforts to find cures for DMD through a variety of approaches, including
myoblast transfer, viral delivery of dystrophin, and oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping, there remains no
cure for this disease. Our approach is to use CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing to permanently correct DMD by
skipping or reframing the mutant dystrophin exons in postnatal muscle tissue in vivo. We refer to this strategy
as Myoediting. This genome editing approach removes the genetic mutation responsible for the disease,
allowing for permanent correction of muscle structure and function. We deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 components
using an adeno-associated virus-9 (AAV9) delivery system which has been shown to provide robust
expression in skeletal muscle, heart and brain, the major tissues affected in DMD patients. To date, we have
successfully corrected the dystrophin gene mutation in several DMD animal models having mutations in key
hot spot regions of the dystrophin gene. In the previous funding period, we generated several other DMD
animals models covering the remaining human hot spot regions and propose to correct these mutations using
CRISPR/Cas genomic editing. Although we have made much progress using CRISPR/Cas genomic editing to
correct DMD, there remains more work to be done to translate this gene editing therapy to the clinic. The
efficiency of delivering the CRISPR/Cas9 components needs to be optimized and questions remain as to the
durability of dystrophin expression after correction. Furthermore, since muscle fibers have hundreds of nuclei,
we need to understand the occurrence of CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing at the individual nuclear level. The
long-term goal of this project remains to optimize and adapt CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to
postnatal muscle and ultimately to leverage this approach to correct DMD mutations in humans. This project
continues to represent a close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists sharing the common goal
of advancing a new therapeutic strategy to permanently cure DMD."
10911072,"Project Summary/Abstract for Project 2
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a recessive X-linked neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutations
in the dystrophin gene, which ultimately produces progressive muscle wasting and atrophy. Importantly, DMD
patients develop cardiac fibrosis and a decrease in cardiac function leading to advanced cardiomyopathy,
which is currently the major contributor to mortality in DMD patients. The mission of the UT Southwestern
Wellstone Center is to develop CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as a therapeutic modality for DMD patients;
however, issues related to DMD-associated cardiomyopathy will continue to persist. Project 1 proposes to use
genome editing to target the 12 “hot spots” within the dystrophin gene making a truncated dystrophin protein
and converting a DMD patient into a Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) patient. Thus, the overall goal of
Project 2 is to develop novel therapies to attenuate the morbidity and mortality associated with DMD-
associated cardiomyopathy. Significant strides have been made in treating non-DMD cardiomyopathy;
however, there are no definitive therapies to effectively induce long term reverse cardiac remodeling and
improve overall cardiac function within DMD patients. Our group has undertaken a cardiac MRI study
demonstrating that adult DMD patients have very low left ventricular (LV) mass as well as low LV concentricity
as compared to age-, sex-, and weight-matched control patients. Once a DMD patient develops symptoms
related to advanced cardiomyopathy, the DMD heart starts to dilate and enlarge resembling the structure of
advanced dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. These observations raise the question whether the
development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy is the primary mechanism underlying DMD-associated
cardiomyopathy. Does the observed low LV mass and concentricity arise due to prolonged immobility or are
independent of a DMD patient’s ability to ambulate? Data from the Mammen Laboratory indicates that mdx
mice, a murine model of DMD, have altered cardiac metabolism and also have low cardiac mass due to a
decrease in proliferative gene expression during the first week of life. Therefore, the central hypothesis of
Project 2 is that low LV mass and concentricity in DMD-associated cardiomyopathy leads to progressive
cardiomyopathy independent of a DMD patient’s ability to ambulate. To test our central hypothesis, we will
pursue the following three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Characterize the clinical and molecular phenotypes
in ambulatory and non-ambulatory DMD patients as a function of patient age. Specific Aim 2: Define the
cardiac phenotype in BMD-associated cardiomyopathy as a function of patient age and site of the genetic
mutation. Specific Aim 3: Determine the molecular phenotypes of human DMD and BMD cardiomyocytes."
10923781,"Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important public health concern for aging Veterans due to
the increased risk for progression to dementia and increased mortality. Insomnia is common in MCI (occurring
in up to 60% of patients) and increases risk for dementia, disability, and poor quality of life. Rates of MCI and
insomnia are higher among Veterans than civilians, thus aging Veterans with MCI and comorbid insomnia
represent a particularly high-risk population. The gold standard treatment for insomnia, Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), is a multi-component behavioral intervention. However, cognitive impairments
experienced by individuals with MCI may limit the rate of progress in CBT-I. The use of memory support
strategies can improve patient recall of therapeutic information, enhance treatment adherence, and improve
treatment outcomes. Cognitive Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy (CogSMART) provides
compensatory strategies to improve learning, memory, attention, and executive functioning. CogSMART has
been shown to improve cognition, functional capacity, neurobehavioral symptoms, and quality of life in diverse
Veteran populations with cognitive impairment. Incorporating supportive CogSMART cognitive strategies into
CBT-I has the potential to improve treatment learning, adherence, and outcomes for this Veteran population.
Significance: This RR&D SPiRE research project will assist us in developing and evaluating Sleep-SMART
(Sleep Symptom Management and Rehabilitation Therapy), an innovative user-informed approach for
treatment of insomnia in Veterans with MCI. Sleep-SMART is intended to provide the core components of
CBT-I along with training in compensatory cognitive strategies from CogSMART to enhance intervention
adherence and learning. Provision of this supportive cognitive training will assist Veterans with cognitive
impairments in maintaining compliance with the CBT-I regimen, thereby leading to faster and more complete
treatment benefits. Aims: Our principle aims for the investigation include: 1) developing the Sleep-SMART
intervention and treatment manual; 2) assessing the feasibility and acceptability of Sleep-SMART in Veterans
with MCI and insomnia; and 3) exploring the effects of Sleep-SMART on rehabilitation outcomes, quality of life,
sleep, and cognitive functioning. Methodology: We propose to develop the Sleep-SMART intervention and
manual over the first 6 months of the project (Phase I) using a participatory research approach guided by the
Intervention Mapping Adapt framework. We will subsequently assess the feasibility and acceptability of Sleep-
SMART (Phase II) by enrolling 26 Veterans ages 60 and older to receive six 50-minute weekly sessions of
individual Sleep-SMART treatment via secure video-conferencing. Feasibility will be assessed through
recruitment metrics, level of Veteran participation in the treatment, clinician fidelity to the treatment protocol,
and evaluation of barriers to treatment implementation. Acceptability will be assessed primarily through
questionnaires and other measures assessing satisfaction, acceptability, appropriateness, and adherence to
the intervention. While efficacy is not our primary aim, we will collect some initial data for estimating effect
sizes to assist in future power calculations. Veterans will be asked to complete specific measures of disability,
independent living skills, quality of life, sleep, and cognitive functioning. Next Steps: Pilot data acquired from
this investigation will be used for application(s) to conduct randomized controlled trials investigating the
efficacy of Sleep-SMART in Veterans with MCI and insomnia compared to standard CBT-I or treatment as
usual. The results of this investigation will also be used to inform scale-up implementation and dissemination
efforts."

The CNPRC has maintained a pedigreed colony of Indian-origin rhesus macaques for over 22 years. The SPF
Pedigreed Indian origin rhesus colony includes both an SPF level 1 colony negative for Simian Retrovirus
(SRV), Simian Immmunodeficiency Virus (SIV), Simian T Cell Lymphotrophic Virus (STLV) , and Herpes B virus
(B virus) and an SPF Level 2 colony free of three additional viruses including rhesus cytomegalovirus
(RhCMV), simian foamy virus (SFV), and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV). This application will expand the
percentage of SPF Level 2 rhesus while maintaining the current overall colony size. We will continue pedigree
determination for all colony animals and characterize the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I
(Mamu-A and -B) and Class II (Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci in our breeding SPF rhesus
macaques. This application will continue to collect fecal microbiome and peripheral blood lymphoid cells as a
biorepository for use by HIV/AIDS investigators. The four principal goals of this application are:
Continue to expand the SPF Level 2 population relative to Level 1 while maintaining overall colony size.
Develop improved and expanded screening and confirmatory tests for the detection of SPF agents to facilitate
the maintenance of the SPF colony. We will initiate annual surveillance for Trypanosoma cruzi in recognition of
the expansion of the geographic range of this parasitic infection. This work includes new assays for agents
such as tuberculosis, which represents the first SPF agent.
Maintain genetic analysis to determine the pedigree of Indian rhesus born into the colony and test all adult
breeders to characterize their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I (Mamu-A and -B) and Class II
(Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci.
Continue the collection and storage of intestinal microbiome and peripheral blood lymphocyte samples in a
unique SPF Level 2 biorepository to facilitate future research projects investigating the interaction of HIV with
the host microbiome and immune system."

 Management of chronic pain and opioid use/misuse is challenging for clinicians and students,
especially when working with diverse and underserved patient populations. Not all people are affected
by chronic pain and opioid use concerns equally, and there are higher prevalence rates in women,
individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, and people residing in rural areas. Medical and
health professional schools, students and practitioners need more educational resources to help
address the complex problems associated with the management of chronic pain, opioid use, and the
impact of diversity on clinical outcomes. Very few low-cost, flexible, highly-engaging, and effective
learning resources are available to help the healthcare workforce best learn to manage these unique
health concerns. Gamification holds promise as a user-friendly, fun, engaging and effective teaching
strategy, especially for healthcare applications. Palmetto Innovative Education LLC provides innovative
software and gaming solutions to help engage interprofessional teams of healthcare students,
researchers and clinicians with unique training opportunities. We seek to develop a convenient and
engaging educational platform to provide training in pain and opioid management as well as teach
empirically-supported communication strategies for optimizing treatment adherence. Typically, training
health professional students and practitioners via traditional didactic approaches falls short of engaging
learners in a manner that promotes application of knowledge. Conversely, gamification offers a lower-
cost, high quality, standardized, easily-accessible and flexible approach to healthcare provider
education that promotes application of acquired knowledge and increased engagement of learners.
Palmetto Innovative Education seeks to capitalize on the PI’s expertise as a pain management
clinician/educator and scientist, and combine these skills with his company’s game development
expertise and experience to create a novel, innovative and engaging educational game platform for
teaching students and practitioners alike about modern, empirically-supported strategies for pain and
opioid management. In this phase-I project, we seek to: (Aim-1) Develop a multi-platform educational
and interactive 3D digital game (SimuVersity Medical Center) to teach health professional students and
practicing clinicians modern and empirically validated strategies for pain and opioid management in
patients from a range of racial and ethnic backgrounds and with a variety of presenting pain and
substance use problems, and (Aim-2) Compare the effectiveness of this new educational activity/game
in meeting clinical learning objectives and outcomes compared to traditional didactic approaches to
provider and student education."

Our training program recruits diverse postdoctoral fellows, predominately physicians, and develops their skills
to conduct infectious disease epidemiology research. The program stresses epidemiology as a key tool to face
growing infectious disease threats. It highlights the global epidemiology of infectious disease, because the
increased connectivity of human populations means that the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases
requires a global perspective. The program will be interdisciplinary, engaging 29 faculty research mentors from
seven Departments (Medicine, Pediatrics, Epidemiology, Biology, Pathology and Microbiology, Immunology
and Civil and Environmental Engineering). Three trainees per year will be drawn from candidates for the
Infectious Diseases Fellowship Programs in Pediatrics and Internal Medicine; exceptional applicants from other
postdoctoral programs at Stanford may be considered if they have demonstrated prior commitment to
Infectious Diseases epidemiologic research. Trainees will conduct research under the mentorship of a program
faculty member committed to trainee success. Research is expected to be cross-disciplinary to take advantage
of the breadth of campus faculty and the varied exceptional research expertise available at Stanford. To
promote interaction among trainees and faculty we will convene research seminars conducted by trainees;
interdisciplinary seminars in infectious diseases epidemiology; weekly infectious diseases grand rounds;
lectures on infectious diseases, ecology and risks; and an annual one-day research retreat. Each trainee will
be counseled by a Research Committee comprised of their mentors and others with expertise relevant to the
research and to individual career goals. At least twice a year, trainees will meet with their mentors and the
program directors to discuss their Professional Development Plan. In addition, as part of this T32 renewal, we
propose to increase our emphasis on epidemiologic methods including requiring that all fellows supported by
the training grant complete four courses taught by the Department of Epidemiology in global infectious disease
epidemiology and modeling. This classroom instruction will complement the in-depth mentored research
experience so that trainees will develop both the content expertise and applied skills critical to become
independent researchers. All trainees will be strongly encouraged to apply for independent support. Trainees
will be appointed to the program for a year at a time. They will spend between 1 and 3 years in the program.
We envision that graduates of this program will assume independent research or public health leadership
positions and engage in careers that address the great infectious disease threats of their generation."

Our long-term aim is to understand glial roles in nervous system health, aging and disease in molecular detail.
The human nervous system has about equal numbers of glia cells and neurons, and interactions between
these two cell types is critical for neural functions. An important site of contact between glia and neurons is the
neuron-ending, where neurons receive input from other neurons (interneuron dendritic spine) or the
environment (sensory receptive-endings). Neuron-ending shape dictates appropriate neuron connectivity and
functions, including sensory perception and learning and memory. While it is appreciated that glia modulate
neuron-ending shapes and functions, molecular mechanisms underlying this remain poorly defined. Indeed,
many fundamental principles of glia-neuron interactions remain unclear, such as whether all glia-neuron pairs
interact using identical molecular mechanisms. It is however important to address this gap in our
understanding of glial functions, because impaired glia-neuron interactions are implicated in many neurological
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Autism, epilepsy and may contribute to neural decline with age.
We propose to dissect glia-neuron interactions in molecular detail in vivo, using C. elegans as a powerful and
genetically amenable experimental platform. C. elegans glia resemble vertebrate glia, and our recent studies
have validated this as a powerful setting to rapidly probe glia-neuron molecular interactions. We previously
identified two novel molecular mechanisms by which glia interact with neurons to regulate their shape,
functions and associated animal behaviors. All molecular components of these mechanisms that we have
uncovered so far are broadly expressed, suggesting that aspects of glia-neuron interactions are evolutionarily
conserved across species. Importantly, C. elegans glia are accessible for rapid and reproducible genetic and
cellular manipulations in vivo. Effects of such manipulation can be investigated at multiple levels of inquiry,
from molecular (genetic, genomic, protein biochemistry), cell-biology (cell shape, cell-cell contacts) and circuits
(functional imaging, mapped connectome) to animal behavior and aging studies, and disease models
(Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s). Here, we propose to dissect molecular mechanisms of glia-neuron interactions
throughout animal age in detail. For this, we will couple the experimental platform we established, and
techniques described above, with the multiple genetic mutants we recently identified to (1) determine how
multiple molecular pathways together enable interactions between a single glia-neuron pair; (2) investigate in
mechanistic detail how a single glia can differentiate associated neurons to regulate them differently, and (3)
dissect mechanisms by which different glia-neuron pairs interact to regulate neuron functions with age.
Together, these studies will build a comprehensive molecular framework of how a glia cell modulates the
functions of associated neurons throughout animal an animal’s lifespan."

 Identifying the cell types that compose each brain region and the patterns of connectivity that link them is
key to understanding how neural circuits give rise to all perception, cognition, and behavior. Large-scale projects
enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies are revealing that the brain contains thousands of cell
types, each with unique molecular features, axonal targets, and roles in brain function. However, the synaptic
connections between these cell types is currently determined using low throughput methods in which connectivity
between pairs of cells is tested one-by-one. Data describing connectivity at the cellular level have become a
essential for theoretical models of brain function, and necessitate the development of larger scale and higher
throughput methods. In remarkable proof of concept experiments, genetically encoded voltage indicators
(GEVIs) have been employed to visualize activity and infer the connectivity of cells within the brain. I propose to
leverage this advance to develop SYNMAP, an efficient all-optical method for measuring connectivity between
the thousands of genetically defined cell types that make up the mammalian brain. In SYNMAP, neural activity
will be both controlled and observed with light. Gene expression will be visualized across the same cells with
highly multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization in situ. Using SYNMAP, synaptic connectivity can be
assayed across molecularly defined cell types with 100X higher throughout than currently possible, allowing us
to test important hypotheses about neural circuit architecture across systems neuroscience. I will apply SYNMAP
to determine whether parallel thalamocortical pathways relay information from the basal ganglia and cerebellum
to discrete subcircuits in the motor cortex, taking us one step further towards understanding how motor actions
are planned and executed by motor systems spanning multiple brain regions. Optical physiology is being quickly
adopted by neurophysiology labs, promising the widespread application of SYNMAP across neuroscience.
Successful development of SYNMAP will be transformative, allowing us to study the structure and dynamics of
any neural circuit and its component cell types."
10906332,"Nuclear clearance and cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 have been reported in almost every age-dependent
neurodegenerative disease, including as the defining feature of a recently recognized dementia in the oldest of
the elderly, an AD-like syndrome named Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE), a
proportion of the hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD), >40% of frontal temporal dementia
(FTD), and >90% of instances of ALS. Our prior efforts (for which we now seek renewed support) have
established that transient stress can induce Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of cytoplasmic TDP-43 into
liquid droplets that then transition to a solid state, slowly deplete nuclear TDP-43, and provoke cell death over a
timescale of weeks. We also determined that partial or complete proteasome inhibition (to mimic the established
decline in proteosome activity during normal aging) provokes TDP-43 mislocalization/accumulation within the
cytoplasm. Quantitative mass spectrometry (with proximity-labeling and isobaric-tagging) has identified the small
heat shock protein HSPB1 to be a regulator of cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation and subsequent
aggregation. HSPB1 partitions into TDP-43 droplets, inhibits TDP-43 assembly into fibrils, and mediates
disassembly of stress-induced, TDP-43 droplets. Building on our prior and continuing work, we now propose to
determine 1) how the age-dependent decrease in proteasome activity drives TDP-43 loss of function,
cytoplasmic mislocalization, phase separation, and aggregation and 2) how protein chaperone HSPB1, in
conjunction with HSP70, affects cytoplasmic TDP-43 phase separation, inhibits TDP-43 assembly into fibrils,
and mediates disassembly of TDP-43 droplets. We have also initiated development of an approach to generate
new/replacement neurons in the aged adult mouse brain by transiently suppressing the RNA binding protein
Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein-1 (PTB) using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) delivered by a
single injection into cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Radial glial-like cells (and possibly other GFAP-expressing
cells) convert into new neurons over a two month period, acquire mature neuronal character, and functionally
integrate into endogenous circuits that modify mouse behavior. Here we will systematically identify the
functionality, localization, cell origin, timing, and molecular pathways of cells undergoing identity conversion, with
a primary assay the development and utilization of single cell RNA signatures obtained with spatial
transcriptomics (Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization [MERFISH])."

10921580,"ABSTRACT
This Phase I proposal seeks to improve a novel vaccine for human use against pathogens
transmitted by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. In previous studies, we proposed
that vaccine targeting of tick salivary proteins (Salps) critical for tick feeding would impair
tick feeding and consequently thwart the transmission of multiple tick-borne pathogens.
Our hypothesis is validated by the phenomenon of acquired tick-resistance wherein, upon
repeated tick infestations non-natural hosts such as rabbits, and guinea pigs mount a
robust immune response against tick Salps critical for tick feeding and this results in rapid
rejection of ticks and also prevents transmission of B. burgdorferi. Exploiting this
phenomenon, we identified several Salps that are avidly recognized by tick-resistant
animal sera.
Previous studies have successfully defined a 19Salp-mRNA (19ISP) cocktail that impairs
tick feeding, reduces tick engorgement, and blocks transmission of B. burgdorferi. These
results are now published in the journal Science Translational Medicine (Sajid et al, 2021,
13, eajb9827). Further experiments showed that a 12 mRNA-LNP subset is sufficient to
prevent tick feeding. However, erythema at the tick bite site in immunized animals raises
issues with the safety and commercial success of this experimental vaccine. In
preliminary experiments we have demonstrated that erythema is not sufficient to provoke
tick rejection. In this proposal we will further refine the antigen cocktail by eliminating
those antigens responsible for erythema and define a multiantigen mRNA vaccine that
blocks tick feeding and transmission of tickborne pathogens while eliciting no local
erythema at the bite site."

In South Africa (SA), the country with the world's largest HIV epidemic, ~45.6% of transgender women (TW) may
be living with HIV. Of these, estimates show that 1/3 are not in treatment. Furthermore, there is low engagement
with HIV prevention behaviors, such as ever having an HIV test (20.5%) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
use (11%). Data on syphilis outcomes, which significantly increase risk for HIV and viral load if already living with
HIV, are unknown in this context; though one estimate of prevalence in SA TW is ~9%. Dual self-testing for HIV
and syphilis may be a promising strategy to improve SA TW's uptake of regular HIV/syphilis testing and linkage
to PrEP and/or HIV/syphilis treatment. Specifically, self-testing is overwhelmingly supported by stakeholders in
SA, the infrastructure to scale-up self-testing is in place and rapidly expanding, analyses show that this strategy
is life and cost-saving in SA, and PrEP and HIV/syphilis treatment are widely available. Also, self-testing may
address the unique social/structural barriers affecting regular testing and subsequent linkage to services for TW,
including transphobia, health system mistrust, discrimination, stigma, cost, and privacy concerns. Thus,
interventions to improve dual self-testing uptake and linkage to PrEP and/or HIV/syphilis treatment following a
self-test are urgently needed for SA TW. Yet, we must first address 3 critical gaps in our knowledge, since
findings from studies on self-testing and linkage in other groups do not extend to TW; formative work shows
TW's life context is unique, and affects self-testing/linkage differently. Gaps include TW's needs/preferences on:
self-test access and uptake; logistical support needed to correctly use/interpret self-tests; and linkage to and
uptake of PrEP and/or HIV/syphilis treatment following self-tests. Using the INSTI Multiplex, a dual blood-based
HIV/syphilis test that delivers results in 1-minute, we use mixed-methods to inform these knowledge gaps and
draft a dual self-testing and linkage to care intervention tailored to TW. Research takes place in Johannesburg,
SA, brings together a gender diverse team and community advisory board (CAB), and is informed by the Mensch
Model; work will occur in 3 stages. In Stage 1, we will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with: N=15 TW and
N=15 healthcare workers (HCW) who care for TW. TW will use INSTI Multiplex in front of a study team member
to provide immediate feedback on logistical support needed to test/interpret results; they will also discuss
preferences on test access, and linkage. In Stage 2, we will enroll N=80 TW to complete self-administered web-
based surveys on their mobile phones. Surveys are developed from IDI themes and will identify TW's preferred
intervention strategy to address each domain. We will engage a data convergence process to ensure that
quantitative/qualitative findings inform one another. We will then draft the intervention using the 4 COM-B
Intervention Function Matrix. In Stage 3 we will engage an intervention development workgroup consisting of at
least n=5 members from each of the following groups: CAB, TW, HCW. We will present them draft intervention
to further develop/refine in 4 meetings of 90-minutes, each. The product will be piloted in a future R34."
10924821,"Project Summary
Globally, 2.7 million children are living with HIV and 270,000 new infections occur annually. With antiretroviral
therapy (ART) that suppresses viremia these children are surviving through adolescence into adulthood, but
ART may not fully restore immunologic health and inflammation may persist despite early ART initiation. In adults
living with HIV (ALHIV) inflammation has been associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular, metabolic and
neurocognitive age-related comorbidities than persons without HIV. Because immunologic and neurologic
development occur alongside exposure to HIV and ART in children with perinatal HIV (CPHIV), the long-term
consequences of inflammation may differ from adults and is largely unknown. In a cross-sectional study of
Kenyan CPHIV, we previously reported that inflammation persists despite viral suppression on ART. The
proposed research leverages this cohort in a 10-year follow up study to determine whether viral suppression on
prolonged ART dampens immune activation, the pathogenic mediators of inflammation and the consequences
of sustained inflammation with a global assessment of immunologic, cardiovascular, metabolic and
neurocognitive outcomes. The follow up cohort will include 80 persons with perinatal HIV (PPHIV) on ART for
~11 years and 82 persons unexposed to HIV (HU). In Aim 1, the durability of inflammation and immune
dysregulation in PPHIV on long-term ART with viral suppression will be assessed by comparing monocyte
(sCD14, sCD163), T cell (CD38, HLA-DR) and plasma (hsCRP, TNF-α, IL-6) inflammatory markers and innate
and adaptive immune cell subsets between baseline (T0, 2012 PIA study) and 10-year follow-up (T1) levels. The
pathogenic role of viral reservoir size and replicative capacity and intestinal permeability on immune activation
will also be assessed. In Aim 2 we will examine whether early (T0) or concurrent (T1) inflammatory markers
correlate with clinical outcomes including 1) cardiovascular measures of myocardial function by echocardiogram
and endothelial dysfunction by endothelial peripheral arterial tonometry (EndoPAT), 2) metabolic measures of
insulin resistance by HOMA-IR and pancreatic beta cell function and stress by HOMA-B and proinsulin/C-peptide
ratios and 3) neurocognitive assessments using NeuroScreen, a tablet-based tool that evaluates six
neuropsychological domains most affected by HIV. The proposed study will be among the first to
comprehensively examine multisystemic immunologic, cardiovascular, metabolic and neurocognitive outcomes
in PPHIV in sub-Saharan Africa after prolonged viral suppression. Our research will fill fundamental knowledge
gaps in understanding the role of early childhood inflammation in durable health outcomes of PPHIV, with
potential to identify screening biomarkers and implement preventative interventions that mitigate HIV-related
comorbidities so PPHIV can thrive as adults."
10930811,"There is an “epidemic of loneliness” with 20% of civilians and up to 50% of veterans reporting feeling lonely or
socially isolated. This is clinically important because loneliness and social isolation are strong predictors of
worse physical health and early mortality. Mental illness is intimately entwined with this epidemic because it
both causes and is worsened by loneliness and social isolation. It is the social deficits of mental illness that
most strongly contribute to loneliness and social isolation. These social deficits include difficulty understanding
other people’s behavior and difficulty behaving appropriately in social situations. Despite their importance,
these social deficits are poorly understood at the neural and behavioral levels and are difficult to quantify.
Moreover, available treatments for them are inadequate. I am the Director of the Bonding and Attunement in
Neuropsychiatric Disorders (BAND) lab, which comprises one junior faculty member supported by a CSR&D
Career Development Award, 5 postdoctoral fellows including MDs and PhDs, 4 graduate students, 6 paid
research assistants, over 20 volunteers. We believe the key to mental health and well-being starts with
strong relationships. Our mission is to develop novel pharmacological and cognitive interventions for
mental illness that enable patients to strengthen their connections to other people and the world. Our
work has primarily focused on understanding the psychological, behavioral, physiological, and neural effects of
administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin across multiple psychiatric illnesses. For example, we have
conducted numerous studies determining the acute effects of oxytocin administration in individuals with
schizophrenia. One highlight of this work is that we found that a single administration of oxytocin to individuals
with schizophrenia normalized neural activity during high-level social cognitive processing and that this
normalization was associated with improved behavioral performance. This work led to a VA CSR&D Merit
Award to conduct the largest randomized clinical trial of repeated administration of oxytocin in schizophrenia to
date. We have also conducted studies investigating oxytocin as a potential treatment for individuals with
alcohol, opioid, and stimulant use disorders, and co-occurring post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
alcohol use disorder (a common and difficult-to-treat comorbidity). We also recently completed a large
laboratory-based study in healthy individuals to determine whether acute oxytocin administration can
accelerate the development of team cohesion. This work led us to hypothesize that pharmacological
treatments that affect social processes could be paired with psychosocial treatments to possibly
achieve synergistically positive outcomes. To investigate this possibility, we have conducted studies pairing
administration of various drugs with social effects, including oxytocin, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine
(MDMA), and psilocybin, with various psychotherapy interventions including group-based psychotherapy. In
the non-pharmacological arena, we have been investigating attention bias modification delivered through a
smartphone app as a treatment for PTSD. Our studies incorporate multiple analytic approaches including
objective measures of social behavior such as eye-gaze, facial expressivity, team cohesion and performance,
quantification of social cognitive abilities, neuroimaging approaches, laboratory-based craving induction
paradigms, and quantification of psychophysiological changes and interpersonal synchrony. In sum, I have
developed a broad and highly productive trans-diagnostic program of research and assembled a large,
energetic, and multidisciplinary research group focused on developing and testing novel treatments for the
difficult to treat social deficits that cut across most psychiatric disorders. By improving social deficits across
disorders, veterans will have better social functioning and decreased symptom severity and will be able to
more effectively mobilize their social support networks and engage in other psychiatric treatment. This will lead
to better health outcomes and decreased costs for the VA health system."

The main mission of the P41 Biomedical Technology Research Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and
Bioinformatics (P41-GM104601) over the last three decades has been developing state of the art computational
technologies for biomolecular and cell simulations and visualization, implementing them in efﬁcient, economical,
user-friendly software solutions, and disseminating them to the biomedical community at no cost. The Resource
has enabled high-quality, rigorous research for the biomedical scientists who need to integrate molecular and
cell modeling, simulation, and visualization in their research, not only at diverse academic institutions, but also
in industry. The ﬂagship software programs, VMD and NAMD and their auxiliary plugins, are used currently
by more than 125,000 users and have received a staggering number of 57,000 citations (19,711 in 2018-2021
alone), reﬂecting the massive use of the technologies and programs developed by the Resource, and its sub-
stantial economies of scale. The Resource's partnership with the biomedical community resulted in the 2020
ACM Gordon Bell Special Prize for COVID-19 Research. Under the R24 mode of operation, a major goal of
the Resource will be to ensure that its software solutions remain current and available to its large user base on
existing and upcoming hardware platforms commonly used at local and institutional levels, and at national super-
computing centers, where a large fraction of the overall time is consumed by biomedical researchers using the
Resource's programs. Given the key position of these programs, several major supercomputing centers as well
as major hardware vendors have established strong relationships with the Resource, even directly supporting
software development and optimization. In addition, the Resource will ensure the utility of its programs by includ-
ing algorithmic changes/updates that are critical to applicability of the codes and/or demanded by the community.
The Resource will also sustain and expand its comprehensive user training program, empowered by an already
existing, large collection of online tutorials, case studies, and hands-on workshops. Another major activity of the
Resource will be to continue to support its users in the proper and efﬁcient application of the software programs
through customer support services and expanding and upgrading the documentation for the programs. The R24
Resource for Macromolecular Modeling and Visualization will be evaluated on a continuous basis by monitoring
quantitative metrics such as the number of its active users (users of multiple versions of software) and citations,
by conducting regular user surveys requesting input from the user community which will also assist in identifying
most critical features and improvements, and by the technical input from the external advisory board."

10930059,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is the leading cause of disability worldwide and current treatments are mostly
ineffective. The proposed project aims to use RNA-seq techniques with cellular resolution on nerve, joint, muscle,
and fascia tissues from thoroughly-phenotyped individuals with CLBP undergoing spine surgery to gain new
insight into CLBP. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptional changes in nerves and pathological tissues drive
human CLBP. We will test this hypothesis by applying single cell RNA-seq to tissue samples of thoroughly
characterized patients with CLBP undergoing surgery. In our first aim we will apply single nucleus and bulk RNA-
seq to the peripheral and neural tissues outlined above. We hypothesize that peripheral and neural tissues from
patients with CLBP will display shifts in cell types and ligands that give insight into distinct mechanisms of CLBP.
In our second aim we will apply our computational interactome model to our RNA-seq data to identify ligand-
receptor interactions between cells/tissues associated with CLBP and neuronal transcriptomes. We will
associate nociceptor phenotypes assembled from our collective DRG datasets from organ donors and chronic
pain patients to create interactome profiles from CLBP tissues, and associate these interactomes to pain
phenotypes. Finally, in our third aim we will conduct in vitro pharmacology studies on human DRG neurons from
organ donors to understand how putative pain mediators act on nociceptors. The project will lead to a new
understanding of CLBP, and elucidate pain phenotype-specific therapeutic opportunities based entirely on
human molecular neuroscience. The research project will serve as an example of how platforms that are based
entirely on the use of human samples and tissues can be developed for discovery, target identification and
clinical validation for other pain disorders."

RhoA, a member of the Rho-family of small GTPases, centrally regulates actin organization and actomyosin contractility. RhoA dynamics coordinate actin stress fiber formation, which ultimately determines how cells generate cytoskeletal tension to transmit mechanical forces to/from neighboring cell-cell junctions and focal adhesions with the extracellular matrix (ECM). Thus, new tools to control the dynamics of RhoA signaling may enhance understanding of how cells make decisions in response to mechanical stimuli. We propose to create optogenetic tools for bi-directional (activation and inactivation) control over RhoA signaling, systematically characterize their function through a set of physiological assays in contractility and mechanotransduction, and benchmark their performance against other reported optogenetic technologies. We will use our recently discovered BcLOV4 photoreceptor that dynamically translocates via a direct light-induced protein-lipid interaction with the plasma membrane, making ii powerful for single-component optogenetic control over peripheral membrane proteins that is robust across cell types and primary cells. To demonstrate the unique capabilities of the toolbox, we will quantitatively map the cytoskeletal signaling and tensional dynamics of a known RhoA/Y AP mechanotransductive feedback loop in cytoskeletal remodeling and persistent cell motility, through simultaneous optogenetic perturbation and multi-reporter imaging. This toolbox will broadly impact cell and cytoskeletal biology by advancing control over ubiquitous RhoA signaling to probe its diverse regulatory roles in cell contractility, motility, mechanotransduction, and regeneration."

The humoral immune system relies on the rich diversity of the antibody binding repertoire to generate targeted
responses to the vast array of antigens one may encounter, and much work has been done to characterize the
factors generating this diversity. However, allelic variation at the highly polymorphic immunoglobulin heavy chain
(IGH) gene locus has remained largely unexplored as a factor impacting the specificity of antibody responses to
both infection and vaccination. While many antigens are capable of eliciting strong neutralizing responses across
the population regardless of IGH haplotype, recent studies have shown that certain alleles encoding IGH gene
segments impact the magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses to viral antigens in humans. Differential
development of neutralizing antibody titers in response to HIV immunogens across individuals is well
documented, with only around 20% of HIV infected individuals developing broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bNAbs). Similarly, BG505.SOSIP.664, a tier 2 HIV envelope glycoprotein (env) immunogen, has been shown
to elicit a wide range of humoral responses in rhesus macaques (RM), with some developing high titers of nAbs
capable of protection against autologous SHIV challenge, while others develop very low nAb titers not capable
of such protection. We hypothesize that germline IGH polymorphisms and allelic representation within the
antigen specific B cell repertoire contribute to the variation in Nab titers observed in response to BG505
SOSIP.664 vaccination. The goal of this project is to determine how allelic variation at IGH genes in rhesus
macaques affects the development of nAbs, in the following two Specific Aims: (1) to identify IGH polymorphisms
in RM vaccinated with BG505SOSIP.644 associated with differential development of nAb titers (2) to identify the
epitope specificity of the antibody repertoire encoded by alleles associated most strongly with high nAb titers.
These experiments will uncover a factor contributing to the diversity of humoral immune responses at the
population level, and in doing so we will contribute to the establishment of a non-human primate model for
studying the effects of genotype on antibody responses to vaccines against various human pathogens. Our
results will greatly enhance the rational design and development of germline targeting vaccines."
10925205,"Research in biomedical and bioengineering careers increasingly relies on rapidly evolving
domain-specific data analysis skills and the expert management of information and knowledge.
The need for such preparation is most acute among urban students who are multicultural,
multilingual, and low-income; who persistently underachieve academically compared to their
majority culture peers. This underachievement is a key factor in dissuading high school students
from considering college education. Hence, there is an urgent need to prepare the future research
workforce in biomedical informatics. One of the primary reasons for the Department of Biohealth
Informatics (DBI) at the School of Informatics and Computing (SoIC), Indiana University Purdue
University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus to be hosting this R25 education program is the recently
approved Biomedical Informatics (BMI) baccalaureate degree program, which is the only such
program in Indiana and the third in the nation, to educate students in a rapidly growing field, to
address the shortage of informatics-trained research workforce in biomedicine. Since we also
have a highly successful accelerated BS+MS program that allows students to complete both a
baccalaureate and master’s degrees in five years, the students will be encouraged to participate
in this degree pathway that will prepare them for higher-paying job opportunities in the fields of
bioinformatics and health informatics. Along with this, our campus represents the amalgamation
of two of the leading research-focused universities in Indiana - Indiana and Purdue Universities,
and hosts the largest medical school in the nation. Long-term industry collaborations with leading
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and company, faculty joint appointments with leading
research sites, like the Regenstrief Institute and an extensive existing network of interactions with
numerous Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), make the SoIC/IUPUI an appropriate site to host
this NLM R25 research education program - whose goals are to reduce gender and race
disparities in the biomedical, behavioral and clinical research workforce by targeting academically
talented students who come from economically disadvantaged (ED) and/or underrepresented
minority (URM) populations. The objective here is to provide hands-on research experience
during summer in their junior, senior undergraduate and first-year graduate years and keep them
motivated to pursue research careers while taking advantage of access to accelerated degrees
available on campus. Since informatics in biomedicine impacts a wide variety of interdisciplinary
fields, proposed summer research experiences will benefit undergraduate and graduate student

component of the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) is a highly collaborative group of investigators
whose aims to validate biomarkers for the early detection and risk assessment of cancers of the gastrointestinal

circulating and stool based biomarkers will increase the adherence to colorectal screening and in doing so reduce
mortality caused by colorectal cancers. Based on the rising incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) among adults
age <50 in the US, and the low compliance and high mortality in underserved populations, increased emphasis
is placed on these populations. The GLNE also proposes to continue its ongoing support of EDRN discovery
priorities. We propose to address the following aims: (1) Primary Aim To expand and renew the archive of
appropriately preserved stool, serum, plasma, urine, tissue and DNA biospecimens to be used by EDRN
investigators for current and future validation and biomarker discovery research with expanded inclusion of
subjects with early-onset CRC and underserved populations. This will allow assessment of the utility of individual
stool-based, and serum-based biomarkers and biomarker panels for discriminating between individuals without
neoplasia (subjects both at average and higher risk for developing colon cancer), and those with colon cancer
or screen-relevant neoplasia (cancer plus advanced adenoma), and construction of panels of markers to
discriminate between these groups. (2) To perform validation trials of promising biomarkers discovered by EDRN
investigators, external collaborating institutions and collaborating EDRN industrial partners for the early detection
of colorectal neoplasia. In this context we propose to (a) to clinically validate (via a methods comparison study)
the performance of a point-of-care blood- based biomarker panel with the testing of serum/plasma samples
obtained in clinics serving low-income and underserved communities and (b) to clinically validate an established
4-plex stool protein panel for early diagnosis of CRC. (3) To follow prospectively subjects enrolled in an
established prospective Phase 2 validation trial to identify pre-diagnostic specimens which may be used to
develop predictive markers."
10921726,"The overarching objective of the Aguiar laboratory is to improve our understanding of cancer
biology, in particular the molecular and cellular basis of B cell lymphomas development and
progression with the intent of translating these discoveries into clinical activities. The Aguiar
laboratory uses in vitro and in vivo systems, in genome-wide or focused approaches, to
investigate the pathogenesis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is the most
common B cell cancer in adults, with ~25000 new cases diagnosed yearly in the US alone.
Importantly, DLBCL remains incurable in ~40% of the patients, and the last time that this
suboptimal cure rate was improved, it was 20 years ago with the addition of rituximab (anti-CD20
antibody) to classical chemotherapy. Thus, the field has coalesced around the concept that to
improve DLBCL outcome, we first need to better understand this disease biology, and impact on
its clinical heterogeneity. Towards this end, the Aguiar group currently has three active lines of
investigation: 1) the Aguiar lab is examining the interplay between mitochondrial metabolism and
epigenetic modulation. In this area of knowledge, they recently made substantial contributions.
First, they discovered that a subset of DLBCLs harbor loss of function mutations in D2HGDH,
which encodes a mitochondrial enzyme that converts the natural metabolite D-2-HG into alpha-
ketoglutarate (αKG). The main consequence of these mutations is depletion of the cellular pool
of αKG and hypermethylation (DNA/RNA/histone). Subsequently, the Aguiar lab showed that
MYC, a central lymphoma oncogene, regulates D2HGDH expression and thus, via modulation of
intermediary metabolism, can modify the cellular epigenome. The ultimate objective of this broad
research activity is to test the concept that αKG supplementation possess anti-lymphoma
properties, an idea that the Aguiar lab has already validated pre-clinically. 2) The Aguiar research
program is also invested in expanding and further credentialling phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) as
an actionable therapeutic target in mature B cell malignancies. This is a long-standing research
line in their group, which started with the discovery that the expression of the gene PDE4B was
uniquely elevated in fatal DLBCL cases. Subsequently, in a collection of impactful publications
across a decade of pre-clinical work, the Aguiar lab showed that high PDE4 expression and
activity blunts the inhibitory effects of cyclic-AMP towards the B cell receptor (BCR), which thus
remains abnormally active in DLBCL. The Aguiar laboratory then discovered that this oncogenic
signal can be turned off with PDE4 inhibitors, a concept that they validated in two recent
completed clinical trials. A third, pivotal randomized phase 2 trial has been open and will start
accruing in the fall. In this study, Dr. Aguiar and his clinical co-leaders aim to confirm the benefit
of adding PDE4 inhibitors to the first line treatment of DLBCL. 3) Another active research line in
the Aguiar group relates to the impact that lymphoma cell intrinsic programs may have on the
tumor microenvironment. Their focus here is on somatic mutations found in transcription factors,
which unexpectedly perturb antigen presentation and anti-cancer immunity. These studies have
the potential to identify patients that may be particularly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitor
agents. Taken together, with a focus on a common and often fatal cancer type, the Aguiar
laboratory is working on multiple aspects of basic lymphoma biology all of which converge towards
concrete clinical applications."

Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated immune response of the
patient to infection, is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. Annually, sepsis accounts for
~100,000 emergency department (ED) and ~25-50% of children with sepsis will die due to complications that
include shock and multiple organ dysfunction. These unacceptably high bad outcomes are mostly because of
our limited understanding of the fundamental underlying immune response processes at the cellular level that
are involved in pediatric sepsis. There is an urgent need for generating high quality evidence using
multidisciplinary teams to rapidly and accurately diagnoses sepsis so that appropriate therapies can be
initiated in the ED to reduce morbidity and mortality in children.
We believe that the patient has a unique “sepsis” signature when they first present to the ED and we can
define this signature by studying the changes in the vital signs (such as temperature, heart rate) and initial
laboratory tests, i.e. physiologic profile along with tests that measure the immune response i.e. the
immunologic profile and their changes in the ribosomal nucleic acids (RNA) at the cellular level i.e.
transcriptomic profile. We will also be able to better identify the cause of sepsis i.e. bacteria or non-bacteria (for
e.g. viruses) using a more sensitive and faster turnaround test called nanorod PCR, which will help the ED
provider in initiating appropriate treatments. We also believe that the changes in the sepsis signature over time
will allow us to reliably predict which child is more at risk for developing complications and death very early in
the disease course to help reduce sepsis related mortality.
In order to achieve our aims, we will conduct a prospective, observational study in children (3 months ≤ 18
years of age) with suspected sepsis in the ED at a tertiary care Children’s Hospital and monitor patients
through their inpatient stay (ICU, general unit). We have assembled a team of experienced investigators and
have the necessary resources and expertise to achieve the goals of our project that are directly aligned with
the NOSI to Advance Understanding and Management of MODS in Children. Our project is the first step
towards precision medicine to improve diagnosis, guide appropriate therapies, and reliably prognosticate
patient outcomes in children with sepsis."

Sex and age are the primary risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. After
decades of failed clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is an urgent need for creative
approaches to uncover new therapeutic targets. While women experience a greater prevalence, more severe
neuropathology, and greater cognitive decline with AD, men diagnosed with AD progress more quickly to death.
However, little is known about the mechanisms (whether hormonal or sex chromosomal) driving the sex-biased
response to AD pathology with brain aging. Our long-term goal is to identify the underlying mechanisms
governing the sex-biased response to AD. Recent GWAS studies have identified several AD risk loci in genes
exclusively expressed by microglia, shifting the field to explore potential causative roles of microglia in AD. As
well, microglia show profound phenotypic sex differences with aging and AD. We hypothesize that sex
differences in microglial responsivity contribute mechanistically to the sex-biased disease progression seen in
AD. Although the onset of AD correlates to the menopausal transition in women, hormone replacement therapies
(HRT) have generated mixed results. The formerly under-appreciated role of sex chromosomal contributions has
recently come to the forefront in AD research, with a special emphasis on X-encoded histone modifiers. The
objective of this study is to determine if sex chromosome complement (XX v. XY), independent of sex hormones,
alters pathological progression and microglial activational profiles in AD and test the hypothesis that X-encoded
lysine-specific demethylase Kdm6a contributes to the sexually divergent microglial response to AD. Our specific
aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) sex chromosome complement alters survival and pathological
progression (plaques/tangles, microgliosis) of AD; (Aim 2) sex chromosomally regulated differences in
heterogeneous microglial cell responses to aging and AD are driven, in part, by alterations in histone
modifications (H3K27me3); (Aim 3) microglial X-encoded Kdm6a expression is sufficient to cause sexually-
divergent microglial response to AD through genome-wide, targeted removal of repressive H3K27me3. The
paired phenotypic and multi-omic data generated in these studies will facilitate the identification of sex-
differentially regulated genomic programs that confer protection or risk to the progression of AD in both sexes in
order to prioritize targets for small molecule or epigenome editing for therapeutic intervention in AD. The research
plan is innovative because we investigate sex differences in AD through the lens of sex chromosomes and utilize
ground-breaking transcriptomic, epigenomic, and analytical techniques to gain a previously unattainable
resolution of microglia heterogeneity."

The goal of this Phase I SBIR program is the development of an optimized, off-the-shelf alternative to autologous
fat grafting for soft tissue repair. Fat grafting is commonly used as a minimally invasive alternative to synthetic
implants or major reconstructive surgery (e.g., free flaps) for the repair of damaged, lost, or surgically resected
soft tissue, with particular focus on craniofacial, breast, and extremity reconstruction. It is one of the fastest
growing procedures in plastic surgery with an estimated 80% of reconstructive surgeons already incorporating
the procedure in their practice. However, fat grafting requires liposuction, an operation which liquifies the fat,
exposing it to shear forces which limit the capacity of fat to survive and retain shape once re-injected. A product
which can deliver the same results as an autologous graft in an office procedure without the need to process
and harvest tissue would be poised for rapid market adoption in this expanding field. To this end, this Phase I
grant will evaluate the collaborative combination of inSoma Bio’s tissue repair matrix – FractomerTM – with
Renuva®, an industry-leading adipose allograft material marketed through the Musculoskeletal Transplant
Foundation (MTF Biologics) as an off-the-shelf alternative to autologous fat transfer. Renuva is marketed to
restore volume in the face, hands, and body, and has shown significant clinical outcomes, restoring the adipocyte
population at the site of injection; however, cadaver-based products across the board are inherently limited by
scale and donor sourcing. As a result, access to markets for larger repairs such as facial reconstruction, surgical
sites such as lumpectomy defects, and regions of tissue wasting (e.g., lipodystrophy) are limited. Fractomer, on
the other hand, is a biosynthetic protein scaffold which can be produced at large scale using simple fermentation
and is designed to replicate the extracellular matrix. Fractomer has been shown to support long-term viability,
vascularization, and shape-retention when co-injected with human lipoaspirate. A product composed of both
Fractomer and Renuva has clear potential to supply both the scaffold and cellular cues needed without the need
to harvest tissue from the patient as well as significantly increase the maximum repair volume capacity, allowing
access to previously unreachable markets. Preliminary studies have already confirmed the capacity for these
two products to complement one another, and this SBIR will allow optimization of a commercially viable
formulation. Phase I studies will include testing mixtures of Fractomer and Renuva for injectability, thermally-
induced phase transition, shape retention, and support for cellular viability. In vivo studies will then be undertaken
to monitor cellular composition, adipogenesis, and signs of any adverse effect from inflammation or necrosis.
The resulting product would expand the range of surgical procedures suited to fat grafting, and provide a safer,
cost-effective, and off-the-shelf product which eliminates the need for painful fat harvesting surgeries."
10915921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The success of mRNA vaccines in controlling the COVID 19 pandemic has confirmed the efficacy of mRNA and
has also provided a blueprint on how to construct these vectors in terms of structure and cost. We have recently
developed a new mRNA platform that, unlike current mRNA vaccines/therapeutics, does not require a 5’ cap to
function, dramatically reducing the cost. More efficient at protein translation than canonical (capped) mRNA
vectors, these mRNA vectors initiate translation from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and contain a
specially designed self-folding secondary structure to protect the 5’ end against degradation, significantly
improving its stability and protein expression. The produced mRNA does not require any additional modifications
to be functional. This makes this mRNA design attractive for use as a vaccine or therapeutic.
In this STTR Phase I proposal, investigators at CompoVax and the University of South Alabama will test this
(capless) mRNA design as a vaccine and compare it against a classical (capped) mRNA vaccine in mice. The
vaccines will express either the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the Influenza A hemagglutinin surface protein.
The proposal will provide evidence that this capless mRNA vaccine platform can generate a robust immune
response and can be used as an affordable substitution to current mRNA vaccines and therapeutics."
10916890,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The young brain displays remarkable plasticity. This includes an ability to remodel neuronal synaptic connections
to learn new tasks in health, as well as being able to repair connections and restore function after injury. In the
adult brain there are active mechanisms in place that maintain neuronal circuit connectivity and synaptic stability,
which is necessary for typical brain function, but acts as a barrier to targeted synaptic remodeling in situations
where this is beneficial, for example to enhance learning, or to repair neurons after injury. Removal of factors
from the adult brain that limit plasticity is sufficient to enable enhanced remodeling and repair. However, these
manipulations lead to a permanent reopening of plasticity states, which is detrimental to long-term brain function
by non-specifically destabilizing synaptic connections. Therefore, new approaches are needed to transiently
enhance neuronal plasticity state to enable controlled synaptic remodeling and repair. There is compelling
evidence that manipulating proteins in the extracellular space surrounding neurons is sufficient to enhance
plasticity and synaptic remodeling. For example, proteins secreted by non-neuronal glial cells, specifically
astrocytes, are sufficient to induce synapse maturation and stabilization, and permanent removal of these factors
from adult astrocytes enables enhanced plasticity and repair. This demonstrates a role for specific secreted
proteins in repressing plasticity in the adult brain, suggesting their targeted removal may be beneficial. Therefore,
the first goal of this proposal is to ask if acute degradation of specific extracellular proteins is able to reopen brief,
controlled, windows of plasticity to enable enhanced learning or to promote synaptic repair after injury. This will
be achieved by developing a genetically encoded system for Targeted Degradation of Extracellular Proteins
(TDEP). TDEP will use nanobodies that bind the protein of interest, coupled to a degradation-targeting sequence
for uptake and removal by endogenous brain cells. As proof-of-concept TDEP will be developed to degrade
known astrocyte-secreted proteins that stabilize synapses, and determine whether acute protein degradation is
sufficient to reopen transient windows of synaptic plasticity, assayed using visual system plasticity, injury models
and learning and memory paradigms. The second goal is to identify the complete repertoire of extracellular
proteins that contribute to repressing plasticity in adulthood, and their cellular source, to enable their precise
targeting for degradation and plasticity enhancement. This will be achieved by labeling newly-synthesized
proteins secreted from specific brain cells under different plasticity conditions, using proximity labeling of proteins
with biotin by the enzyme TurboID, targeted to different subcellular compartments from which extracellular
proteins originate. This will generate an atlas of the cellular origin of extracellular proteins, and will be used to
identify candidates for TDEP targeting for plasticity enhancement. The outcome will be a toolkit of genetic
reagents that enable precise control of the neuronal environment to promote brain health and repair, with lasting
impact on multiple areas of neuroscience where enhancing brain plasticity would improve function."

 In its renewal application, the Wilmer K12 Program seeks to continue its successful recruitment and
development of new investigators in highly relevant areas of clinical and laboratory vision research. Our past
track record indicates success in mentored training of young scientists who enter full-time academic research
careers and compete effectively for individual and collaborative grant support. Due to our reputation for
clinician—scientist training and the diversity of major research areas in vision science that are available to
scholars, we have every year attracted multiple highly attractive candidates for the Wilmer K12 program. Our
structured program still leaves considerable flexibility to take advantage of multiple—mentor groups for training
in a combination of didactic and practical activities. The existence of a Departmental executive committee for
ongoing oversight of every K awardee (K12, K08 and K23) assures that each scholar will be given updated
review of their program and correction of areas that are not functioning ideally. Specific timelines and
guidelines for following of each K scholar program are strictly enforced. Our progress report shows that the
progression to independent research careers and R level funding for Wilmer K12 graduates is far above the
national standard as published. As shown by the faculty involvement of 37 scientists, many of whom were K
awardees themselves, the institutional expertise and commitment to this program is a high priority of the
Wilmer Institute. The combined research grants of the K12 participating faculty comprises a total direct cost
this year of over $30 million. This ensures that adequate funding is available to support the costs of mentored
training that are not covered by the K awards themselves. Wilmer has produced more full time academics and
Department Chairpersons than any other eye institute or department in the U.S. Furthermore, each
K12/K08/K23 scholar at Wilmer benefits from a mentor team than includes not only Ophthalmology faculty, but
scientists from other departments at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, the
Applied Physics Laboratory, and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. These collaborations cross-fertilize
both scholar training and the research environment of the Institute, and have included members of
Departments such as Neuroscience, Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Epidemiology, International Health,
and Computer Science. The Executive Committee is vigilant to assure that the mentors and mentees are both
fulfilling their roles, with written evaluations at regular intervals. The Executive Committee consists of
experienced and diverse vision scientists, some of whom recently were in K training and others who have over
many years mentored multiple K scholars. The co-Program Director, Dr. Quigley, has mentored over 50
clinician—scientists, including Department Chairs and Division Directors in more than a dozen institutions
nationally and internationally. The other co-Program Director, Dr. Handa, is a distinguished clinician—scientist
with continuous laboratory funding, recently the Chair of a visual sciences NIH study section, past K11
awardee, and with multiple past K mentees.The facilities of Wilmer's clinical and lab research are
unsurpassed, including the 200,000 square foot Smith Building."
10918150,"The overall goal of the Cleveland Open Source Modular Implant Innovators Community (COSMIIC) is
to establish an open source, modular network of active implantable devices for use in early feasibility human
research and to provide ongoing support for this technology through a vibrant, sustainable community of active
users. Our team is poised to successfully achieve all of the goals of the HORNET program because our
proposed concept is based on our established platform ecosystem, the Networked Neuroprosthesis (NNP).
This provides a solid technological platform with known regulatory status for our COSMIIC HORNET project.
Critically, all technology described in this proposal was invented by the investigative team and
therefore we are able to fully embrace the open source ideology for the end-to-end technology.
 The proposed COSMIIC HORNET System, which will be established on the platform NNP System, is a
system of interoperable and integrated modules that can simultaneously electrically activate, block, and sense
throughout the body. The system can record and process electroneurogram (ENG), electromyogram (EMG),
intracortical signals, electrocardiogram (EKG), kinematic variables, photoplethysmogram (PPG), and
temperature. Each module can directly communicate with all other modules through an established network
communication protocol. The system can process signals to implement complex closed-loop control without
requiring non-implanted hardware. Importantly, the existing NNP platform components (power module,
stimulator module, biopotential recording module, network cable, electrodes) already have IDE approval from
the FDA and have been successfully implanted and implemented in human research participants. Thus, the
COSMIIC HORNET System has the necessary features to provide the modular platform ecosystem for use by
the bioelectronic community for the foreseeable future.
 Aim #1. Dissemination. We will establish the COSMIIC community with full open-source access to
an established modular implantable device for use in the peripheral and central nervous system. Access will
be given for all circuit designs and layouts; mechanical drawings for all enclosures and connectors and cabling;
the annotated code for all operating software, firmware, and bootloader; written instructions and videos of
fabrication techniques; and all regulatory documents and test data, including our approved IDE document.
 Aim #2. Sustainability. We will develop a sustainable open source model through the development of
technology that attracts a broad investigative team to establish a critical mass of COSMIIC users. We will
provide ongoing support of the technology and partner with commercial partners to create a sustainable
business plan so that the COSMIIC community remains independently vibrant and active after three years."

TOP-TIER (Training OPportunities in Translational Imaging Education and Research) is a clinician scientist
post-doctoral training program at Washington University (WU) in St. Louis designed with the purpose of
providing trainees with instruction in the performance of rigorous translational imaging research. The goal
is to prepare resident and fellow trainees for careers as successful independent investigators and to
ultimately become leaders in their field, developing imaging techniques and applications that translate into
human subjects and impact healthcare. Precision Medicine is an approach to disease treatment and
prevention that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. Development
of methods of patient-specific biomarker imaging to guide and monitor patient-specific therapies will be
needed to advance Precision Medicine. Moreover, a trained workforce is key to taking advantage of new
developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence which can be applied across disciplines, to
include targeted molecular imaging, photoacoustics, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in terms of
data acquisition, image processing, and diagnosis. Such imaging advances are interdisciplinary with
technology innovations crossing the physical, biological, and data sciences. These studies start with
preclinical mechanistic inquiries using targeted pathology-based imaging in animal disease models, and
then expand into human subjects. Human studies include safety testing and the Food and Drug
Administration’s (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) and Device Exemption (IDE) process. The ultimate
goal is to make research innovations widely available to the public and the entire practicing medical
community. Although this “bench-to-bedside” process has been widely acclaimed, there remains a
knowledge gap in the medical imaging research community as to how to take preclinical research into
humans, and how to then take these innovations to the public. Moreover, clinical scientists – residents and
fellows – often lack the understanding to navigate research regulatory requirements as well as the
knowledge base to understand or perform preclinical research that will inform the mechanism of innovation.
In this T32 renewal, we have optimized training to provide supportive Mentoring Teams and cover technical
advances, research rigor, and the practical aspects of grant submission to better prepare future imaging
scientists for the challenges of performing science which impacts healthcare."

A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior.
Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory
input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s
pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in
understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin
(i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also
critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration
of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual
and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and
manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor
assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory
behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific
premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a
critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both
corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this
novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how
touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches,
high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis
that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to
cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network
shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral
studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub-
second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements
are pieced together into complex motor behaviors
. By understanding the final path for movement organization
(i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people
suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways
to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function."

The delivery of molecules and particles to cells is important for increased scientific understanding of molecular
processes and networks, detecting intracellular biomarkers in diagnostic targets, and genetic modification of
therapeutic cells. The challenges associated with current delivery approaches include limits to the size of
molecules that can be delivered (especially plasmid DNA), damage or modification to target cells, and a limit to
the cell processing throughput. In studies to develop new methods that can be used to deliver molecules and
particles more broadly to many cell types, a novel cellular behavior was discovered that occurs as cells are
rapidly compressed at timescales faster than a millisecond. As a result of fast compressions upon cells, cells
respond by a temporary change of volume, which results in a pressure driven flow across the cell membrane to
restore cell volume, and as a byproduct carries extracellular reagents into a cell through a convective
phenomenon. The goal of this study is to understand how to optimize devices exploiting a new biophysical
regime of cell compression in which fast timescales (<1 millisecond), high strain (>30%) to impact cells. These
physical impacts of cells are increasingly important to understand due to applications in lab on a chip, cell
sorting, and cell engineering. Secondly, the microfluidic technology will be optimized and tested for microfluidic
delivery of probes and labels, as well as transfection of large transgenes for a variety of important cell types.
The understanding of cell mechanical responses in an unexplored region of time and magnitude could enable
new approaches to label and reprogram the cell that will be efficient to a broad range of cell types and

By the age of 3 years, Latino children are disproportionately affected by deficient sleep (short sleep duration,
poorly timed sleep) and obesity. However, few studies have considered predictors of deficient sleep and its
relationship with the disparate prevalence of early childhood obesity, specifically in toddlers (12 to 39 months)
from Mexican American families. Because sleep is influenced by many different factors, this study will be one
of the first to evaluate socioecological predictors, including environmental (e.g., societal, neighborhood,
household), sociocultural (e.g., acculturation, beliefs), and parental factors (e.g., sleep-related parenting
practices) in this population. While the relationship between deficient sleep and obesity has been found in
children and adolescents, research with toddlers is limited by a lack of long-term studies and the use of parent

of the ecology in which parent and toddler sleep are embedded, and the relationship of sleep with toddler
weight status in the target population. To ensure the child’s entire family system is considered, mothers,
fathers, and other primary caregivers in the home will be included. Altogether, study findings will contribute to
the future development of family-focused, culturally-tailored, and contextually-informed early prevention
programs focused on sleep and weight status in this underserved population. This study is a critical next step

primary caregivers residing in the home) with 12 to 15 month old children living in a large metropolitan area to
participate in 3 annual assessments. At each assessment, questionnaire and anthropometric data will be
collected, and parent and toddler sleep will be measured by 7 consecutive days/nights of actigraphy (a wrist-
watch sized device that objectively measures sleep). This innovative study will provide an in-depth evaluation
of the ecology in which parent and toddler sleep are embedded, and the relationship of sleep with toddler
weight status in the target population. To ensure the child’s entire family system is considered, mothers,
fathers, and other primary caregivers in the home will be included. Altogether, study findings will contribute to
the future development of family-focused, culturally-tailored, and contextually-informed early prevention
programs focused on sleep and weight status in this underserved population. This study is a critical next step
toward reducing health disparities and improving health outcomes among toddlers from Mexican American
families."
10910113,"Our brain and immune system interface throughout the body to communicate in health and disease, but whether neurological disease results as a failure of neuro-immune cross-talk is currently unknown. Our immune system is in constant flux- highly in tune with our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. It isn't surprising that an injury as devastating as a traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long-term consequences on our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. And so, it stands to reason that the immune system itself is also compromised after TBI. Indeed, experimental and clinical studies alike show widespread changes in circulating leukocytes and plasma cytokine levels of acute TBI patients. While these measures serve as useful correlates of functional outcome, the source of these changes is often overlooked. Bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) continuously give rise to all blood cell types that make up the immune system, potentially making them key cellular effectors of neuro-immune communication. Consequently, changes in the health of the bone marrow niche alter the composition of our immune system and have a profound impact on immunity. The self- renewing capacity of HSCs and their location in the body make them viable targets for therapeutic manipulation. The aim of this proposal is to understand how TBI affects BM hematopoietic function, and in turn, how downstream changes in peripheral immunity impact the progression of TBI.  By tracking the outcome of chronically injured mice over time and assessing their response to infection we will ascertain the extent to which TBI causes BM dysfunction, premature senescence, and bidirectional impairment. We will implement a novel BM chimera strategy to study the neurological consequences of TBI- induced changes in BM function and whether these changes can be self-corrected (Aim 1). Using this comprehensive description of the neuro-immune processes underlying chronic TBI we will then determine the molecular mechanisms by which BM HSCs go awry with brain injury (Aim 2) and intervene therapeutically at late time points to eliminate senescent microglia/macrophages, restore innate immunity, and ameliorate chronic inflammation (Aim 3). The completion of these aims seeks to unmask the role of BM as a major communication hub of the neuro-immune axis, and its progenitor cells as the primary effectors of chronic inflammation, immune dysfunction, and TBI disease progression.  To further guide my research and career development, I will be advised by an interdisciplinary team of experienced mentors and experts in traumatic brain injury, innate immunity, and stem cell biology. This ensemble of mentors will ensure my research project and career development needs are met through frequent meetings and interaction. My overall career goal is to be an independent investigator at a major research institution. The K award would provide the springboard required to reach this goal, allow me to develop my own original research program, and put me on a path to be an independent, early stage investigator."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, affects over 6.2 million Americans and 50
million individuals worldwide. Ten to fifteen years prior to the onset of cognitive symptoms, AD pathology
begins to appear in the brain. While the primary pathology associated with AD include amyloid beta and
hyperphosphorylated tau, the pathogenesis of AD remains elusive. Other changes in the AD brain include
derangements in cerebral glucose metabolism. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted an association
between AD and systemic metabolic impairment (i.e. diabetes). This indicates a major role of altered
metabolism in AD, and warrants examination of how metabolic risk may contribute to brain health and
dementia risk. Biomarker studies of brain structure and function offer potential opportunities for early detection
of AD, and for improving our understanding of factors relating to disease risk. Functional connectivity, a
measure of correlated neural activity in two brain regions can be measured by resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). This functional neuroimaging approach has emerged as a potential
biomarker for AD diagnosis and disease monitoring. Importantly, metabolic risk has previously been
associated with altered functional connectivity. However, data regarding early forms of metabolic risk, like
prediabetes, is lacking. Additionally, functional connectivity studies often suffer from limited sample size and a
lack of diversity. We intend to analyze the existing rsfMRI data of individuals recruited into the Health and
Aging Brain Among Latino Elders (HABLE) Study, a diverse cohort of approximately 2,000 individuals. In our
first aim, we will characterize the effect of metabolic risk (prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes status assessed by
blood glucose, diagnosis, or medication use) on functional connectivity in cognitively healthy individuals. As
part of this aim, we will also examine the role of APOE4, a foremost genetic risk factor of AD that is closely
related to cerebrovascular dysfunction. In our second aim, we will examine functional networks across the AD
diagnostic spectrum, and examine to what degree metabolic risk mediates changes in these networks. We will
then assess the relationship between cardiometabolic risk score and functional connectivity across the entire
cohort."
10910118,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our re-submission proposal, “Reducing Asthma Attacks in Disadvantaged School Children with
Asthma,” seeks broad-scale implementation of our effective school-based approach to improve asthma
disparities for children in low-income communities (ages 5 to 12 years). Using community-based participatory
methods with high risk populations and communities, we will contextualize dissemination and implementation
(D&I) of our Colorado school-based asthma program (Col-SBAP) that reduces asthma exacerbations and
missed school days, while also addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) which our pilot identified as
major drivers of asthma disparities. We will evaluate key metrics identified by diverse stakeholders during a
dissemination trial in rural and small metropolitan areas of Colorado. Our dissemination trial will include two
interventions: our evidence-based Col-SBAP and an evidence-based assessment and management approach
to key SDOH. Our pilot data show both interventions are critical to improve asthma disparities for children from
low income families. This two-step level of intervention, called Stop Asthma Attacks (SAA), will be designed for
sustainable delivery by school asthma navigators and school nurses who coordinate with primary care and
community resources. In partnership with our community stakeholders, the Exploration, Preparation,
Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) D&I framework will be applied during the UG3 planning phase to
iteratively adapt our current implementation guide to tailored implementation plans that meet local community
and site-specific needs, resources and priorities (EPIS Phases 1 & 2). We will then conduct a UH3
dissemination trial with a randomized stepped-wedge study design in asthma “hot spot” school systems across
five Colorado regions to evaluate implementation strategies across asthma “hot spot” school systems (EPIS
phase 3, UH3 trial) and to apply the work from EPIS phases 1-3 to develop a “dissemination playbook” to
guide future program adoption by other school systems (EPIS Phase 4). The central hypothesis is that SAA will
have broad and equitable Reach (primary outcome), and yield important benefits in reducing asthma attacks
and symptoms, as compared to schools that have not yet implemented SAA. The SAA playbook will be
designed to promote the sustainable adoption of SAA, including training materials and a calculation of return
on investment. Our proposal is responsive to and addresses key elements of NHLBI HL-20-003 by “testing
late-stage (T4) implementation research strategies” and “promoting and improving population health in high-
burden communities” by using a public health approach to target “hot spot” schools with high levels of
uncontrolled asthma and asthma associated burden. This proposal will both include a rigorous stakeholder
engagement process to ensure SAA is disseminated to diverse geopolitical areas of Colorado with attention to
sustainability. Collectively, this evaluation and playbook will accelerate dissemination of SAA nationally to
communities experiencing health inequities in pediatric asthma care."
10910125,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with the prevalence projected to keep
rising. The origins of CVD begin early in life, including child obesity and atherosclerotic plaque formation, which
predict later CVD. To address the origins of CVD, the American Heart Association created 2020 Impact Goals
emphasizing promotion of cardiovascular health early in life, which includes measures of both physical risk
factors (e.g., body mass index [BMI], blood pressure) and health behavior (e.g., diet). Stress in the prenatal
period is hypothesized to contribute to CVD in adulthood. However, little is known about plausible biological
mechanisms. The focus of this proposal is to assess the role of placental corticotrophin-releasing hormone
(CRH), an understudied stress responsive hormone that regulates fetal development and birth outcomes, in
offspring CVD risk (BMI z-score, waist circumference, and blood pressure) and obesogenic eating behaviors.
This project will utilize a longitudinal design to prospectively follow a sample of mother-child dyads (n = 150).
Placental CRH was assessed as a part of a NIMH-funded study (R01MH109662) through maternal blood
samples at three timepoints during pregnancy (10, 24, and 34 gestational weeks). Child CVD risk (BMI z-score,
waist circumference, and blood pressure) and obesogenic eating behaviors are being assessed as a part of a
follow-up NHLBI-funded study (R01HL155744) at a laboratory visit when the children are 3-years-old. The
current project has two aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that rapid increases in placental CRH across
gestation predict greater offspring CVD risk at three years of age; and Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that
increased placental CRH production across gestation predicts greater offspring obesogenic eating behaviors.
Identifying the associations between placental CRH across gestation and both offspring CVD risk and
obesogenic eating behaviors will elucidate early origins of cardiovascular health and provide targets for early
prevention and intervention. While conducting the proposed study, the applicant will gain essential training at the
University of Denver that strongly supports her goal of becoming an independent NIH-funded researcher. The
applicant’s goals include 1) increasing understanding of the prenatal period as a sensitive period, focusing on
prenatal stress physiology (e.g., placental CRH); 2) developing expertise in the assessment of CVD risk during
early childhood; 3) developing expertise in the assessment of eating behaviors during early childhood; 4) learning
advanced statistical modeling of longitudinal data; and 5) developing grant writing skills. The completion of these
training objectives, along with the strong mentorship from the project sponsor (Elysia Davis, PhD) and co-
mentors (Jenalee Doom, PhD, Deborah Glueck, PhD, Julie Lumeng, MD, and Benjamin Hankin, PhD), will
support this applicant’s career trajectory toward becoming an independent researcher."

Co-occurring substance use and HIV risk among people in carceral settings is a syndemic. Approximately 17%
of all incarcerated people have an opioid use disorder (OUD), and the prevalence of HIV is 3-5 times that of the
general population. Gold standard interventions exist to stem adverse OUD outcomes and prevent HIV infection:
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD, e.g., buprenorphine).
However, implementation of these efficacious interventions is underemployed in carceral settings and during
community re-entry, and even when they are put into practice, barriers to optimal uptake, adherence, and
continuation often occur. However, long-acting injectable (LAI) formulations of both PrEP and buprenorphine
have recently been approved by the FDA, providing opportunities to innovate on how these medications are
deployed. In addition, evidence in the community proves that MOUD + HIV efforts, when delivered in tandem,
improve outcomes for those with OUD, and that retention in MOUD predicts positive HIV prevention outcomes.
Therefore, we propose conducting a hybrid implementation-effectiveness type 2 study to optimize and test the
efficacy of a LAI PrEP + buprenorphine (XR-B) co-packaged intervention among people in carceral and
community re-entry settings in Ending the Epidemic Sites in Maryland and Washington, DC. Our specific aims
are: Aim 1 (R61): Develop the intervention protocol for delivery of LAI PrEP + XR-B; Aim 2 (R33): Evaluate
implementation facilitation as a strategy to support co-located LAI PrEP + XR-B in carceral and re-entry settings;
and Aim 3 (R33): Compare the effectiveness of LAI PrEP + XR-B to oral PrEP +SL-B. Our long-term goal is to
1) provide guidance on how to implement LAI interventions in these settings, 2) generate evidence relevant to
the efficacy of co-packaging LAI PrEP + XR-B to improve adherence and continuation of PrEP and
buprenorphine."
10910073,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is caused by both environmental and genetic factors, with the genetic
contribution estimated at 60-80%. Dozens of genes that increase risk for ASD have been identified, most based
on de novo mutations, but these mutations are predicted to account for only 15-20% of ASD cases. Thus, the
majority of the genetic contribution to ASD is predicted to result from common and rare inherited variation, but
few such genes have been identified. Recently, using whole genome sequencing, we reported genome wide
evidence for >60 ASD risk genes, 26 of them novel for ASD, with signals derived from inherited and de novo

necessary next step is to explore their impact on neurodevelopment and neuronal function using a model
organism. The current pace of translating genetic risk factors into phenotypes, mechanisms and therapies is
limited in part by inefficiencies with in vivo mammalian model systems, which makes them impractical for creating
and behaviorally testing large numbers of mutant lines. Here, we leverage the zebrafish, which occupies a unique
niche as a vertebrate model with features amenable to both in vivo screening and mechanistic understanding,
including ex utero development, transparency, small size, rapid development, a conserved yet relatively simple

supports the notion that it is a useful model to study the functions of genes that contribute to ASD risk. Rather
than assess ASD-risk genes one at a time, we will accelerate progress towards mechanistic understanding via
high-throughput assays and analyses. In Specific Aim 1 we will generate null mutations in the zebrafish orthologs
of 24 high confidence, novel, genome-wide significant ASD risk genes, and systematically test each mutant for
neurodevelopmental, behavioral, neuronal network, and transcriptomic phenotypes. In Specific Aim 2, we will
use transcriptomic analyses, at the whole brain and single cell levels, to integrate ASD risk genes into functional
networks, and test for convergence across genes and species, including ASD post mortem brain. We will also
test for functional associations among behavioral phenotypes that are often co-morbid in ASD, such as disrupted
sleep and social behavioral deficits. In Specific Aim 3 we will perform mechanistic studies to understand how
mutation of specific ASD-risk genes leads to phenotypes. This project will efficiently and cost-effectively create

10910872,"Background: The implementation of the VA’s Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated
Outside Networks (MISSION) Act in June of 2019 greatly expanded opportunities for Veterans to be referred
outside of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for complex cardiac procedures and surgeries. However,
the VA has been a longstanding national leader in both interventional cardiology and cardiac surgical quality of
care. Hence, increased referrals outside of the VHA may reduce the probability that Veterans undergoing
cardiac procedures receive the highest care quality and the best procedural outcomes.
Significance/Impact: With increasing numbers of Veterans now eligible under the MISSION Act to obtain
major cardiac procedures outside VA, it is critically important for Veterans, their VA providers, and VA
operational leaders to fully understand the consequences of Veterans' choices in terms of their access to care,
quality of care, outcomes of care, and health care costs. The total costs of VA's Community Care program are
substantial; it is therefore essential that VA maximizes the value from funds expended on Community Care.
Innovation: The proposed research will extend prior studies comparing VA and Community Care provision of
major cardiac procedures with a specific focus on the impact of the MISSION Act, which has the potential to
vastly expand the number of Veterans receiving care outside VA. Our research will provide novel insight into
how Veterans’ choices between VA and non-VA providers could be better informed by information about health
care quality and outcomes of care, thus enhancing the decision-making process. Our cost analysis will identify
potential opportunities where better care coordination between VA and non-VA providers could improve both
the value of care delivered by eliminating gaps in, and reducing duplication of, services.
Specific Aims: The primary objectives of this study are to: (a) quantify the changes in use of VA and non-VA
cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology services resulting from the MISSION Act, with a focus on how
access to care was affected; (b) measure the effects of MISSION Act implementation on the rates Veterans
obtain cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology care from high-quality hospitals, and compare the risk-
adjusted post-procedure outcomes among Veterans obtaining cardiac procedures in VA hospitals or via
Community Care after the MISSION Act was implemented; (c) assess the effect of MISSION Act imple-
mentation on the cost of interventional cardiology and cardiac surgical care to both the VA and to Veterans.
Methodology: This study will leverage our research team’s substantial expertise with both VA and non-VA
clinical, administrative, and cost datasets. We will combine data from VA’s cardiac surgery and interventional
cardiology national registries with health care utilization, cost, and outcomes data housed in the VA’s
Corporate Data Warehouse, as well as VA’s Community Care datasets such as the Program Integrity Tool
database. We will focus on Veterans undergoing (1) percutaneous coronary intervention, (2) coronary artery
bypass grafting, (3) surgical valvular replacement, or (4) transcatheter aortic valve replacement. These are
among the most common major cardiac procedures performed among veterans, with substantial risk of
mortality and morbidity as well as high associated health care costs. We will assess the impact of the MISSION
Act on Veterans’ access to these procedures, the quality of cardiovascular care delivered by the hospitals
performing these procedures, the outcomes of care, and the costs to both VA and to Veterans.
Implementation/Next Steps: The project's overarching goals are to demonstrate the importance of quality
and outcomes information in making choices between health systems, and to identify opportunities for VA
leadership to improve care coordination, optimize clinical outcomes, and reduce costs in the Community Care
program. Our research team will work closely with our Operational Partners in the VA's Office of Community
Care and the VA's National Surgery Office to shape the VA Community Care Program’s future operations."
10910885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, yet precision oncology
discoveries have substantially improved survival and quality of life for a subset of patients. Patients with lung
cancer with targetable oncogenic driver mutations represent an emerging population of patients living with
chronic, life-limiting cancer. Such patients struggle with uncertainty about when their cancer will progress and
how to make decisions about their personal lives and medical care. They also infrequently discuss their
prognosis and preferences for end-of-life care with their clinicians. This proposal details a five-year plan to
develop and pilot test a palliative care intervention that incorporates elements of survivorship care to address
the unmet needs of patients with oncogene-driven lung cancer. Specifically, the aims of this project are to 1)
refine a population-specific palliative care intervention informed by survivorship care for patients with
oncogene-driven lung cancer with feedback from stakeholders (N=15) and an open pilot (N=10); 2) evaluate
the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention in a randomized controlled trial compared to usual care
(N=80), and estimate the preliminary effects of the intervention on patients’ distress related to prognostic
uncertainty, self-efficacy for managing chronic disease, prognostic awareness, and discussions about goals
and values to inform future decision making.
This proposal also details the plans of the candidate, Dr. Laura Petrillo, a palliative care physician-investigator,
to gain mentorship, didactic training, and career development to facilitate her transition to research
independence. Dr. Petrillo’s long-term career goal is to become a leader in supportive care in oncology,
specializing in developing and evaluating supportive care interventions tailored to the needs of patients
receiving novel therapies. This proposal includes Dr. Petrillo’s plans for gaining expertise in 1) behavioral
intervention development; 2) approach to cancer survivorship research and practice; and 3) clinical trial design
and conduct. She will achieve this training through experiential learning leading the proposed project with
guidance from mentors Dr. Jennifer Temel and Joseph Greer, leading experts in palliative care research, and a
scientific advisory team with expertise in oncogene-driven lung cancer, behavioral psychology, palliative care
and survivorship research. She will gain additional skills through coursework in behavioral research methods,
clinical trial design and conduct, and longitudinal data analysis. This project will position Dr. Petrillo to compete
for R01-level funding and launch an independent career leading a research program at the interface of
supportive care and oncology."

Natural products from bacteria, fungi, and plants have long been a rich source of useful molecules. However,
due to their complex structures, it is difficult to screen many analogs of natural products to truly understand the
rules governing the relationship between their structure and activity. We will address this challenge by developing
machine learning methods that can functionally model the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of natural
products and aid in the design of biosynthetic pathways that can synthesize natural product analogs. Therefore,
we will develop methods both for prioritizing natural products that are most likely to be useful as therapeutics for
activity screens and for biosynthesizing natural products of interest.
Machine learning is a powerful computational technique that enables computers to make inferences from data.
There is a wealth of sequence, structure, and activity data available for biological molecules that we can use to
build machine learning models to make predictions about the behavior of biochemical systems. Even machine
learning algorithms that are not perfectly accurate can be extremely useful for drug discovery efforts. It is possible
to screen orders of magnitude more compounds using machine learning than in high-throughput screens.
Machine learning can therefore be used as an initial filter to increase hit rates in screens.
Our first project will apply machine learning to study natural product SARs. We will take two approaches, a
genetic and chemical structure approach. In the genetic approach we will validate correlations between
biosynthetic genes and natural product activity that we have previously observed and confirm that the correlation
extends to chemical substructures installed by the biosynthetic genes. In the chemical structure approach, we
will investigate the ability of graph neural networks to predict natural product properties.
Our second project will focus on developing machine learning and other computational tools for designing
biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) to biosynthesize novel natural product-like molecules. We will first focus on
Ribosomally Synthesized and Posttranslationally modified Peptides (RiPPs) and develop methods to predict
compatible modifying enzyme-leader peptide pairs. To do this we will use molecular modeling, Statistical
Coupling Analysis (SCA), and machine learning. After validating our methods on RiPPs, we will turn our attention
to more difficult classes of BGCs, such as nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and polyketide synthases
(PKS).
Our third project is the development of methods for designing RiPP-based protein-protein interaction (PPI)
inhibitors. We will develop both molecular modeling and machine learning methods for predicting optimal RiPP
sequences for inhibiting a PPI of interest. We will then validate and collect additional training data for these
predictions using directed evolution experiments."

The maternal fetal interface is hormonal and immunologically rich environment that is important for normal
placentation during the first trimester of pregnancy. This is also where adult diseases have developmental
origins. Both the hormonal and immunologic milieus at this stage of gestation are already sexually dimorphic.
We identified sexually dimorphic gene expression globally and among individual cell types of the first trimester
placenta impacted by signaling at the maternal fetal interface, which includes members of the TGF-β superfamily,
specifically TGFβ-1 and BMPs in males. Among individual cell types, ligands from the CCL family were most
highly representative in females whereas IL1RN and MMP9 were highly expressed in males, with their
corresponding receptors present on the maternal surface. Dihydrotestosterone, which is only produced by the
male fetus, in addition to TGFβ1 and estradiol were identified as significant upstream regulators in individual cell
types of the first trimester placenta. However, the hormonal environment may not be the only biologically sex
different factor influencing the immune system, as we have also identified key transcription regulators in early
gestation that may account for developmental origins of immune disease.
Throughout the lifespan, hormones have been implicated to play a significant role in immune dysfunction and
development of disease, as overall there is a higher prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females, such as
systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Yet men are more likely to develop
ankylosing spondylitis. Furthermore, males have increased prevalence of asthma compared to females in
childhood, but the sexually dimorphic prevalence changes post-puberty, suggesting testosterone may be
protective. There are also potential gender differences that influence the immune system. However, post
puberty, hormonal regulation becomes sexually dimorphic again and it becomes difficult to separate the
influence of hormones which is a function of biologic sex on the immune system from the influence of gender
which is due to external influences.
Therefore, in order to better understand the influence of biological sex during developmental origins of
immune function, including the effect of the hormonal milieu, we intend to identify sex specific transcriptional
regulatory signatures in the first trimester placenta. Furthermore, since sex hormones ar e not dimorphic in
early childhood, prior to puberty, we intend to better understand the influence of gender on developmental
differences of the immune system, prior to hormonal influences, to identify the critical drivers of sexual
dimorphism in immune function. Our goal is to identify sex unique regulators of immune dysfunction that can
ultimately be used as a more personalized approach to treating immunologic diseases."

10911128,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
Autophagy is a self-degradation process whereby cancer cells recycle defective organelles and macromolecules
as a nutrient source to support their increased metabolic needs. Autophagy is elevated and essential for the
tumorigenic growth of KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), providing the rationale for
clinical evaluation of the autophagy inhibitor hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for PDAC. Disappointingly, when used
as monotherapy in combination with standard of care, HCQ has shown limited to no clinical efficacy for PDAC.
We recently determined that the treatment of PDAC with inhibitors of the key KRAS effector pathway, the RAF-
MEK-ERK mitogenic activated protein kinase cascade, unexpectedly caused further elevation of autophagy,
rendering PDAC acutely dependent on autophagy, and hypersensitive to autophagy inhibition. We determined
that ERK inhibition impaired other critical metabolic processes (glycolysis, mitochondrial function) that then led
to compensatory upregulation of autophagy. Our findings, together with essentially identical conclusions by
another independent co-published study, has led to our initiation of two clinical trials evaluating two approved
MEK inhibitors (trametinib, binimetinib) in combination with HCQ for PDAC. Since our recent studies suggest
that ERK inhibitors will have superior activity in PDAC, this has prompted our initiation of a phase II clinical trial
with the ERK inhibitor LY3214996 in combination with HCQ for metastatic PDAC (Aim 1). While early
observations from compassionate care utilization of this combination support a significant clinical impact for this
combination, our preliminary studies (Aims 2 and 3) support our premise that we can improve upon this therapy.
Aim 2 studies are based on our application of a 2,500-gene druggable genome CRISPR-Cas9 genetic-loss-of-
function screen to identify genes that modulate HCQ anti-tumor activity. The identified hits that either enhance
or reduce HCQ growth inhibitor activity represent candidate combinations or biomarkers for HCQ resistance,
respectively. The biomarkers for response can then be applied to tumor biopsies collected in the Aim 1 clinical
trial evaluation. Aim 3 studies involve our application of a chemical library screen using a 525-oncology drug set
to identify combinations that enhance the cytotoxicity of HCQ. Together, combinations that arise from Aims 2
and 3 studies will then be advanced to Aim 4 studies, where we will apply PDAC organoid or orthotopic mouse
tumor models to identify combinations for future clinical evaluation. Since we have found that ERK MAPK
inhibition causes tumor-associated gene expression changes that can lead to an improved anti-tumor immune
response, we will also evaluate the impact of our combinations on tumor cytokine expression and on tumor-
associated immune cells. In summary, our studies will develop novel combination therapies to target autophagy
for the treatment of KRAS-mutant PDAC."
10911131,"PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
Remarkable clinical responses have been reported in B-cell malignancies by adoptive transfer of T cells
redirected with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for the CD19 antigen. However, developing CAR-Ts
for the treatment of solid tumors including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is challenging because:
(1) PDAC-associated antigens that are targetable by CAR-Ts are limited, generally not exclusively expressed
by PDAC, and act as passengers, not as drivers of tumorigenesis, allowing for antigenic drift; (2) CAR-Ts are
defective in their capacity to invade stroma-rich tumors such as PDAC; (3) PDAC tumor microenvironment
(TME) is highly immunosuppressive. In this proposal we aim at solving these critical issues. We have identified
B7-H3 (CD276) as a suitable target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in PDAC. B7-H3 is a tumor-
promoting transmembrane protein aberrantly expressed in 60% to 93% of PDAC, melanoma, leukemia, breast,
prostate and ovarian cancer, while limited expression is seen on normal healthy tissues. We have developed
and tested B7-H3.CAR-Ts in xenogeneic and immunocompetent mouse models of PDAC showing antitumor
activity and safety. Thus in Aim 1 we propose to develop a phase I clinical study in patients with PDAC to
assess safety and antitumor activity of B7-H3.CAR-Ts that also include the inducible caspase9 (iC9) as a
safety switch to terminate the activity of B7-H3.CAR-Ts in case of toxicity. In Aim 2 we propose to develop in
preclinical models CAR-Ts in which T cells are not be only rendered tumor specific through the CAR
expression, but are also equipped to overcome the desmoplastic nature of PDAC. Specifically, B7-H3.CAR-Ts
will be further engineered to re-express the enzyme heparanase (HPSE), which is defective in CAR-Ts
generated for clinical use. Furthermore, we will explore if the glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa (gp96 or
Grp94), which is a member of the heat shock protein (HSP) 90 family (HSP90B1) can also be used as
additional target in PDAC to prevent tumor escape due to antigen loss when one single antigen is targeted. In
Aim 3 we propose to reprogram macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to a non-
immunosuppressive state by using potent and orally bioavailable TAM RTK small molecule inhibitors
developed at University of North Carolina (IND #128236). We will thus perform preclinical studies to evaluate
whether TAM RTK signaling inhibition in macrophages and MDSC would favor the antitumor activity of B7-
H3.CAR-Ts. If successful, this strategy will be included into a second phase of the proposed Phase I clinical
study with B7-H3.CAR-Ts."
10909608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As modern human expanded worldwide, they settled in different environments that subjected them
to selective pressure, driving genetic adaptations to varied local conditions. The origin of modern
adaptive variants is intricately intertwined with population history and local adaptations that shaped
the phenotypic diversity among human population today including health related traits. The
investigation of the functions of adaptive genetic variants provides important insights into the
mechanisms of human evolution and facilitate the identification of complex disease genes.
Nonetheless, current strategies for establishing connections between genetic variants and functions
face several limitations and new approach are needed. This proposal describes my plan to use
ancient human DNA to explore the origin of adaptive variants and the strength of selection that has
influenced their occurrences over time. Up to now, the use of ancient DNA (aDNA) to investigate
adaptation events was challenged by the scarcity of human fossils. To overcome this barrier, I
leverage on a new approach, I and others pioneered, to retrieve human aDNA from archaeological
sediment independent of skeletal remains. This breakthrough technology allows us to generate
genomic time-series data at a previously unachievable scale in any locations where human have
once lived. I will apply this innovative approach to investigate the evolution of recent human
phenotypes in East Asia. I propose to extract aDNA from a collection of sediment samples from the
Tsagaan Agui cave, an archaeological site in Mongolia with evidence of ancient human occupation
spanning the last 500,000 years. Mongolia, with its rich archaeological records is an ideal location
not only to retrieve aDNA from modern humans but also from now-extinct archaic humans that once
thrived in the region and were adapted to local environmental conditions hundreds of thousands of
years before the arrival of modern human. I will use target sequencing to infer the ancestry of past
individuals that occupied the site and genotype them across thousands of adaptive loci. By
combining these data to the archaeological and past ecological records of the region, I will
contextualize the emergence of specific adaptive variants in both archaic and modern humans. This
project will significantly enhance our understanding of past environmental conditions that contributed
to the acquisition of specific adaptive variants in modern human populations and holds the promise
of addressing fundamental queries about our evolutionary history by defining the genetic basis of
human adaptation to local environments, diets, and modern diseases."
10911910,"The brain’s transport system for cerebrospinal and interstitial
fluid, the glymphatic system, was first described in 2012 by the Nedergaard team, operates primarily
during sleep, and has been linked to pathological neurological conditions including Alzheimer’s disease,
traumatic brain injury (TBI), and stroke. Obtaining quantitative measurements of glymphatic fluid velocity
and pressure is crucial to understanding the function, failures, and potential rehabilitation of the
glymphatic system. However, existing techniques for obtaining in vivo glymphatic velocities are limited to
sparse measurements and specific regions, and pressure variation is essentially impossible to measure
in vivo. We propose to quantify glymphatic flows from measurements of tracked particles and contrast
agents using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which can infer velocity and pressure from
sparse measurements and have not been used previously in neuroscience. We will adapt PINNs for
three commonly-employed glymphatic imaging modalities: two-photon perivascular space imaging,
transcranial whole-brain imaging, and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCEMRI).
For these modalities, each of which can probe different regions and scales of glymphatic flows, we
will adapt the PINNs equations and artificial intelligence hyperparameters, evaluate the sensitivity of the
approach to noise, spatiotemporal resolution, and imaging artifacts using synthetic data, and validate by
comparing velocities inferred by PINNs to velocities from alternative techniques. Using PINNs will allow
us to obtain in vivo velocity and pressure measurements of cerebrospinal fluid in previously unmeasured
regions of the brain. Our collaborative team of neuroscientists, fluid dynamicists, and applied
mathematicians includes the leaders who discovered the glymphatic system and invented PINNs.
Moreover, we have extensive experience with all three imaging modalities and with velocity
measurement (via automated particle tracking and front tracking) in glymphatic flows.
This proposal seeks to reveal mechanisms by which the brain's transport system for cerebrospinal and
interstitial fluid operates. Our novel velocity and pressure measurements of intracranial cerebral spinal
fluid flows may demonstrate how improving sleep, the state during which the glymphatic system
primarily operates, can counteract pathological processes related to glymphatic system failure including
Alzheimer's disease."
10911912,"Summary/Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer with dismal survival for
patients with unresectable disease. Recent approval for PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab (atezo) and VEGF
inhibitor bevacizumab (bev) in frontline treatment is a landmark advance; however further improvement is
needed with a median progression free survival of less than 7 months. We have found through a multi-center
cooperative study that tumor transcriptome signature high in interferon-gamma and MHC-II signaling (INFAP
signature) is correlated with increased response and survival to PD-1 inhibitor. We propose to add high dose
external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by intra-tumor injection of autologous dendritic cells (DC) to
atezo/bev to further enhance the immune stimulatory effect. Radiation can induce inflammatory tumor cell
death that can be favorable for tumor neoantigen presentation. Injection of autologous DC after EBRT would
be a novel method of boosting in vivo tumor antigen uptake and presentation to expand tumor-reactive
cytotoxic T cells. We have treated subjects with unresectable liver tumors (HCC and cholangiocarcinoma) in a
pilot study with this EBRT and DC approach with promising response and acceptable toxicity (no grade ≥3
toxicity). Three of the five subjects had partial response, including a patient with ongoing response beyond 1
year. Both emergence of new TCR clones and expansion of existing TCR clones, including clones with tumor
reactive and cytotoxic profile, have been observed, suggesting this combination could enhance tumor reactive
cytotoxic T cell response. However, many of the TCR clones also have early exhaustion signal with
upregulation of multiple checkpoint receptors. Thus, combining DC injection with atezo/bev may help further
enhance the cytotoxic functions of these TCR clones. We hypothesize that combining EBRT followed by
intratumor DC injections with atezolizumab and bevacizumab can improve the PFS for patients with
unresectable HCC and that the effect is mediated by systemic expansion of a tumor reactive T cell repertoire.
We will test the hypothesis through 2 aims. 1) Assess the clinical efficacy of this combination therapy in a
phase II study with a safety run-in phase. Increased PFS rate at 1 year will be the primary endpoint. 2)
identify the effect of this novel combination immunotherapy on tumor reactive T cell repertoire. We will
use scRNAseq and TCRseq to identify TCR clonal expansion and transcriptome profile of the TCR clones in
the blood and tumor, with a focus on tumor reactive TCR clones. We will also use scRNAseq and flow to profile
the changes of other immune cells in the tumor and blood, with a focus on the changes in expression of the
INFAP signature. Finally, we will use imaging cytometry to examine the tumor and immune spatial relationship
in the tumor. Our study will not only identify the clinical activities of this novel combination therapy but also use
state-of-the-art technology to improve our understanding on the mechanism of action to this immunotherapy."
10918000,"SUMMARY: Acquired tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) occurs when the internal supporting infrastructure of the
trachea and bronchi break down, causing the airway to collapse on itself. TBM is progressive in nature and can
lead to ventilator dependency and even death. Since TBM is a purely structural issue in the trachea and bronchi,
pharmaceutical interventions have little to no effect. Previously, the only solution was a highly invasive open
tracheobronchoplasty that resulted in high morbidity, a long recovery period, and high mortality, limiting its via-
bility for broad patient treatment. Dr. Richard Lazzaro pioneered the first minimally invasive robotic TBM repair
(R-TBP), a procedural innovation that opened a surgical option for people who would not have previously been
surgical candidates. However, today, only the most skilled surgical hands can do the portion of the surgery that
is extremely technical. The complexity entails custom fabricating square surgical mesh into geometries that con-
form and anatomically reconstruct the patient’s trachea and bronchi. Though a mainstream, minimally invasive,
robotically assisted procedure was successfully created, a commercially viable scaffold system designed for
TBM repair is needed to enable mainstream thoracic surgeons to easily and safely perform this surgery. Lazzaro
Medical has developed a patented scaffold system designed to be easily sutured onto the posterior external
trachea and bronchi to help recreate a more anatomically correct airway. The LM Scaffold System™ is comprised
of one tracheal scaffold and two bronchial scaffolds specially designed and optimized to reinforce the soft tissue
of the airway. As part of an overall go-to-market plan, additional preclinical studies are planned as follows: Aim
1. Method development and validation. We will partner with Inotiv to develop and validate an appropriate in
vivo TBM methodology. Tasks include (1.1) replication of ex vivo TBM model in canine cadavers; (1.2) acute
feasibility of mesh application to healthy tracheas in live dogs. Aim 2. Product development, verification, and
validation of the LM Scaffold SystemTM. We will advance development of the LM Scaffold prototype in parallel
with method development and validation activities in Aim 1. Tasks include (2.1) benchtop verification of device
specifications throughout iterations in accordance with FDA guidelines; and (2.2) iterative prototype development
throughout the method development and validation process. Aim 3. Evaluation of pivotal preclinical efficacy
and safety in a TBM ovine model. We will partner with Inotiv to establish IDE-enabling in vivo efficacy and
safety using a TBM canine model. Tasks include (3.1) in vivo chronic non-GLP evaluation of feasibility using a
control arm, induced arm with no treatment, and induced arm with LM Scaffold SystemTM treatment; and (3.2)
GLP chronic 30, 90, and 180 day safety study. Next Steps. Upon completion of IDE-enabling studies, we will
have sufficient data for submission and approval to start first in human trials of the LM Scaffold System™."

The ANCHOR Study is an ongoing, longitudinal, multicenter trial in people living with HIV
(PLWH), which demonstrated that treating anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(HSIL, or precancer) prevents progression to anal cancer, as compared to active monitoring
(six-monthly high-resolution anoscopy exams with biopsies and cytology). This trial was a
unique opportunity to conduct a randomized study comparing monitoring to treatment, the utility
of which had not yet been established as effective and therefore not considered standard care.
As part of the trial, we collected serial samples to establish a biobank, and therefore a unique
opportunity to conduct comparisons in participants who did and did not progress to cancer. Our
aims with this supplement are to initiate the trial’s correlative science objectives to inform HSIL
screening algorithms for secondary prevention of anal cancer, optimize use of HRA and HSIL
treatment resources by identifying biomarkers of HSIL regression, and explore the molecular
pathogenesis of progression from HSIL to anal cancer. Findings from this research, among
other assays, are intended to inform optimal screening and treatment strategies for anal cancer
prevention in PLWH and potentially other groups."
10918746,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Restoring the integrity of the gastrointestinal tract could be key to counteracting the spectrum of inflammation-
associated debilitating illnesses and increased mortality among persons living with HIV-1 (PWH) on antiretroviral
therapy. This may be accomplished by harnessing pathways that maintain gut homeostasis, of which IgA-
microbiome interactions are emerging as fundamental mechanisms. In fact, using gut biopsies from an age/sex-
matched cohort of PWH and HIV-1-uninfected individuals, we demonstrated alterations in the IgA repertoire
among PWH that associated with specific bacterial taxa. Testing these IgA-microbiome correlations
experimentally is a major challenge, as the human antibody repertoire is extremely diverse, with over a trillion
distinct antibodies possible. Interestingly, recent high-throughput studies revealed the existence of 'public'
antibodies: clonotypes that were shared among unlinked individuals that encode the same V and J genes and
highly related CDR3 antigen-binding regions. The biology of public antibodies remains mysterious; statistically,
these antibodies should not exist unless there is a shared antigenic history and/or evolutionarily-conserved
function. Notably, in inbred, specific-pathogen-free mice, a subset of public IgA interacted with the gut
microbiome, suggesting a potential role in gut homeostasis. To date, whether these findings extend to humans
remains unclear. Using our next-generation sequencing dataset, we uncovered over a dozen public IgA
clonotypes specific to PWH versus HIV-1-uninfected controls, and vice versa. As a critical first step in
understanding their biology, our main goal in this exploratory study is to prepare recombinant public IgA
clonotypes specific to HIV-1-uninfected individuals or PWH, and interrogate their reactivity against fecal bacterial
communities and microbial glycans. We will then test if bacteria-reactive public IgA recovered from PWH gut
biopsies influence HIV-1-mediated CD4+ T cell death and inflammation in a robust ex vivo Lamina Propria
Aggregate Culture model that we developed previously. These studies promise to provide the field with a first
look at the nature and immune properties of public IgA clonotypes in the human gastrointestinal tract, that may
provide promising leads for therapeutic modulation of mucosal inflammation in chronic HIV-1 infection and a
wide variety of medical conditions associated with a 'leaky gut' syndrome."

(B virus) and an SPF Level 2 colony free of three additional viruses including rhesus cytomegalovirus
(RhCMV), simian foamy virus (SFV), and rhesus rhadinovirus (RRV). This application will expand the
percentage of SPF Level 2 rhesus while maintaining the current overall colony size. We will continue pedigree
determination for all colony animals and characterize the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I
(Mamu-A and -B) and Class II (Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci in our breeding SPF rhesus
macaques. This application will continue to collect fecal microbiome and peripheral blood lymphoid cells as a
biorepository for use by HIV/AIDS investigators. The four principal goals of this application are:
Continue to expand the SPF Level 2 population relative to Level 1 while maintaining overall colony size.
Develop improved and expanded screening and confirmatory tests for the detection of SPF agents to facilitate
the maintenance of the SPF colony. We will initiate annual surveillance for Trypanosoma cruzi in recognition of
the expansion of the geographic range of this parasitic infection. This work includes new assays for agents
such as tuberculosis, which represents the first SPF agent.
Maintain genetic analysis to determine the pedigree of Indian rhesus born into the colony and test all adult
breeders to characterize their Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Class I (Mamu-A and -B) and Class II
(Mamu-DRB, -DQA, -DQB, -DPA, and -DPB) loci.

SUMMARY
The CCMI Outreach Core will use a multifaceted approach to promote the use of systems biology in cancer 
research and clinical translation. We will also devote significant efforts to educating the general public, from 
children to adults and including patients and patients’ families. The result will be a motivated community of cancer 
systems biology researchers, an enthusiastic next generation of scientists and clinicians, and a more informed 
general public open to supporting further systems biology research. First, to build and enrich a strong and diverse 
community of cancer systems biology researchers in the Bay Area and San Diego, the CCMI v2.0 will play a 
major role in recruiting new faculty and training junior scientists at UCSF, Stanford and UCSD. We have and will 
continue to work closely with our institutional leadership to recruit new faculty members with expertise in cancer 
systems biology, several of whom are integral to the present proposal. We will draw on significant matched 
institutional support at both UCSF and UCSD to continue what is now a 5-year-long program of Cancer Systems 
Biology Trainees. This program has enabled us to recruit and support top graduate students and postdoctoral 
fellows at both UCSF and UCSD. Second, to provide a broad portfolio of educational opportunities in cancer 
systems biology, we will organize workshops to provide hands-on, expert advice for learning and applying 
bioinformatics tools and systems biology techniques to cancer research. These events will leverage the 
operational know-how built and refined in CCMI v1.0, during which we organized 7 symposia and 20 workshops 
and tutorials. Third, in recognition of the vital role that the scientific community plays in educating lay people and 
influencing public opinion, the CCMI will support a wide array of public outreach activities. These activities will 
leverage the strong partnerships we have established with organizations and events of proven track record. 
These include science festivals such as the Bay Area Science Festival and the San Diego Festival for Science 
and Engineering, as well as the “Taste for the Cure: A Taste of Science” yearly event which offers educational 
opportunities to cancer patients. These events will both educate the public and provide members of the CCMI 
opportunities to share their enthusiasm for science and medicine. Finally, to disseminate information describing 
our research and training activities, we have built and will continue to maintain a dedicated CCMI web portal. 
Visitors to the site will be provided with up-to-date information about the major research projects, links to sites 
for downloading primary data sets and bioinformatics tools, and online forms to register for CCMI events. In 
addition, we have partnered with the Quantitative Biosciences Institute (QBI) Media & Events team at UCSF to 
produce content and organize events for researchers and lay audiences."

CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM 
THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE of the Career Advancement Program will be: to increase the breadth and depth of 
the ovarian cancer translational investigator pool at the DF/HCC and across the US. We expect to train 
individuals who will become 2025’s National / International leaders in the pathobiology, diagnosis, treatment 
and control of Ovarian Cancers. The program will be led by Dr. David Spriggs, one of the overall SPORE PI’s 
and with the ongoing advice and consultation of Drs D’Andrea and Dr. Steve Cannistra. Dr. Spriggs has a long 
track record of successful recruiting and mentoring new academic investigators into new drug development 
and ovarian cancer treatment. The Specific aims will define the Career Enhancement Program: Aim 1. 
Identify appropriate candidates, primarily junior faculty members seeking to become independent investigators 
in ovarian cancer research, provide and secure funding for these investigators, and assure SPORE resources 
for awardees. This group will include applicants from the rich DFHCC pool of fellows and junior faculty as well 
as candidates from the other New England Institutions, Collaborating SPORE’s and national candidates 
solicited from AACR and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. We are particularly committed to increase the 
diversity of the peer reviewed translational science investigators in ovarian cancer. Selection will rely on the 
entire SPORE leadership and be confirmed by the EAB. Aim 2. Promote a mentoring environment and plan 
that will assist the career enhancement and success of the CEP awardees. Through the environment in the 
DF/HCC, we will create individualized training programs (IDP’s)for every funded junior faculty person and build 
a team of scientific, clinical and personal mentors around each one; Aim 3. Monitor the scientific and 
academic progress of the awardees and the program. Particular attention will be given transition points, such 
as the instructor/assistant professor interface and the attainment of RO1 equivalent funding which will mark 
transition to full independence. Short term outcome measures will include publication of high impact papers 
and the submission of extramural peer reviewed funding. Long term outcomes will be persistence in ovarian 
cancer translational research as measured by continuing peer reviewed publication in ovarian cancer research 
and achievement of senior faculty status at academic institutions 5-7 years after completion of the CEP 
completion. The majority of support will come from a variety of institutional sources from the DFHCC, the 
DFCI, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the MGH. Specific plans for the identification, recruitment 
and mentoring of a diverse awardee pool will incorporate resources for specific gender and minority

10922608,"Diet-related disparities are attributed to factors experienced by historically disadvantaged communities, such
as inadequate access to healthy food and socio-economic stressors. Poor quality diets have contributed to
high rates of chronic disease, with nearly 50% of adults suffering from diet-related chronic diseases such as
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Racial and ethnic minorities carry a disproportionate
burden of nutrition-related illness, leading to significant health disparities. Health care systems and public
health professionals are embracing Food is Medicine (FIM), including medically tailored meals (MTM) as an
evidence-based approach to reducing chronic disease risk and health care costs. Recent studies have
demonstrated improvements in dietary quality, food security, and the management of diet-sensitive health
conditions among high-risk patients who have been provided with MTMs. However, little research has been
done on understanding the most effective approaches to reducing health disparities through these programs.
Equiti Foods developed Good Bowls as healthy, affordable, good-tasting frozen meals that are convenient,
locally sourced / produced, and culturally conscious. Our mission is to decrease health disparities by
increasing the availability and consumption of nutritious food in high-need communities while providing
economic opportunities for local farms and small businesses. Expanding on our existing Good Bowls
approach, we propose to implement a “Food is Medicine” (FIM) program that will tap into existing
reimbursement initiatives to bring medically tailored meals to underserved groups at low or no cost in an effort
to reduce health disparities. Proposed Specific Aims are to: Aim 1: Form two advisory committees composed
of 1) Leaders in Food is Medicine (FIM) Programs, Medicaid waiver programs, and private payer entities who
are exploring or promoting FIM interventions including medically tailored meals (MTM) designed to address
health disparities; 2) service providers and clients of FIM and MTM programs with relevant lived experience.
Aim 2: Expand Equiti Foods’ capacity to produce culturally and medically tailored Good Bowls and family
meals through 1) developing new family/child friendly recipes and testing acceptability among current and
potential recipients; 2) creating and testing new production models including caterers and rural communitybased commercial kitchens; and 3) building out Equiti Foods’ web platform to link individuals and organizations
with a means to acquire healthy, affordable food and while also providing recipes/educational resources; and
Aim 3: Use implementation science methods to test feasibility and acceptability of these approaches, and the
business case for implementing a FIM program and MTM approach through these programs. This will inform
future scale up and revenue generation."
10931253,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Approximately one third of patients are drug-
resistant, underscoring the need for alternative therapies. One of the biggest challenges in developing disease-
modifying therapies is the limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind the initiation and
propagation of seizures. We propose to develop a novel, translational viral vector that targets dentate gyrus (DG)
granule cells, which have been shown to act as a seizure gate. We will make use of a promoter specific to DG
granule cells, Prospero-related homeobox 1 (Prox-1), to selectively express a calcium indicator in these cells.
We expect that the project will provide an invaluable tool to study behaviors of the seizure gate of DG granule
cell. We will first develop the viral vector in the US lab (Aim 1). We will then examine activity of DG granule cells
through fiber photometry in freely behaving mice during spontaneously recurring seizures in the
intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) model of temporal lobe epilepsy in Japan lab (Aim 2). We believe that this
project can help us better understand the mechanisms at play during seizures, as well as improve treatment in
patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. In addition to its utility in epilepsy, a Prox1-driven expression vector could
have potential applications in Alzheimer’s disease and neuropsychiatric disorders as well as in lymphatic and
cancer research.
This international collaboration is a unique combination of the expertise of the two groups, namely development
of molecular tools and applications of such new technologies in an animal model of epilepsy. This effort will
significantly enhance the goals of the parent R21 award."
10930839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain affects approximately 20% of both adults and children in the US and is a source of substantial
disability and health care costs. Chronic pain can be challenging to diagnose due to the presence of poorly
understood symptoms. When diagnosed, current pharmacologic treatments for pain are remarkably
ineffective, while effective non-pharmacologic treatments remain under-utilized. These shortcomings in the
diagnosis and treatment of pain arise from tremendous gaps in our knowledge about the basic central nervous
system systems that process nociceptive information and instantiate an experience of pain. These gaps are
further amplified in the case of pediatric chronic pain due to a lack of basic/translational research. Our team of
basic scientists and clinician scientists is uniquely positioned to perform human pediatric studies integrating
functional neuroimaging with quantitative sensory testing and psychological assessments to delineate brain
systems engaged during chronic pain. We will examine four distinct chronic pain syndromes: migraine,
complex regional pain syndrome, functional abdominal pain, and musculoskeletal pain. We seek to 1) Identify
shared and distinct brain systems engaged by different forms of pediatric chronic pain, 2) Determine if
predictors of recovery differ across different chronic pain conditions, 3) Delineate brain systems associated
with the spread of pain. We will follow patients longitudinally for 1 year after initiation of treatment to assess the
degree of recovery and spread of pain. This study will provide a critical foundation of basic knowledge for
future clinical trials of diagnostic markers for different forms of chronic pain and for the development of new
treatments for chronic pain."

Childhood obesity continues to be a serious public health issue in the United States (US), with disproportionate
rates among low-income, minority children. Effective, yet engaging interventions need to be designed to
capture the attention of children and their parents/caregivers living in a multi-media environment. Our work
demonstrates the novelty, appeal, and effect of multi-modal narratives in the form of comics, which convey
messages in graphics and minimal language, as a format to deliver health messages to the younger
populations. Additionally, interventions delivered on web-based/mHealth platforms can be engaging and
scalable to support health behavior change in families and also enhance and extend the impact of clinic visits
by providing online resources that reinforce health messages delivered in-person by healthcare providers. In
collaboration with our community partner, Children’s Aid (one of the oldest and largest US child welfare
organizations), an AHRQ-funded R21 study supported development and pilot testing of Intervention INC, a
family-centered, interactive, web-based health promotion tool focused on reducing childhood obesity risk. The
tool is tailored to meet the needs and preferences of low-income, black/African-American (AA) and Latino
children ages 9 to 12 and their parents/caregivers. Results of a pilot feasibility study were highly promising as
not only was the tool feasible to deliver and acceptable to our child and parent populations, children receiving
the comic tool demonstrated greater improvements (p<0.05) in vegetable, water, and sugar intake compared to
the control group, from pre- to post-intervention. However, knowledge gaps regarding tool effectiveness and
implementation in real world settings still exist. To fill these gaps, we propose a study with the following aims.
In Aim 1, formative research will be conducted with healthcare practitioners/administrators and child-parent
dyads to identify organizational (clinic) and family characteristics relevant to implementing such a tool in a clinic
setting, while in Aim 2, the tool will be adapted (based on Aim 1 findings) and usability testing of it will be
conducted. In Aim 3, a full-scale RCT will be conducted in Children’s Aid community clinics, to test the effect of
the adapted and extended tool, which will comprise a 12-week comic intervention and a 6-month maintenance
intervention, on child BMI z-score. In Aim 4, contextual factors at the clinic-, provider-, and family-level that
influence tool implementation will be explored. We believe that this family-centered web-based tool is unique
given its focus on innovative communication approaches and mHealth platform to enhance accessibility and
engagement with an often hard to reach, diverse population. It also has strong"

This SBIR Direct to Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support
algorithm for screening and detecting pulmonary hypertension (PH) using phonocardiogram and
electrocardiogram data recording using the Eko DUO Digital Stethoscopes. The screening tool
will help to decrease the number of patients with pulmonary hypertension that remain
undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. The gold standard diagnostic for
pulmonary hypertension is right heart catheterization which is costly, invasive, and requires
specialized personnel.To address these challenges, Eko developed the DUO, a digital
stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. The DUO is
designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms and electrocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet
or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we
developed as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are : (1) build a database of
matched ECG/PCG recording labeled against right heart catheterization and echocardiograms,
and (2) develop and clinically test a deep learning algorithm that can detect PH and stratify its
severity. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software
platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for pulmonary
hypertension in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes."
10930934,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide with significant
disparities in prevalence, incidence, and progression depending on gender, race, and socio-economic
status. OAG risk increases with age and presents not only an increasing economic burden on health care
systems, but also a challenge in ensuring fair and equitable treatment approaches. Unfortunately, poor
understanding of OAG risk factors has constrained currently approved treatments to intraocular pressure
(IOP) reduction. Other factors such as vascular health, specifically blood pressure (BP), are known to alter
risk of OAG onset and progression. BP and IOP vary by person, with both high and low BP being
associated with the disease process. Thus, quantifying the relative contribution of BP as a risk factor in
combination with IOP for a given individual inclusive of other demographic disparity factors will produce a
translational framework to advance glaucoma management.
The main goal of this project is to develop an innovative method for interpreting weighted contributions of
IOP and BP, along with other risk factors such as age, gender and race. A significant outcome of this
research will be a framework to assist clinicians in directing care to those who need it the most while
preventing unnecessary treatments for those at lowest risk. The proposed method consists in: (i)
developing a fast and accurate emulator for estimating the physiological status of a person's eye based
on individual-specific values of BP and IOP (Smart Eye Emulator, SEE; Aim 1); (ii) developing a method
for Transfer Learning of patient clusters across diverse and heterogeneous datasets that leverages the
physiological-enhanced variables provided by SEE (physiology-enhanced data analytics; Aim 2); and (iii)
ensuring relevance of the project outcomes by incorporating dynamically the feedback of end-users on the
perceived usability and usefulness of the proposed approach in clinical practice (Aim 3). Our team
includes experts in ophthalmology, mathematics, statistics, computer science, and health communication
science who collaboratively are providing diverse multi-center datasets from multiple countries and
continents.
Ultimately, the outcomes of this project will provide new methods to quantify the relative weight of IOP and
BP in the disease process of each individual and will identify characteristics that put people at-risk for"
10925168,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over the last 30 years, a new field––known as computational epidemiology (comp epi)––has emerged at the
intersection of digital data streams (e.g., news and social media, search query, and mobility data), machine
learning (e.g., nonlinear optimization, natural language processing, and agent-based modeling), and public
health crises. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g.,
measles) that have re-emerged in the United States due to vaccine hesitancy, comp epi has shifted part of its
focus as a field to improving public health decision-making during outbreaks and epidemics of vaccine-
preventable disease. In this proposal, we present four foundational challenges within the context of vaccine-
preventable disease research and comp epi more broadly. While the first three of these challenges are more
conventionally scientific in nature, the fourth involves scientific community-building: (1) estimating the time-
varying transmissibility (i.e., the effective reproduction number, REff) of a given vaccine-preventable infectious
disease; (2) real-time monitoring and measurement of health behaviors that impact disease transmissibility
(e.g., vaccine hesitancy, mobility, etc.); (3) forecasting of vaccine-preventable outbreaks and epidemics as a
function of individual health behaviors; and (4) recruitment of new scholars to the yet-insular field of comp epi.
To address these challenges, we propose the development of (1) a meta-analytical tool for ensemble
estimation of REff across multiple research groups; (2) a surveillance system to monitor vaccine hesitancy and
an inference system to produce more representative measures for human mobility; (3) a generalizable agent-
based model for epidemic forecasting that features behavioral parameters, as informed by the aforementioned
surveillance and inference systems; and (4) a cross-institutional virtual laboratory for comp epi scholars to
collaborate on vaccine-preventable disease research all around the world. By addressing the first three
challenges, we hope to help clinicians and public health policymakers make data-informed decisions during
vaccine-preventable crises while simultaneously providing opportunities for other public health researchers to
augment their own efforts in transmissibility estimation and epidemic forecasting by harnessing expected
products from our proposed research. Meanwhile, by addressing the fourth challenge, we hope to help new
scholars–-particularly those from under-represented backgrounds––form meaningful collaborations both with
pioneers in comp epi and with each other, while simultaneously promoting growth and diversification of the
field as we move forward."
10921837,"Humans are inherently social and form meaningful relationships with family members and friends. However,
developing these relationships is difficult for Veterans with schizophrenia (SCZ), resulting in poor social
functioning and social disability. Two components of social disability are particularly devastating: objective
social disconnection (i.e., the number of social connections) and loneliness (i.e., the subjective discomfort of
feeling alone). Social disconnection and loneliness contribute to numerous detrimental outcomes, including
early mortality. Current evidence-based treatments are not sufficiently effective at improving social
disconnection and loneliness. Understanding how these constructs operate within naturalistic environments is
vital to generating novel treatments. However, social disability in SCZ has traditionally been assessed using
clinician-rated interviews, which have limited specificity in understanding the complexities of real-world
behavior. One goal of this proposal is to evaluate the relationship between social disconnection and loneliness
with digital phenotyping via smartphones. Digital phenotyping provides an ecologically valid assessment that
can elucidate the nature of social disability in real-time. Furthermore, it is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms
of social disconnection and loneliness that could further inform treatments. Although poor performance-based
social cognition is associated with neural activity in distinct brain regions, the extent to which neural activity
observed during social cognition paradigms relates to real-time social experiences in SCZ is unknown. Thus,
the second goal of this proposal is to examine associations between functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) during social cognitive tasks and digital phenotyping measures. Combining these methodologies can
inform us about the neurophysiological mechanisms of social disconnection and loneliness. In addition to
mechanisms at the neurophysiological level, mechanisms at the social level could also contribute to social
disability. The third goal of this proposal is to use Egocentric social network analysis (SNA) to examine
objective metrics of social networks. These metrics will provide information on how the structure and
composition of social networks impact real-time social processes. This Career Development Award (CDA-2)
aims to use an innovative, multimethod approach to examine the nature and mechanisms of social
disconnection and loneliness—two critical components of social disability. The knowledge gained from this
study could inform cutting-edge interventions for Veterans with SCZ that improve social disability at multiple
levels of analysis.
This CDA will provide the applicant, Samuel J. Abplanalp, PhD, with training in the areas of (1) social cognition
and social neuroscience of SCZ; (2) fMRI data processing and analysis; and (3) SNA methodology. The
applicant’s career goal is to become a VA-based data scientist, working to improve the social disability
experienced by Veterans with serious mental illness. The training outlined in this CDA application will lay the
groundwork for the applicant to develop an independent research program within the VA focused on applying
innovative methodologies to understand and improve social disability in SCZ. The VISN 22 Mental Illness
Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) at the VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (GLA),
and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) provides an excellent environment and infrastructure to
complete the proposed study. The primary mentor will be Michael F. Green, PhD, the Director of the VISN 22
MIRECC Treatment Unit and the VA RR&D Center on Enhancing Community Integration for Homeless
Veterans (THRIVe), and an established researcher in the field of SCZ and social cognition. The applicant will
also receive specialized training from an expert in fMRI methodology (Robert Welsh, PhD) and a renowned
scholar in SNA methodology (Mark Handcock, PhD)."
10921898,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Ménière's disease (MD), a debilitating condition characterized by episodic attacks of vertigo, affects
approximately 600,000-750,000 individuals in the United States. These attacks can greatly affect quality of life,
inhibiting MD patients from performing many daily activities and increasing the risk of injury from falls. Due to
the unclear etiology of the disease and a lack of consistently effective methods of treatment, many are left
without a long-term solution for the episodic vertigo resulting from MD, even after individualized medical and
surgical treatment. Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) is a novel technology that has shown promise in its
ability to treat vertigo and other forms of vestibular dysfunction. GVS involves the application of an electrical
current to the vestibular apparatus via non-invasive skin-contact electrodes, and it has been demonstrated to
be effective in controlling vestibular function via inducing or suppressing a perception of motion as needed. In
this proposal, Vivonics seeks to utilize its previous GVS research results to develop an effective, easy-to-use,
portable GVS device that can counteract episodes of vertigo in MD patients. A compact GVS system designed
to modulate the vestibular ocular reflex will be developed at Vivonics. The system will then be tested on healthy
subjects at the University of Michigan Health Center. Vertigo will be induced in subjects via caloric stimulation.
The GVS apparatus will be connected to the subject, and either a control (no electrical stimulation) or treatment
(electrical stimulation) condition will be applied randomly. After a recovery period, the experimental setup will
be reset, and the other GVS condition (stimulation or no stimulation) will be applied. The effects of the GVS
application on the patient's perception of motion will be measured by the presence and extent of nystagmus
and the patient's perceived motion as measured by a virtual avatar.
 The short-term effect of this study will be a demonstration of the feasibility and effectiveness of GVS in
suppressing vertigo. The long-term effect will be the development of a portable, wearable device for treating
episodic vertigo that MD patients can wear to allow them to resume their activities of daily living while reducing
the risks associated with unexpected vertigo attacks, improving their physical and mental health and overall
quality of life."
10921786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The population-level impact of HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been limited by barriers to access.
People face challenges with attending frequent clinical visits, completing laboratory monitoring, and disclosing
sexual or substance use behaviors to providers, deterring PrEP initiation and continuation. These barriers to
PrEP access and use could be alleviated by making PrEP available over the counter (OTC). If PrEP were
OTC, it could be conveniently accessed without provider visits, laboratory-based testing, or their associated
costs. People would no longer need to disclose behaviors to clinicians, easing access for all but particularly for
populations experiencing stigma in healthcare settings, such as Black men who sex with men (MSM). Home-
based HIV tests, which are available OTC and acceptable in priority populations, could be bundled with OTC
PrEP: envision self-checkout at a retail pharmacy or online with a 3-month PrEP package containing 90 pills
and an HIV test. However, for OTC PrEP to be acceptable and feasible from a clinical and regulatory
perspective, the benefits of increased access, such as reductions in HIV incidence, would need to outweigh the
potential risks of reduced monitoring, such as increases in HIV drug resistance and other adverse clinical
outcomes. Moreover, for OTC PrEP to have a meaningful impact on HIV incidence, priority populations would
need to be interested in using it and able and willing to pay for it. Oral contraceptive pills, another medication to
prevent an undesired sexual health outcome, were granted OTC status in July 2023 after years of research
and strategic partnership building, providing a roadmap for rigorous formative research on OTC PrEP. We
propose Over-the-Counter PrEP: Acceptability, Feasibility, and Potential Impact of Access without a
Prescription (OFFSCRIPT), a mixed-methods study to assess interest in OTC PrEP in priority populations,
explore key stakeholders’ perspectives on acceptability and feasibility, and project long-term effects on health
benefits and risks. In Aim 1, we will survey diverse cohorts of cisgender MSM, transgender women, and
cisgender women on interest in use of OTC PrEP, reasons for potential use or non-use, and willingness and
ability to pay. We will evaluate differences by demographics, including race and ethnicity, and by current and
prior PrEP use. In Aim 2, we will conduct focus groups to explore acceptability of OTC PrEP and facilitators
and barriers to implementation among key stakeholders, including clinicians, leaders of professional medical
organizations, public health officials, regulatory experts, drug and HIV self-test manufacturers, and community
advocates. In Aim 3, we will use mathematical modeling to project the long-term impact of the availability of
OTC PrEP on population-level outcomes, including HIV incidence, disparities, and adverse clinical events,
such as HIV drug resistance, serious renal events, hepatitis B relapse, and sexually transmitted infections. This
study will be the first to explore the acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact of OTC PrEP, which could
shift the paradigm for PrEP access in the U.S. and thus have a major impact on the HIV epidemic nationally."

“Handoffs and Transitions in Critical Care – Understanding Scalability (HATRICC-US)”
Modern care of the patient with acute cardiopulmonary failure requiring critical care support is marked by the
inadequate adoption and use of interventions with proven effectiveness. There is an urgent need to characterize
implementation strategies suitable for use in the fast-paced, high stakes environment of critical care; doing so
would generate a substantial public health impact by narrowing the evidence-to-practice performance gap for
these high-acuity patients. One such gap is caused by inconsistent adoption of standardized post-surgical
handoffs in U.S. hospitals, an intervention deemed high priority by the American Heart Association. In this project,
we use an evidence-based standardized protocol for patient care handoffs from the operating room (OR) to the
intensive care unit (ICU) as a model to study the uptake and use of complex sociotechnical interventions in acute
care. In previous work, our group demonstrated adoption, fidelity, and improvement in process outcomes in a
pilot 2-site study of OR-to-ICU handoff standardization. Our published work in this area builds on a base of more
than 65 published studies demonstrating the effectiveness of handoffs protocols on a range of outcomes relevant
to the care of patients with cardiopulmonary failure, including process, provider, and patient outcomes. The
proposed study is an extension of our work that will address critical knowledge gaps about implementation in
acute care by studying the implementation of a standardized handoff protocol in 12 adult and pediatric ICUs in
eight hospitals in five health systems. This pragmatic study is a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation
study with a dual focus on demonstrating improvements in short-term patient outcomes (composite measure of
new-onset organ failure [co-primary]; adverse postoperative events) and implementation outcomes (fidelity [co-
primary]; feasibility; acceptability; appropriateness; implementation cost; and sustainment over two years). The
study integrates implementation frameworks, theories, and models with engineering approaches to workflow
evaluation, intervention adaptation, and evaluation. Our specific aims are to: (1) elucidate handoff protocol
implementation determinants using mixed-methods on-site contextual inquiry, (2) use an engineering approach
known as participatory design to adapt the handoff protocol to each ICU and use theory-based implementation
mapping to select tailored, multifaceted, multilevel implementation strategies, (3) implement handoff protocols in
stepped wedge fashion with randomized roll-out under the leadership of site based teams, and (4) use human-
centered design to create an implementation toolkit to facilitate the dissemination and use of study findings to a
broad audience. The proximate goal of this work is to determine effective approaches to implementation for
complex sociotechnical interventions in acute care settings. The longer-term goal is to use this approach to
promote the uptake and sustained use of proven-effective interventions in the care of patients with acute
cardiopulmonary failure. This work directly addresses the stated interest of NHLBI's Center for Translation
Research and Implementation Science in mixed methods studies and those using pragmatic trial designs."
10926836,"Despite decades of effort to reduce racial cancer disparities, Black people continue to die at higher rates from
cancer than any other U.S. racial group. Because prevention is the key to the cost-effective and long-term
control of cancer, the potential for cancer genetic counseling to play a central role in reducing racial cancer
disparities is high. However, the benefits of genetic counseling are not equitable across race. The overarching
goal of this proposed research is to compare and contrast the nature of genetic counseling encounters and
patient-centered outcomes between Black and White patients in the naturalistic clinical setting. Only 2% of
genetic counselors self-identify as Black/African American, so most genetic counseling encounters with Black
patients are racially discordant. Patients in racially discordant medical interactions tend to have poorer quality
patient-provider communication and receive suboptimal clinical recommendations. One major factor that
contribute to these racial healthcare disparities is racial bias. Drawing on findings from prior research, we
hypothesize that genetic counselor providers' greater implicit racial prejudice will be associated with poorer
patient-provider communication, while providers' explicit negative racial stereotypes will be associated with
less comprehensive clinical discussion of cancer risk and genetic testing for Black (vs. White) patients. These
disparities in encounters will be further associated with poorer patient-centered outcomes. We will test our
hypotheses by addressing four specific aims: Aim 1) to compare/contrast the nature of patient-provider
communication by patient race (Black or White); Aim 2) to compare/contrast the clinical discussion content by
patient race; Aim 3) to quantify the role of each type of counselor bias in patient-provider communication (Aim
1) and clinical discussion content (Aim 2); and Aim 4) to quantify the role of patient-provider communication/
clinical discussion content with patient-centered outcomes (trust, satisfaction, therapeutic alliance,
empowerment, genetic testing uptake). These aims will be achieved through an observational study with a
convergent mixed methods research design. We will analyze recorded cancer genetic counseling encounters
both qualitatively and quantitatively, linking those data to data from pre- and post-encounter surveys and
medical chart reviews. With COVID-19, many genetic counseling encounters have moved to telehealth, and
telehealth is expected to continue to thrive beyond the pandemic. The proposed study will embrace this
unique, transitional opportunity and addresses the overarching goal in the naturalistic clinical setting through
multiple modalities (in-person, telehealth). Findings from this multi-center study will highlight specific aspects of
cancer genetic counseling encounters (patient-provider communication and clinical recommendations) that are
directly associated with patient-centered outcomes. Patient-provider communication and clinical
recommendations are modifiable factors, and they are already being taught in genetic counseling training
programs; thus, the findings can have immediate impact on genetic counseling training and practice."
10921801,"In this Phase I SBIR, Optimeos will develop an off-the-shelf, in situ CAR-Treg therapy through the
nanoparticle-mediated delivery of a CAR-FoxP3 construct to CD4+ T cells as a treatment for transplant rejection.
We envision an off-the-shelf therapy that reduces the healthcare costs and high burden of adoptive cell therapies.
Ex vivo Chimeric Antigen Receptor Regulatory T cells (CAR-Treg) are currently under development for transplant
rejection and other autoimmune diseases, building on the dramatic clinical benefits in cancer from CAR-T effector
cells. The first ex vivo CAR-Treg has now moved into the clinic in the STEADFAST trial for kidney transplant
patients. CAR-Treg cells directed against the HLA antigen could provide immune tolerance after transplantation
without global immune suppression. This will decrease the incidence or severity of transplant rejection in well-
matched transplants, and allow more transplants due to less stringent HLA matching requirements.
 We propose generation of CAR-Treg cells in situ to overcome the complex manufacturing of current
approaches. Ex vivo CAR-T cells, both regulatory and effector, require labor-intensive, weeks-long processes
starting from the patient’s own cells. These therapies can cost $400,000 or more, which will prove prohibitive for
many non-oncologic diseases. Our off-the-shelf CAR-Treg therapy will use nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA
encoding both the CAR, to induce antigen specificity, and FoxP3, to drive the regulatory phenotype. We will
employ anti-CD4 antibodies as our targeting moiety to reach the desired population after IV administration.
 Our Coated Inverse NanoCarriers (CINCs) encapsulate mRNA in a polymer/lipid hybrid structure that
minimizes inflammation and enhances targeted delivery by providing stable attachment of the targeting ligand.
The targeting capabilities of CINCs will allow us to reach peripheral, splenic, and lymphatic T cells while
minimizing non-specific liver clearance. The immune-silent CINC platform permits repeat dosing and minimizes
inflammation, a profile that will be essential for in situ CAR-Treg. Over two aims in this proposal, we will select
our lead CINC formulation and design the mRNA cargo to generate CAR-Treg cells in vivo.
 Specific Aim 1: Target CINCs to CD4+ T cells in vivo. We will select the CINC formulation that exhibits
both robust transfection of primary human T cells in vitro and high specificity in vivo. We expect to achieve 15x
enhancement in delivery to peripheral CD4+ T cells with a >3x reduction in liver delivery.
 Specific Aim 2: Create and validate mRNA constructs for CAR-Treg generation. Our mRNA
sequence design will employ a CAR for HLA-A2 with FoxP3 on the same construct to ensure antigen-specific
suppressive function. After in vitro functional validation, we expect a humanized mouse study conducted with
our lead CINC formulation to show an expression peak of 5% CAR+ cells within the CD4+ compartment.
 In Phase II, we plan to demonstrate efficacy in a skin transplant model, bringing a safe, off-the-shelf
therapy closer to addressing diseases that affect nearly 50 million Americans."

The prevalence of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women is 22% in ages 45-64 years, and up to 41% in
women over 80 years old. Synthetic polypropylene mesh slings are the current standard of care treatment, and
the market for these devices is over $400M/year. However, complications rates, including chronic pain, extrusion,
and erosion, range from 5-15%. There have been numerous class-action lawsuits against manufacturers, a
pause on SUI sling sales in the UK and New Zealand, and many patients are hesitant or unwilling to receive
these implants. Therefore, there is a strong clinical need to develop new implants to treat this debilitating and
life-altering condition in women.
CollaMedix’s patented electrochemical compaction fabrication process transforms solutions of medical-grade
bovine Type I collagen into continuous-length threads on spools that are among the densest and strongest forms
of reconstituted collagen. Collagen molecules are strictly aligned in parallel to the long axis of threads, mimicking
the native topography of ligament-like tissues. When implanted in vivo, host collagen deposited throughout
scaffolds made from these threads is also aligned, indicating that the threads act as a template, resulting in an
ordered tissue structure, not a randomly oriented scar. The collagen threads are resorbed and remodeled over
time as a strong, ligamentous tissue grows through the scaffold.
Based on this technology, CollaMedix has developed a tape-shaped, pure-collagen product for SUI treatment,
CollaSling™, composed of braided pure-collagen threads. CollaSling is implanted in the same manner as
standard SUI slings and imparts less inflammation than polypropylene over time, as shown in long-term sheep
studies. We have completed the product design and high-risk verification and validation (V&V) studies required
for FDA submission, including the full biocompatibility test suite, large animal implant study, and sterilization
method development for the CollaSling.
The aims of this study are to complete the validation work and protocol development needed to submit an
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA for the CollaSling and, once the IDE is approved, to initiate
and complete a 20-participant Phase I safety pilot clinical study. The pilot study will be conducted at three hospital
centers: Duke University Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, and MetroHealth. Women with SUI who volunteer for the
study will be implanted with CollaSlings using standard surgical techniques and followed carefully. An interim
safety analysis based on adverse event rates will be conducted at 3-months post-surgery, and all participants
will be followed for a minimum of one year to assess CollaSling safety and efficacy by comparing objective
measures of continence and patient-reported outcomes to previous studies on SUI slings.
Successful completion of this pilot, first-in-human trial of the CollaSling will allow the project to move forward to
a Phase II pivotal randomized controlled trial to assess its efficacy compared to the current standard of care."
10915920,"Title: Sleep and brain thermoregulation:
Abstract
 We have found that human hunter-gatherers sleep nearly an hour more in winter than in summer and that
less than 2% of this population exhibits signs of insomnia or sleep fragmentation, compared to 10-30% of
“industrial” populations. In contrast to hunter-gatherers, most individuals in industrial societies (and animals in
laboratories) experience a relatively constant temperature from birth to death, due to modern insulation,
heating and air conditioning. We will test the hypothesis that the attenuation or elimination of natural
environmental temperature rhythms disrupts sleep by comparing sleep at 3 months of age in rats experiencing
a 24 hour temperature rhythm from birth to 2 months, to rats experiencing a constant temperature from birth.
 Seventy years after the discovery of REM sleep, the function of this state remains unclear. Despite claims
that all mammals have REM sleep, we have found that cetaceans (whales and dolphins) do not have REM
sleep and have only unihemispheric nonREM sleep. More recently we have found that fur seals, when they are
on land, show bihemispheric nonREM sleep and REM sleep. However, when in water, where they spend about
7 months a year, they show “unihemispheric nonREM sleep” and largely cease having REM sleep, like
cetaceans. They have no significant “rebound” of REM sleep upon return to land. Brain temperature has been
found to decrease in bihemispheric nonREM and increase in REM sleep in all studied mammals. We have
proposed that REM sleep has a key role in brainstem thermoregulation and that REM sleep facilitates alert
awakening by reversing the reduced brain temperature and metabolism of bilateral nonREM sleep. REM sleep
normally occurs after nonREM sleep. The reduced brain metabolism and associated temperature reduction of
nonREM sleep are adaptive, because the brain consumes a large percentage of whole body energy at rest,
and brain energy consumption is greatly reduced in nonREM sleep. But animals, including humans, awakened
from nonREM sleep are substantially less alert than animals awakened from REM sleep. The reduced
alertness upon awakening from nonREM sleep can last more than 30 minutes in humans. Thus, it is highly
adaptive to have the brain warming to waking levels that occurs in REM sleep, which occupies its highest
percentage of sleep time prior to awakening. We propose to determine the effect of environmental temperature
on cortical and brainstem temperature. We propose to identify the brainstem sites at which temperature
manipulation affects REM sleep latency and duration. Understanding the role of REM sleep in brain
thermoregulation may be relevant to our understanding of narcolepsy, hypersomnia and insomnia."
10916683,"Project Summary: Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWH) have a two-fold
increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with the general population. While persistent
systemic inflammation and immune activation appear to predict this risk, it has been challenging to identify the
pathophysiologic pathways that can be targeted to reduce inflammation and cardiovascular risk in treated HIV
infection. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a significant role in regulating pathophysiologic pathways like
inflammation and angiogenesis, and they are implicated in key aspects of heart disease. To date, limited data
exist on the molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of EVs on atherosclerosis progression, leaving open
the question of how EVs might impact the resolution of inflammation to influence CVD risk in HIV. This
proposal is innovative in that it will employ high-throughput testing platforms for characterizing EVs and their
cargo on longitudinal samples from well-characterized cohorts of persons with HIV and CVD and will utilize a
novel mouse model of HIV atherosclerosis and cutting-edge in vitro models to identify and validate novel
inflammatory mediators carried by EVs and provide potential novel targets for intervention. In Aim 1, we will
test the hypothesis that 1) Immunologically active EVs derived from HIV+ adults on ART will carry pro-
inflammatory mediators that will be associated with carotid artery intima-media thickness progression; and 2)
EVs from HIV+ adults with higher CVD risk will carry a unique miRNA signature and will be associated with a
specific inflammatory pathway (e.g. NLRP3 inflammasome signaling/caspase-1 activation). In Aim 2, we will
develop a novel accelerated atherosclerosis mouse model associated with HIV infection to test the hypothesis
that 1) Systemic administration of EVs derived from HIV-1 Tg26/ApoE−/− mice will more strongly induce
production of proinflammatory mediators when infused into recipient mice and will transfer molecules that alter
exosomal miRNA expression in recipient cells; 2) DNA-containing EVs from HIV-1 Tg26/ApoE−/−mice will
induce epigenetic changes in recipient cells; and 3) the administration of EVs derived from VX-765 or
MCC950-treated atherosclerotic mice will produce circulating EVs that lack the ability to affect the exosomal
miRNA expression in recipient cells. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that 1) EVs from those with high CVD
risk will directly cause cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell dysfunction and promote increased cell death
compared to controls; 2) Caspase inhibitors (caspase-1/inflammasome inhibition) will mitigate apoptosis in
cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells mediated by EVs derived from those with high CVD risk; and 3) EV
signaling will be dependent on EV RNA content for delivery of a pro-inflammatory signal. We also will focus on
the development of genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify the causal variants, genes, and molecular
mechanisms on cardiac cell function. We aim to create a new paradigm for discovery of novel EV-based
interactions that can be targeted to prevent immune activation and inflammation that persists in PLWH."
10916686,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in American war Veterans. Due to limited uptake in lung cancer screening,
one third of patients present locally advanced (Stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at diagnosis, and
the overwhelming majority have unresectable disease. The addition of adjuvant immune checkpoint blockade
(ICB) to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has resulted in significant improvements in overall survival at five
years for unresectable Stage III NSCLC. Unfortunately, up to a quarter of Veterans with Stage III lung cancer
are unable to tolerate this trimodality therapy. An equal proportion of Veterans discontinue therapy secondary to
treatment progression, highlighting the need for both more effective and better tolerated treatment strategies. In
resectable NSCLC, neoadjuvant immunotherapy can induce major pathologic responses (MPR) in up to half of
patients. Neoadjuvant therapy is better tolerated in many solid malignancies including locally advanced rectal
cancer. Moreover, neoadjuvant immunotherapy more than halves the recurrence rate as compared to adjuvant
immunotherapy in locally advanced melanoma. We hypothesize that 1.) neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will
improve the progression-free survival of patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC, 2.) PET-adaptive
radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will reduce radiation field sizes and will enhance the
treatment tolerance and outcomes in Veterans with unresectable NSCLC. We will test this hypothesis in two
aims: Specific Aim 1: Conduct a multi-site single arm open label Phase II clinical trial to assess if neoadjuvant
chemoimmunotherapy followed by adaptive radiotherapy is effective in Veterans with unresectable Stage III
NSCLC. Up to thirty Veterans with unresectable Stage III NSCLC with ≥ 1% PD-L1 expression will be enrolled
across seven VAs. Three cycles of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will be given followed by PET-adaptive
radiotherapy and adjuvant nivolumab. The primary endpoint of the trial will be the median progression-free
survival. Secondary endpoints will include treatment tolerance, completion of planned courses of therapy, best
overall response rate, and overall survival. Matched controls will be drawn from a contemporaneous cohort of
Veterans with unresectable Stage III NSCLC enrolled on an observational prospective study. We anticipate that
completion of this work will identify that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy will improve patient outcomes and
treatment tolerance. Specific Aim 2: Examine whether baseline and on-treatment factors are indicative of anti-
tumor immunity and clinical benefit from chemoimmunotherapy in Veterans with unresectable Stage III NSCLC.
Preliminary data suggests that tissue immunophenotype may be predictive of benefit from ICI in the metastatic
setting. We will perform correlative exploratory analyses of tissue samples of patients enrolled in this trial to
extend these findings to Stage III NSCLC. In Aim 2A, we will perform next generation sequencing and evaluate
whether the recently validated Immune Response Score is prognostic and predictive in locally advanced NSCLC.
We will evaluate whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or radiographic responses correlate with outcomes.
Univariate and multivariate modeling will be used to improve precision oncology approaches. Completion of
these studies will identify additional tumoral biomarkers potentially predictive of the efficacy of
chemoimmunotherapy in Stage III NSCLC, guiding future clinical trials."

 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity and disproportionately affects
Black American women. Compelling evidence highlights pregnancy as an important window for identifying
future CVD risk. Although Black women are also at elevated risk for cardiovascular complications during
pregnancy, heterogeneity is poorly understood and differentiated phenotypes of CVD risk before, during and
after pregnancy are lacking. Consistent with models of racial stress, Black women are often exposed to
contextual stressors (e.g., discrimination stress, adversity, violence) over the lifespan that contribute to racial
disparities in health via alterations in stress regulation systems. Prenatal stress reactivity has been linked to
poor obstetric health and adverse birth outcomes, but the effects of on women’s cardiovascular morbidity in the
postpartum period are unclear. In response to RFA-MD-20-800 ‘Addressing Racial Disparities in Maternal
Mortality and Morbidity’, the proposed research examines individual differences in prenatal stress regulation as
a biological pathway through which early and chronic stress exposure impacts postpartum CVD risk among
Black women. The study also builds on growing evidence shows that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs) are associated with reduced stress reactivity and CVD risk, and our own work with Black women
supports their utility as a modifiable target for intervention during pregnancy. Thus, we will explore the
protective effects of prenatal PUFA levels on the association between lifetime stress and postpartum CVD risk.
 The Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS), a 20-year longitudinal study that began annual assessments of stress
exposures in childhood, provides an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate phenotypes of peripartum CVD
risk as a function of lifetime stress. We propose to recruit Black pregnant women (N = 400) from the PGS and
collect biobehavioral measures of CVD risk (i.e., lipids, blood sugar, blood pressure, adiposity, diet, smoking
and activity) and inflammatory markers at 2, 12 and 24 months postpartum. These new data will be linked to
extant PGS data on preconception and prenatal CVD biobehavioral markers, lifetime stress exposures, and
prenatal stress regulation to address the following Specific Aims among Black women: (1) Elucidate peripartum
phenotypes of CVD risk related to life stress; (2) Examine the impact of prenatal stress regulation on
postpartum CVD risk; and (3) Explore the moderating effects of prenatal PUFAs on CVD risk. The proposed
longitudinal study builds on the prior work of the multidisciplinary investigative team and will provide the first
rigorous examination of peripartum phenotypes of CVD risk among Black women. Achieving the stated aims
will inform causal models of risk and generate critical knowledge for optimizing the timing of, and novel targets
for, interventions to reduce persistent racial disparities in maternal cardiovascular morbidity."

This competing renewal of a training program is designed to prepare highly qualified postdoctoral fellows for
research leadership careers in translational lung biology and lung disease relevant research. To ensure the most
competitive program, we seek applications from MD and PhD candidates from a wide range of sources and a
wide variety of scientific, personal, racial and ethnic backgrounds emphasizing a nationwide competition. This
program has been highly successful since its inception 25 years ago, and in this renewal, we have maintained
our focus on training in fundamental areas relevant to lung injury, immunology, and repair. We did, however,
continue to adapt to the needs of pulmonary research in the second decade of the 21st century and facing forward
the 3rd decade. Specifically, we continued our efforts to augment training in investigative efforts that will foster
human and translational investigations, especially training in cutting edge approaches including genomics and
high throughput profiling technologies, bioengineering, genome editing, computational biology and
bioinformatics, epidemiology, outcomes research and implementation science with a focus on enhancing
scientific rigor and reproducibility. MD trainees may enter this program only after having completed the clinical
requirements for Board eligibility. Optimal research training is achieved by protecting the trainees' time to allow
their efforts to be dedicated to research. Training is mentor-based, interdisciplinary, and enriched by didactic
courses and by interactions with diverse faculty who are recognized experts in their fields. Mentors are chosen
based on proven ongoing quality and productivity of their research programs, significant extramural support, and
availability and commitment to serve as mentors. The mentors are amongst the leaders of Yale research and
belong to research spheres identified as important in respiratory disease processes including: Translational
Research, Genetics and Genomics, Computational Biology and Informatics, Immunology and Inflammation,
Cellular and Molecular Physiology and Biology, Pathology, Stem Cell Biology and Repair, Vascular Biology,
Host-Pathogen Interactions and Dysbiosis, Biomedical Engineering, Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Clinical
Research and Implementation Science. Because of the wide spectrum of outstanding laboratories at Yale, the
institutional nature of this proposal, and the significant growth in the research funding and productivity at the
section of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at Yale, 10 positions are requested per year. The
program will be a minimum of 2 years. Trainee progress will be carefully evaluated and productivity monitored
by each mentor, a Research Advisory Committee, and the Program Directors. The uniqueness of this program
stems from a) the truly institutional nature of this grant involving 5 Schools at Yale, 9 clinical departments and 8
basic science departments; b) the strong interactions that exist between the clinical and basic science faculty on
this program; and c) the training track record of the mentors."
10909911,"This CSR&D VA Career Development Award (CDA-2) will develop Dr. Khanh Nguyen as a
vascular surgeon-scientist trained in both basic and translational research approaches to study
vascular disease and apply discoveries to improve the care of patients. With the support of an
excellent mentorship team at the VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) and Oregon Health
& Science University (OHSU) headed by her primary mentor, Dr. Edward Neuwelt, she will study
deep vein thrombosis (DVT), where clots form in the deep veins of the body. Despite modern medical
treatment, chronic or recurrent DVT and post thrombotic syndrome (PTS), where signs and
symptoms of DVT persist or worsen causing lifelong disability. Recent clinical trials have shown that
even with the addition of catheter directed thrombolysis to standard anticoagulation therapy, PTS still
occurs. Anticoagulation treatment, primarily with warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) such
as rivaroxaban or apixaban, are inadequate to prevent PTS, although some early studies suggest that
the DOAC rivaroxaban may decrease the incidence of PTS but does not eliminate it.
 The goal of this proposal is to understand the process of inflammation and fibrosis in DVT
resolution. During DVT healing, these processes may be beneficial by directing tissue remodeling and
dissolving thrombus but may be detrimental by damaging vein walls, valves and surrounding tissues;
thereby leading PTS. Aim 1 of this proposal will examine the role of relaxin (RLX), that has anti-
inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in other vascular diseases, on the molecular, structural and
biomechanical changes of the thrombus and vein wall during DVT resolution using advanced
molecular, immunohistochemical, biomechanical and in-vivo imaging techniques including a novel
contrast, ferumoxytol enhanced-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Fe-MRI). We will use in-vivo mouse
models of DVT, transgenic mice with deficiency in RLX (RLX -/-) under anticoagulant conditions
(warfarin versus rivaroxaban). Aim 2 will study the incidence of PTS defined by the clinical Villalta
score in patients after acute proximal lower extremity DVT that have been randomized to either
standard warfarin or rivaroxaban and explore RLX as a plasma biomarker and Fe-MRI as a
radiographic biomarker in a small, double blinded, randomized, controlled trial. RLX's potential as an
effective anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic makes it a promising therapeutic agent for preventing PTS.
 This award will provide the support for Dr. Nguyen to develop expertise in: (1) advanced molecular
and imaging techniques including ultrasound (US), Fe-MRI and in-vivo molecular imaging, (2) pre-
clinical approaches and models, (3) training in advanced patient-oriented research including research
design, implementation and biostatistics, and (4) professional academic training including
management and leadership. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nguyen has assembled a diverse and
multidisciplinary team of physicians and scientists and designed a training plan to develop essential
skills required to achieve her career goals and complete this scientific proposal. With a combination of
hands on scientific training and formal didactic education through OHSU's graduate school programs,
she will improve her proficiency in the following specific areas: 1) vascular and molecular biology, 2)
immunology, 3) advanced microscopy, 4) Fe-MRI and micro-CT, 4) US including elastography, 5)
biomechanical analysis, 6) prospective clinical research design and implementation, 7) clinical data
collection and management and 8) data analysis and biostatistics. The creative and collaborative
environment at OHSU will allow her to complete the aims in this proposal and achieve her long-term
goal of becoming a surgeon-scientist with a focus on vascular biology and venous diseases."
10911010,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The UT Gastroenterology / Hepatology research training program is aimed at producing the next generation of
scientific leaders focused on understanding digestive and liver diseases. The program involves a variety of
disciplines broadly categorized into two main areas: basic scientific research and patient-oriented clinical and
translational research. The training program accepts individuals with a clinical training background in Internal
Medicine (M.D. or M.D./Ph.D. candidates), as well as in Pediatrics, Surgery or Pathology. In addition, trainees
without clinical training (Ph.D. candidates) are also part of our program. One unique characteristic is the
inclusion of a significant proportion of minority trainees, primarily of Hispanic origin. Trainees benefit from a
vast array of potential mentors including 45 Faculty that participate directly in this program, as well as a very
rich milieu of scientific investigators across our campus. The scientific base of the training program includes
research expertise in multiple areas critically important to the field, including 6 main themes: (i) immunity, (ii)
microbial effectors, (iii) cancer biology, (iv) metabolism and fatty liver, (v) nutrition and obesity, and, (vi)
development and stem cell biology. The training curriculum is flexible, but has two basic components. First, all
of our trainees participate in a structured lecture series that highlights cutting edge research in fields of
gastroenterology and hepatology, and career development training offered through the postdoctoral affairs
office, which includes a course in responsible conduct of research as well as other pertinent training
experience for this stage of career development. A number of ad hoc training experiences are also devised to
address gaps of individual trainees. In addition to core educational activities, direct training in research takes
place primarily under the research mentor’s guidance in a basic laboratory or as part of a clinical research
group. Typically, our trainees devote 2 to 3 years to their research training. The basic science training
experience includes learning a variety of techniques in biochemistry, physiology, molecular biology and
genetics, as well as participation in works-in-progress seminars and national or international scientific meetings
relevant to the particular discipline. On the other hand, clinical and translational research involves formal
training in study design, including ethics and biostatics, through formal training programs offered at our
University. Finally, for our trainees with a clinical background in Internal Medicine, this research training
program is integrated with our clinical fellowship in Gastroenterology and Hepatology, which includes a
minimum of 18 months of dedicated clinical rotations. Therefore, in most instances the training period will last
from 4 to 6 years for the six individuals for whom support is being requested. Altogether, this program is
designed to train individuals who will be effective investigators and academic leaders in the fields of
Gastroenterology and Hepatology."
10911013,"Candidate: The long-term career goal of Dr. Jonathan Cherry is to become an independent VA investigator and
establish a research laboratory focused on head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Cherry is primarily
interested in how repetitive head trauma received during military service or contact sports contributes toward the
development and progression of the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).
During the proposed CDA2, Dr. Cherry will build off his graduate and postdoctoral experience studying
neuroinflammation and inflammatory cells, and expand his knowledge of [bioinformatics, single cell RNA-
sequencing], human neuroanatomy and clinical disease presentation to accomplish the proposed aims. In
addition to formal course work and regular meetings with Dr. Ann McKee (Mentor) and his advisory committee,
Dr. Cherry will receive weekly hands-on training in brain dissection. The support provided by the proposed CDA2
will be instrumental in shaping Dr. Cherry into a successful VA investigator, and result in critical and timely
knowledge regarding CTE in Veterans.
Environment: The Veterans Affairs – Boston University – Concussion Legacy Foundation (VA-BU-CLF) brain
bank at VA Boston contains the world’s largest neuropathologically diagnosed cohort of CTE cases and
represents the forefront of CTE research. Personnel and senior scientists at the Jamaica Plain VA hospital (VA
Boston) and the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (BU CSTE) are the world’s
leading experts in CTE and neurodegeneration. The facilities and personnel provide the ideal environment to
perform the training and research described in this proposal. Dr. McKee is an experienced mentor, having trained
over 30 researchers of all levels that have had subsequent successful careers. The many centers affiliated with
VA Boston and the BU CSTE will also allow for multiple collaborations.
Research: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been called the “signature injury” of Operation Iraqi
Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom. Furthermore, many soldiers will receive multiple mTBIs. Repetitive head
trauma is the single greatest risk factor for developing CTE, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by
progressive memory and behavior impairments. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem; thus, the
need to understand what factors drive pathology are critical to finding novel biomarkers to diagnose CTE and
create effective therapeutics for living patients. Neuroinflammation has recently been implicated in CTE
pathologic progression; however, the mechanisms are still unclear. The work proposed in this study aims to
understand how neuroinflammation potentially leads to CTE as a consequence of repetitive head trauma. First,
[Dr. Cherry will identify all the inflammatory or neurodegenerative cell populations that emerge after repetitive
mTBI (rmTBI) using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Dr. Cherry will compare the
neuroinflammatory cell populations using tissue from individuals with no history of rmTBI and neurodegenerative
disease, individuals with history of rmTBI but no neurodegenerative disease, and individuals with a history of
rmTBI and CTE stage I or II (i.e. mild CTE). This analysis will identify individual populations of cells and
investigate important mechanistic cellular populations that emerge after head trauma and during early CTE. This
will be the first study to perform snRNA-seq using human brains with a history of rmTBI. Finally, Dr. Cherry will
comprehensively analyze the observed neurodegenerative subpopulations using up to 9 color multiplex staining
to visualize the regional location of each population. He will explore if the neurodegenerative subpopulations
have interactions with neuropathologic features such as hyperphosphorylated tau, Aβ, or TDP-43.]
Overall, results generated from this study are necessary to progress the fundamental understanding of
mechanisms behind neuroinflammation after head trauma, identify novel biomarkers to detect CTE, and design
therapies to treat disease in living subjects."
10911014,"Brain vascular pericytes are an essential component of the neurovascular unit and perform a number of diverse
functions in regulating brain homeostasis. A common feature of many neurodegenerative disorders is a
progressive disruption of vascular pericytes in the brain. The current studies observed pericyte degeneration in
the brain at several time points following repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) in mice. The
influence of head trauma on the pericyte population may be the result of disruptions in the PDGF (platelet-
derived growth factor) pathway. The interaction between the PDGF-BB ligand and the PDGFR-beta receptor is
tightly regulated and required for pericyte function and survival. The current studies also found PDGF-BB
levels in the brain were significantly diminished in r-mTBI mice and human TBI specimens. Thus, as pericyte
health is highly dependent on stimulation of the PDGF pathway, the diminished availability of PDGF-BB in the
brain following TBI may be driving pericyte degeneration post-injury. Moreover, given the role of pericytes in
white matter homeostasis, extracellular tau disposition, and neuroinflammation, the deterioration of the
pericyte population following head trauma could be a major driver of TBI pathophysiology. The hypothesis of
this proposal is that stimulation of the PDGF pathway will improve pericyte function and mitigate the TBI
phenotype. The objective of the proposed studies is to comprehensively evaluate the effect of PDGF-BB
stimulation on TBI pathophysiology and cognitive dysfunction, as outlined in the following Aims, 1) investigate
the effect of PDGF-BB on oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination following r-
mTBI, 2) evaluate tau degradation and elimination in the r-mTBI brain upon PDGF-BB stimulation, 3)
examine pericyte-mediated neuroinflammation in r-mTBI following PDGF-BB stimulation, and 4) determine
the influence of chronic PDGF-BB stimulation on r-mTBI pathophysiology and cognitive behavior. To evaluate
the effect of PDGF-BB stimulation in each of these Aims, the proposed studies will examine OPC differentiation
in conditioned media from r-mTBI microvessels and assess remyelination in r-mTBI brains. For tau
elimination, the tau degradation profile in isolated r-mTBI microvessels will be examined in addition to tau
residence time in the brain of r-mTBI mice. For neuroinflammation, the proposed studies will identify the
immunomodulatory factors secreted by r-mTBI pericytes, and the response of brain pericytes to TBI-relevant
inflammatory stimuli. Lastly, the effect of a chronic PDGF-BB treatment paradigm on TBI pathophysiology
and neurobehavior will be evaluated in r-mTBI animals. Collectively, this project will determine the
contribution of brain pericyte degeneration to white matter deficits, tau accumulation, and neuroinflammation
following head trauma. Moreover, the effect of PDGF-BB stimulation in mitigating these pathological features
and cognitive dysfunction will be assessed following r-mTBI, which may provide a novel strategy for the
treatment of brain injuries and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders."
10911121,"Abstract
 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all people with HIV (PWH) initiate ART and
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have started to roll-out a universal test and treat (UTT) strategy. Recent
trials have shown that expanded treatment does not always result in reduced HIV incidence at the population
level. Questions remain on the role of underlying factors that may reduce the benefits of UTT and drive the HIV
epidemic. According to a recent UNAIDS report, alcohol use is an overlooked factor in the HIV epidemic that
requires greater attention. Alcohol use increases HIV risk through sexual behaviors and reducing uptake and
adherence to ART. Thus, alcohol use may contribute to population level failure to achieve HIV elimination
targets. My proposed research will estimate the long-term, population impact of harmful alcohol use on HIV
transmission and mortality in the UTT era in Uganda. Uganda has one of the highest levels of alcohol use per
capita in SSA and has a generalized HIV epidemic, with a prevalence of 5.7%. The UTT strategy took effect in
Uganda in 2017. However, in 2019, 22% of PWH in Uganda were not on ART and 36% were not virally
suppressed. Uganda has an opportunity address both burdens by reducing harmful alcohol use. My research
will assess the value for money of investing in alcohol use interventions to reduce HIV transmission in the era
of UTT in Uganda. This project will improve understanding of the relationship between harmful alcohol use and
the HIV epidemic through the following aims: 1) Estimate the prevalence of harmful alcohol use and
relationships with receipt of ART and viral load suppression in the era of UTT in Uganda 2) Quantify the
contribution of harmful alcohol use to HIV transmissions and mortality in Uganda during the UTT era, using
infectious disease modeling. 3) Determine the cost-effectiveness of alcohol reduction interventions to prevent
HIV transmission, in Uganda. The candidate, Dr. Adriane Wynn, is well qualified to conduct this research
because of her strong background in quantitative methods and track record of publications and successful
grant writing. Over the 5-year award period, Dr. Wynn will achieve the following career development objectives:
1) Develop expertise in the epidemiology and intersection of alcohol use and HIV and alcohol reduction
interventions in the era of UTT in Sub-Saharan Africa. 2) Gain skills in modeling the population impact of
alcohol use on HIV transmission and disease progression. 3) Acquire expertise in health economic evaluation
of alcohol reduction interventions incorporating HIV transmission prevention benefits. 4) Obtain expertise in the
ethical conduct of research pertaining to alcohol-using populations and those at risk for or living with HIV. 5)
Expand professional development skills in preparation for a successful academic career by further developing
skills in grantsmanship, publication, and scientific collaborations. These aims are in line with the Office of AIDS
Research high priority topics: “Reducing Incidence of HIV/AIDS” and the NIAAA’s Strategic Plan."
10895490,"Advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment have dramatically improved long-term survival of
those diagnosed with breast cancer. However, this success has been tempered by a parallel increased
incidence of chronic conditions in breast cancer survivors, in particular cardiovascular disease (CVD), due
at least in part to cardiotoxic treatment regimens. Current evidence-based guidelines for preventing and
controlling CVD in breast cancer survivors are broad, and we lack clear guidance for assessing
individualized risks of cardiovascular events. Existing CVD risk prediction models focus on the general
population and rely only on a limited number of variables. The adoption and integration of electronic
health record (EHR) systems has provided a wealth of information about individual characteristics at the
point of care, including unstructured clinical narratives, imaging data, and structured clinical variables.
However, the real-world EHR data is highly imbalanced including the fraction of patients with CVD
outcomes and the uniform distribution of time for the CVD development since BC diagnosis. Our
overarching goal is to develop solid computational and theoretical foundations for learning from
imbalanced real-world data, with an emphasis on BC-CVD outcome risk prediction. Specifically, we will
develop a computational framework for imbalanced classification and imbalanced regression tasks on the
CVD risk prediction among BC survivors using multimodal EHR data. The successful implementation of
this project would lay a computational foundation for imbalanced learning and can provide more accurate
tools for predicting BC CVD outcomes."
10917514,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Macromolecule drugs, specifically peptides, are an attractive therapeutic class given they are more potent and
target specific than small molecules yet demonstrate superior tissue permeation and manufacturability compared
to large proteins. As such, they are one of the most clinically and commercially viable therapeutic modalities for
treating chronic conditions such as metabolic disease, ageing, infectious disease, and inflammatory disorders.
Peptides however are also highly biodegradable, poorly absorbed in the GI tract, and rapidly cleared from the
body which has necessitated administration via repeated injections. These constant injections create significant
burden for patients, especially those managing chronic disease, and thus result in poor adherence. While
molecular structural modifications, enteric coatings and permeation enhancing excipients (PEs) have marked
major advances in oral delivery technologies, the critical challenge of sufficient GI absorption has not been solved.
A key hurdle has been the dynamic intestinal environment, where variable contents and rapid gastric emptying
result in insufficient co-localization of the target therapeutic agent and PE excipients. Consequently, the addition
of large amounts of PEs to current oral macromolecule formulations results in only a minor improvement in
absorption. Syntis’ Gastrointestinal Synthetic Epithelial Lining (GSEL) technology is synthetic tissue platform that
enterically delivers a mucoadhesive polydopamine (PDA) lining to the small intestine. When GSEL is co-
formulated with therapeutic agents, these compounds are incorporated into the PDA lining to create an evenly
distributed drug depot that lasts between 18-24 hours, significantly increasing GI residence time and thus
systemic absorption of the target drug compound. In pigs, GSEL has demonstrated the ability to increase the
half-life of anti-parasitic drug praziquantel tenfold, and total absorption (AUC) fourfold. In this SBIR Fast-Track
proposal. we propose to build on the previous oral delivery work achieved with praziquantel to enable peptide
macromolecule compounds. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the GSEL platform, we propose to identify
GSEL-compatible formulations of model peptide drugs and permeation enhancers, optimize composition for co-
localization and depot formation in the small intestine, and create tablets of lead formulations for oral delivery.
At the successful conclusion of the work described herein, the next steps will be to finalize raw materials sourcing
for GMP manufacturing, initiate GLP toxicity studies with a CRO, and finalize a clinical plan for a first-in-human
single ascending dose study."
10917785,"ABSTRACT
Cellular behaviors are modulated by a variety of stimuli in the environment, which can be generally categorized
as chemical, physical, and biological factors. Previous work suggests that physical forces, both at the mesoscale
of cell-cell interactions and the microscale of ligand-receptor binding events, play a critical role in regulating cell
physiology. For example, stem-cell differentiation is regulated by neighboring cells and the stiffness of the
extracellular matrix, while T cells are better activated by target cells with a mechanically strong cortex. The T-
cell receptor also bears forces exerted from the pMHC, which affects receptor activation in a non-monotonic
manner. While a plethora of evidence suggests the critical role of mechanical force in regulating cell fate and
activation states, force itself has rarely been considered or exploited as a target for cell engineering and
therapeutics development. Major hurdles include the lack of effective sensors that can digitally sense mechanical
forces, and the lack of genetically encoded intracellular devices that can convert mechanical forces into a
signaling cascade that modulates cell states. In this proposal, we will combine state-of-the-art technologies in
protein design, RNA synthetic biology, and cell engineering to develop “mechaswitches”: universal, modular and
programmable signal transduction systems that are able to trigger specific cellular actions in response to
mechanical signals. Each mechaswitch is composed of a protein-based force sensor inserted within a force-
bearing protein of interest and a transducer mRNA that implements a desired cellular action. When the protein
of interest is subjected to a defined range of forces, the mechaswitch force sensor responds by changing its
conformation. This conformational change is in turn detected by a sensing element within the transducer mRNA
that either switches on or off the expression of specific proteins that modulate cell behavior. We will develop
sensors covering a wide range of molecular forces and RNA switches that control protein expression with high
fidelity. In proof-of-principle experiments, we will apply mechaswitches to program cell differentiation in defined
extracellular environments and to modulate T cell proliferation and activation in response to specific antigens.
Because of the modularity of mechaswitches, which enables their sensing and output components to be rapidly
swapped and recombined, we envision a host of other uses for mechaswitches that could transform the study
and application of mechanical forces in cell biology. The successful realization of this project is expected to not
only advance basic research in mechanobiology, but also lay the foundation for the first therapeutic strategies
informed by the mechanical signals and target mechano-properties of diseased cells and proteins."
10917862,"Preclinical Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a significant role in monitoring radiotracer
biodistributions for the development of new drugs and cancer therapies. The Standardized Uptake Value
(SUV) and the kinetic tissue parameters are some of the most important (semi-) quantitation measures
in static and dynamic PET analysis. However, the calculation of those quantities hinges on the ability to
clearly delineate the organ Region-Of-Interest (ROI) from an anatomical reference. Cross-comparison of
different biodistributions is also cumbersome due to complex registration strategies of each animal with
an unknown pose and size. Operator bias and lack of efficient co-registration strategies result in poor
data reproducibility, high data variability, low data throughput and prohibits the use of fully automated
data parsing and data analysis for predicting early therapy outcomes with high sensitivity. In Vivo
Analytics will directly address these shortcomings by developing InVivoAX. It will be a cloud-based PET
data analysis tool, which will enable automatic organ ROI extraction followed by an instantaneous
biodistribution analysis of the SUV and kinetic tissue parameters. InVivoAX will automatically co-register
PET images to the animal’s anatomy and will calculate biodistributions in almost real-time. InVivoAX
consists of several novel parts. First, a Body Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) enables consistent
spatial and longitudinal registration of the animal’s pose and location to the PET data. Second, a
statistical mouse atlas based on an Organ Probability Map (OPM) provides a digital and operator-
independent organ ROI template. Third, cloud-based software with a browser-based user interface
enables an automatic biodistribution analysis. InVivoAX does not rely on manual delineation of organs.
A machine-driven data analysis fully eliminates operator-dependent variability and increases data
reproducibility. It will enable the drug development team to quantitate the impact of candidate
therapeutics with the highest accuracy, reduces the time to enter clinical trials, reduces costs, and
ensures the quantification and consistency of PET data. In Aim 1, we will modify the BCAM for PET
imaging by including respiratory monitoring and extended limb positioning. In addition, we will build a
multi-animal plugin module that can hold up to four animals and will enable high-throughput imaging. In
Aim 2, we will build an Ad Hoc OPM that increases the spatial registration accuracy of the OPM. The
OPM will be built from segmented cryosections and CT scans. Furthermore, we will perform PET
imaging of tumor bearing mice using 18F-FDG and confirm the ability for improved biodistribution
analysis of the Ad Hoc OPM vs the static OPM. In Aim 3, we will build the cloud-based data analysis
platform. The successful completion of the proposed project will help to commercialize InVivoAX, which
will be sold as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) using different plugin modules for existing PET systems."

The objective of this proposal is to investigate the ability of an injectable polypeptide scaffold -- inSoma Bio’s
proprietary elastin-derived biomaterial FractomerTM -- to improve outcomes after peripheral nerve repair. This
objective is motivated by the observation that peripheral nerve injuries (PNI) affect >20 million people in the US
alone, with $150 billion in healthcare costs annually, and is a cause of devastating functional disability and
chronic pain in those affected. The gold-standard treatment for PNI is primary neurorrhaphy when a tension-free
repair approach is feasible; otherwise, secondary options such as interposition autografts, decellularized
allografts, or nerve conduits are used. However, regardless of approach, only about 50% patients achieve
meaningful sensorimotor recovery and the majority of patients continue to experience chronic pain. Lack of
success is generally attributed to a poor microenvironment for neuroregeneration which must simultaneously be
able to provide neovascularization, low inflammation, cell infiltration, and successful neuroaxonal migration.
Current treatment strategies fail to address all these needs. Motivated by this clear clinical need, we will
investigate the applicability of Fractomer to improve outcomes after peripheral nerve repair. Fractomer is a
unique biomaterial that transitions from an injectable liquid at room temperature to a physically crosslinked,
porous network. Fractomer has been shown to be highly biocompatible, integrating into the surrounding tissue,
initiating remodeling, cell infiltration, and vascularization. Further, its ability to phase transition under the action
of body temperature, letting it be injected as a low-viscosity liquid, allows for its easy handling and integration in
the operating room, and its scalable manufacturing process means that it has the capability to be a commercially
viable product. Our central goal will be to demonstrate that Fractomer is uniquely suited to provide the needed
mechanical support and well-vascularized microenvironment essential for successful neuroaxonal regeneration.
Our strategy will include tailoring the Fractomer formulation to have the correct porous microarchitecture and
mechanical properties for peripheral nerve repair applications. We will then investigate the ability of Fractomer
to augment outcomes following peripheral nerve repair in models of rat sciatic nerve injury. Functional and
histological testing will be performed and compared to current gold-standard primary neurorrhaphy and
commercially available products from Avance and Integra. If this proposal is successful, it will provide a strong
foundation to commence large animal testing and begin scale-up for translation into clinical application, and
ultimately for commercialization into what is currently a $7B market opportunity. The improvement of surgical
outcomes following peripheral nerve repair by application of Fractomer has the potential for a transformative
impact for patients with peripheral nerve injuries by reducing long-term disability and chronic pain."

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; age 15-24) in East and southern Africa are disproportionately
affected by poor sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes related to HIV acquisition and unintended
pregnancy. Despite increasing recognition of AGYW’s interrelated needs for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) and family planning (FP) services, facility-based SRH programs struggle to reach at-risk AGYW and up
to 50% of AGYW seek contraception outside of health facilities, including at retail pharmacies. Pharmacy-based
care models can also increase options for expanding PrEP reach, and efforts are underway to implement
pathways for pharmacy-delivered PrEP in Kenya, an African leader in PrEP implementation at scale where
AGYW have been identified as a priority group. In collaboration with the Kenya Ministry of Health, our group is
conducting a cluster randomized clinical trial (RCT) at 20 pharmacies in Kisumu, Kenya–a region with an HIV
prevalence of up to 28% among women–to test the effectiveness of utilizing nurse-navigators at retail
pharmacies to enhance AGYW PrEP use. This trial (R01HD108041, NCT05467306) will enroll 1900 AGYW
seeking contraception at randomized pharmacies and participants will be offered daily oral PrEP and the
dapivirine vaginal ring (DPV-VR) per national guidelines. The WHO and UNAIDS jointly recommend integrated
FP and HIV prevention services, yet little is known about the interplay between PrEP and FP use among AGYW
seeking care in pharmacies, limiting strategic co-delivery of AGYW-centered SRH services in this context. Given
overlapping risk for unintended pregnancy and HIV among AGYW, integrated service delivery in pharmacies
could provide positive synergy for acceptability and quality of FP and PrEP services.
In this proposal, we apply an explanatory sequential mixed methods design to elucidate the synergies between
pharmacy-based FP and PrEP use and service delivery among Kenyan AGYW, and to translate our findings into
AGYW-centered implementation strategies for delivering quality integrated FP and PrEP in pharmacies. Aim 1
will use group-based trajectory modeling to identify FP use patterns associated with PrEP use outcomes among
a cohort of 1900 AGYW, and to characterize the patterns’ sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychosocial
correlates. In Aim 2, we will combine qualitative and human-centered design methods to contextualize synergies
in pharmacy-based FP/PrEP use and inform testable implementation strategies for integrated service delivery.
Guided by the Theoretical Domains Framework, we will determine the barriers and facilitators to integrated FP
and PrEP provision for AGYW in pharmacies. We will triangulate this work with participatory workshop methods,
engaging AGYW to identify key design elements for integrated pharmacy-based FP/PrEP implementation
strategies. This will be the first study aiming to improve implementation of integrated FP and PrEP access for
AGYW using a pharmacy-based model and will prime pharmacies to deliver multi-purpose technologies currently
in the pipeline."
10919085,"SUMMARY
The primary goal of this project is to integrate and assess the practicality of a closed-loop medication
management system dispensed through a hospital-based pharmacy with a focus on opioid pain management
for ambulatory patients with extremity fractures being discharged from the emergency department.
The Addinex system involves packaging medication in low-cost mechanical dispensers where each medication
dose requires a unique password provided by a smartphone app. The dispenser restricts medication access by
limiting each individual dose only as prescribed through unique one-time passcodes. Proper passcode entry via
dial-turning and the pull of a lever dispenses the next dose to the patient. Once patients retrieve a dose, they
are unable to access their next dose until the prescribed interval has passed, at which point they can request
the next passcode.
The system was designed to work with our partner pharmacy to deliver medication ahead of time for pre-
scheduled surgeries. However, to accommodate same-day treatment, Addinex must partner with a hospital’s
pharmacy. In addition, onboarding has heretofore been handled by a research associate. Non-study patients
must be able to on-board themselves for the Addinex platform to be an effective commercial product. This project
will adapt and enhance the system to meet these two requirements by establishing new protocols, aligning
patient management processes with emergency room workflows, streamlining onboarding procedures for both
patients and staff, and executing essential commercial steps required for successful implementation, including
the development of specific patient monitoring policies.
Collaboration with medical institutions is a crucial aspect to get the most out of the Addinex system by creating
monitoring policies tailored to various types of patients and procedures. These custom policies encompass
patient questions, notifications, alerts, and corresponding actions based on their responses. These will be
collaboratively designed in conjunction with clinical experts from Brown Emergency Department.
Once the logistical aspects of the revised system are in place, we will conduct a clinical trial involving 100 patients
with extremity fractures treated by the emergency department. Half the patients (25 adults and 25 minors) will
utilize the Addinex system, while the other half will have their opioids dispensed in a standard pill bottle as the
control group. Addinex’s system promotes the return of medication using a pre-paid disposal mailer once patients
have completed their course of treatment. The clinical study's main goals involve evaluating the system's
effectiveness with patients obtaining same day treatment. This evaluation will encompass an analysis of
medication consumption, disposal rates, pain levels, the impact of monitoring policies, and ensuring that the
established commercial protocols function seamlessly. Ultimately, the project aims to demonstrate that the
Addinex system can successfully operate within the broader hospital environment (same day and scheduled
procedures), controlling and monitoring opioid usage, promoting patient well-being, and lowering costs."

Children ages 2-6 are experiencing a steady decline in speech and language development rates. Lack of a
developmentally appropriate preschool curriculum with technology that supports active speech and language
development is nonexistent due to lack of oversight and regulations of preschool learning outcomes and access
to high quality and affordable educational products, and a commercial media industry exploiting these deficits.
Existing products also increase consumption of harmful passive screentime. Grounded in research in the fields
of speech-first instruction, inclusive music, and single character-driven narratives, Finnegan the Dragon has
created a classroom instructional system that supports functional and grammatical language development with
technology that addresses passive screen time consumption with all children. Finnegan the Dragon is a speech-
to-print preschool curricula and mobile gaming app that targets speech and early literacy skill development that
does not introduce the harmful effects of passive screen time. Modular units of instruction focused on sound
development are used by classroom teachers to instruct children in phonological awareness. The mobile gaming
app features extend classroom learning into the home, providing students and families with extended
opportunities to practice and master targeted speech and language milestones. The goal of Finnegan the Dragon
is to reinvent the nature of curriculum designed for preschool-aged children using technology paired with
classroom learning for more inclusive and impactful instruction. In this Phase I project, we will establish baseline
efficacy, usability, and adoptability of the Finnegan the Dragon learning system. Baseline efficacy will be
demonstrated by improvement of speech and language acquisition in children ages 3-4. Achievement of the
Phase I Aims will prepare the product for Phase II expansion of the classroom curricula to more precisely address
developmental milestones between ages 2-6 and increase usability and adaptability rates. The total available
market for preschool learners in the United States is 4.2M children, and our target market is the 2.1M children
enrolled in formal preschool learning institutions. The preschool market segmentations are made up of small,
mid-sized, large and national institutions who spend close to $65M annually in curriculum products. Our path to
market targets mid to large-sized institutions that serve between 500-15,000 students per region or district. We
have strategically partnered with Head Start of Oregon to validate classroom use and efficacy for large
institutions. We have also partnered with Vooks.com to drive customer acquisition for mid-sized institutions. Our
technology is currently patent pending and our branded materials are protected under copyright and trademark
law."
11194923,"The Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDD) Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) sponsors research and research training aimed  at  preventing  and  ameliorating  intellectual  and  developmental  disabilities.  The program supports , biomedical, biobehavioral, behavioral, and translational research in etiology, pathophysiology, screening, prevention, treatment, and epidemiology of these disorders.
Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is one of the most common genetic causes of intellectual disability, affecting ~1 in 700 babies in the U.S. each year (1, 2), or an estimated total of ~250,000 Americans living with Down syndrome in 2008 (3). Caused by the presence of 3 copies of chromosome 21 in most individuals, this condition is characterized by multiple organ system involvement in addition to intellectual disability. The molecular and cellular bases of intellectual disability due to Down syndrome have been a topic of intensive study, and murine models of the disease exist.
The Repository of Mouse Models for Cytogenetic Disorders (“Mouse Repository”) began in the 1970s to generate and distribute mouse models for cytogenetic disorders, with special emphasis on Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21).  The creation of mouse models relevant to DS began in the 1970s and continued with the demonstration of genetic synteny between a segment of mouse chromosome 16 (Mmu16) and human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), which led to the use of the trisomy 16 mouse (Ts16) as a model for studies relevant to DS.  With the subsequent genetic dissection of both mouse and human genomes, other genes present on Hsa21 were localized to mouse chromosomes 17 and 10 (Mmu17 and Mmu10) as well.   Partial trisomies for a number of syntenic chromosomal segments were generated in the 1980s, under contract to NICHD.  One of these partial trisomies, designated Ts65Dn,  proved  to include  approximately  150  genes  located  in  what  is  considered  the  “Down syndrome critical region” of Hsa21.  Subsequently, these mice were produced and distributed, under an NICHD contract, to investigators approved for receipt of them by NICHD.
During the last 30 years, various investigators have generated other models relevant to DS.  These include, but are not limited to, Ts1Cje, Ts2Cje, Ts1Rhr, Ms1Rhr, Tc1, and others.  When these strains and stocks have been made available to the research community, the creation of a central repository has ensured  their maintenance on appropriate  genetic backgrounds and their distribution  to investigators upon request in a timely manner and subsequent to approval by NICHD. 
Many of these mouse strains are maintained under cryopreservation. In 2010, the NICHD reissued the contract “A Repository of Mouse Models of Cytogenetic Disorders” with a substantial increase in investment to ensure  timely  access  to  and  increased  availability  of  mouse  models  for  cytogenetic disorders, particularly Ts65Dn, to the research community, and to ensure increased experimental efforts to modify the existing genetic backgrounds for the various strains to increase availability and ease of use by investigators. At a workshop “Advancing Treatment for Alzheimer Disease in Individuals with Down Syndrome” held in April, 2013, the participants from the Alzheimer disease and DS research and advocacy communities expressed concern with the limited availability of existing model systems (other than the Ts65Dn mouse) to the research community at large. Since that meeting, the partial duplication strains Dup(16)Yey, Dup(17)Yey, and Dup(10)Yey have become available and are now part of this Mouse Repository. Each of these strains contains a duplication of one of the 3 mouse chromosome regions that are syntenic to HSA21, with Dup(16)Yey representing the largest number of murine genes syntenic to the human chromosome 21 Mouse models for DS available as of 2017 are reviewed in (4) and see Figure below. More recently, the TcMAC21 “humanized” mouse model of  DS  has  been  created  with  Hsa21  inserted  in  a  mouse  artificial  chromosome  (with  mouse centromere and telomere)—this is stably transmitted so mice have approximately the equivalent of 3 copies of chromosome 21 (2 mouse, one human), and share many features of the human condition (5). With  the  launch  of  the  trans-NIH  INCLUDE  (INvestigation of  Co-occurring  conditions  across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) project in June 2018, there has been a renewed interest in supporting  Down syndrome  research in the domains of  basic science, cohort development, and clinical trials. To support component 1 of the project, which is focused on conducting targeted, high- risk, high-reward basic science studies to understand chromosome 21 biology and the co-occurring conditions in DS, there is a pressing need to ensure the availability of high-quality murine models of the  condition  that  replicate  human  traits.  Combined  with  concerns  about  the  Ts65Dn  model’s limitations with regard to modeling the human trisomy, it is important that new model(s) be added to this Mouse Repository."

Sensory experiences are detected by the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and then
transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) where neurons within the brain respond
to produce appropriate behavioral output. These behavioral outputs include locomotion
whose underlying neural mechanisms are conserved throughout many taxa. Sensory
experiences or the action of neurotransmitters can act on the neural circuits that carry out
locomotion through various mechanisms to modulate its behavioral features. Dopamine,
a neurotransmitter in the CNS, is known to act as a neuromodulator of motor output,
however the exact neural circuits involved and the mechanisms by which the neural
activity modulates locomotion remain unknown. To do this, I will employ advanced genetic
tools to manipulate dopaminergic neuron activity in the CNS and record the larvae’s
resultant behavior with a novel robotic rig that allows for long-term behavioral assays on
the order of days. I find that larvae do modulate aspects of their locomotive behavior in
response to pharmacological manipulation of the dopaminergic pathway. In vivo neural
confocal microscopy and calcium imaging will be conducted to probe the descending
neural targets in the neural circuit that control larval locomotion. Manipulations of
identified neurons will be carried using genetic tools to demonstrate their roles in the
behaviors characterized. In this project I will 1) determine the behavioral impact of
dopamine signaling in the CNS through genetic manipulations and 2) identify and study
the downstream targets of dopamine neurons that control larval locomotion. These
experiments will use novel approaches and methods to understand the neuromodulatory
role of dopamine signaling on larval locomotion."
10927210,"Epigenetics is broadly defined as the heritable changes in gene expression and function that do
not alter DNA sequence. As an intermediate regulatory paradigm between DNA sequences and
gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms can exert substantial influence on brain development
on a scale that we are only beginning to appreciate. Furthermore increasing evidence indicates
that multiple neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric disorders are caused, at
least in part, by aberrant epigenetic modifications. Cytosine methylation serves as a critical
epigenetic mark by modifying DNA-protein interactions that influence transcriptional states and
cellular identity. 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has generally been viewed as a stable covalent
modification to DNA; however, the fact that 5-mC can be enzymatically modified to 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by Tet family proteins through Fe(II) α-KG-dependent
hydroxylation gives a new perspective on the previously observed plasticity in 5mC-dependent
regulatory processes. Epigenetic plasticity in DNA methylation-related regulatory processes
influences activity-dependent gene regulation and learning and memory in the central nervous
system (CNS). Hydroxylation of 5mC to 5hmC presents a particularly intriguing epigenetic
regulatory paradigm in the mammalian brain, where its dynamic regulation is critical. Emerging
evidence also suggests potential epigenetic roles for a novel DNA adenosine modification, N6-
methyladenine (N6mA). Thus the discovery of both 5hmC/5fC/5caC and N6mA in mammalian
genome significantly increases the DNA epigenetic complexity and intriguingly all these
modifications are enriched in brain. The proposed works here will integrate various disciplines
(genetics/genomics, bioinformatics, biochemistry, and cell biology) to understand the crosstalk
among the dynamic DNA modifications during neurodevelopment and aging, and their roles in
the pathogenesis of neurological disorders."
10925333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In collaboration with the University of Alabama (UAB), we propose to conduct the five-year, “Trauma
Resuscitation with Group O Whole Blood Or Products” (TROOP) trial, a pragmatic, multicenter, phase III
randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of whole blood, compared with
component blood therapy in trauma patients predicted to require large volume blood transfusions.
The primary hypothesis of the TROOP trial is that the group treated with whole blood will exhibit no worse
mortality and/or lower mortality compared to component therapy at 6 hours. The rationale for this trial is that
although the current standard of care in trauma transfusion is the balanced administration of equal numbers of
units of blood components (packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets), 123 U.S. trauma centers currently
use LTOWB for trauma resuscitation. Thus, a renewed approach to blood transfusion therapy in trauma is to
use whole blood from the outset. Compared with component therapy, transfusion with whole blood offers several
logistical and potentially clinical advantages; however, there are only a small number of observational studies
that have compared the strategies. The specific aims of the TROOP trial clinical coordinating center (CCC)
application submitted by UAB are to: (1) determine the effectiveness of whole blood versus component therapy
at 6 hours in critically injured patients; and 2) evaluate the safety of whole blood compared to component therapy
by evaluating longer term endpoints: 24 hours, 30 days, and major complications.
To assess these specific aims, the trial uses a highly innovative, Bayesian, group-sequential, combined non-
inferiority/superiority design, and pre-planned cost-effectiveness analysis. The trial has been designed in
collaboration with NHLBI’s Innovative Clinical Trials Resource, funded by a U34 Planning Grant (U34HL148472).
The accompanying CCC application from UAB describes the details of the clinical background and rationale for
the study, eligibility criteria, treatment and follow-up procedures, and the organizational structure of TROOP.
The Coordinating Center for Clinical Trials in the Department of Biostatistics and Data Science at the University
of Texas Health Science Center at Houston will serve as the statistical and data coordination center (DCC) for
the TROOP Trial. This DCC application describes the TROOP trial aims, expertise of the DCC, its role in the
TROOP trial, details of data processing and management, and details of the Bayesian statistical design, analysis
plan, and potential pitfalls."

The widening gap in all-cause and CVD-mortality and morbidity rates in rural and urban America is at an all-
time high. Latino/as, the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., appear to be most affected by rural-urban
divide in CVD outcomes, as they are disproportionately burdened by CVD risk (overweight/obesity,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) and CVD mortality (20%, 2nd leading cause of death among Latino/as)
relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Unlike other groups where individuals in rural and urban areas have
differing CVD risk, rural and urban Latino/as have similarly high rates of CVD risk. Although, healthy diets/
nutrition, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity are linked to CVD risk, they have not been very
effective in reducing the CVD burden among racial/ethnic groups, specifically among Latino/as. Several studies
indicate that insufficient sleep (<7hrs./day) explains a significant amount of the CVD burden among Latino/as.
Preliminary evidence indicates that insufficient sleep may contribute to the observed CVD burden among
Latino/as, as Latino/as have greater odds of experiencing insufficient sleep compared with non-Hispanic
whites. Evidence also shows that insufficient sleep, which is associated with potentially life-threatening CVD,
is a key modifiable risk factor with great potential to reduce health disparities. However, it is unclear what
factors contribute to insufficient sleep (IS) disparities and IS-related CVD burden among rural and urban
Latino/as. To address these gaps, we will enroll 525 Latino/as in rural and urban communities to participate in
home-based studies using novel mHealth devices. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify behavioral,
genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors that are associated with insufficient sleep and IS-related CVD
and 2) assess effects of insufficient sleep on CVD risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, lipid profile, and
fasting plasma glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammatory risk markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). This study will
provide multi-level evidence supporting epidemiological findings of greater rates of insufficient sleep among
Latino/as, which may explain their disproportionate burden of CVD risk. It will also assess whether and why
rural and urban differences in IS exist among Latino/as and how that may lead to IS-related CVD outcomes.
These data will provide: 1) the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on
CVD health outcomes, 2) evidence to delineate factors underlying insufficient sleep and CVD burden among
Latino/as in rural and urban settings, and 3) a possible explanation of behavioral, genetic, environmental and
psychosocial determinants of insufficient sleep and related CVD risk factors in rural and urban Latino/as.
Findings can lead to actionable clinical, lifestyle, and policy interventions to improve Latino health."

Metastatic progression of the primary tumor accounts for the majority of cancer deaths. While the initial steps of
the metastatic cascade are rather well defined, identification of targets to block this process remains a major
clinical challenge. Previous studies have elegantly investigated the mechanistic contribution of tumor cell intrinsic
properties that promote metastasis in bladder urothelial carcinomas. However, the functional significance of the
tumor microenvironment and its contribution to this complicated process is not well characterized, and therefore,
warrants investigation. The long-term goal of this renewal application is to continue explore how collagens—a
major extracellular matrix component of the microenvironment—act as a ligand to mediate crosstalk with their
receptor on tumor cells to facilitate the metastatic cascade. We will investigate the downstream regulatory
mechanisms of collagen receptor signaling in both the primary tumor and metastatic sites, and to exploit these
regulatory processes as a revolutionizing approach to target metastases. Such innovative approaches to perturb
collagen-cancer crosstalk—not only at the primary tumor but also at the metastatic niche—will move the field
forward by providing a new conception in metastatic disease management, and likely extend beyond bladder
carcinomas to other cancer types."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common and aggressive lymphoma. Germinal center B-cell
(GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) are the two major biologically distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL.
Differentiation of these subtypes is essential for the right therapy. Gene expression signatures analysis for
diagnosis or monitoring or predicting recurrence of various cancers is widely used in clinical practice. However,
current assays require multiple qPCR reactions to analyze the gene signatures, increasing the health care cost
burden. Multiplexing qPCR technologies that can detect multiple genes are of high clinical significance. To
meet this need, this SBIR Phase I application proposes to develop a single RT-qPCR reaction Zip-MeltTM
DLBCL Classifier Assay, an 18 gene expression analysis, to differentiate ABC and GCB subtypes. Our high
multiplex assay has advantages as it can be done on a small amount of precious clinical samples, will reduce
the turnaround time, and labor cost and ultimately will decrease the health care cost.
The competitive advantage of our multiplex technology is that it expands the capacity of qPCR systems, can
be easily implemented on any existing qPCR systems, reduces the operational cost, and is ecofriendly
(decrease in environmental waste from reduction in plastics and chemical reagents). This chemistry-based
multiplexing technology can be easily integrated into a point of care system to expand the capacity and the
outreach to resource limited settings. The proposed studies involve development and optimization of Zip-
MeltTM DLBCL Classifier Assay, followed by performance characteristics studies in comparison to a
Comparator Assay. This Phase I application will establish a platform for detection of gene expression signature
to meet the clinical requirement of multianalyte detection in a single workflow."

Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) quantify the genetic component of an individual’s risk of eventually
developing a particular phenotype (generally a complex disease). They, along with more
traditional clinical risk prediction metrics, are a crucial component of future personalized
medicine protocols, by influencing the optimal timing of monitoring, preventative testing and
potential lifestyle modifications. While many PRS models have been proposed, they suffer from
two main drawbacks. Specifically, PRS models for the same disease have not been
systematically tested and evaluated for effectiveness using uniform, repeatable protocols; and
existing models are generally optimized for risk prediction in European ancestry individuals, and
are much less accurate when applied to people from other populations. This proposal will
address these shortcomings by
 1) Evaluating the performance of existing PRS for European ancestry individuals in a fair
 and consistent manner using both public (UK Biobank) and proprietary data
 2) Generating an improved ancestry reference panel that includes deeper representation of
 indigenous American groups
 3) Developing novel machine learning PRS models applicable to individuals with diverse
 and admixed ancestry
 4) Implementing a combined ancestry estimation + PRS application that is commercially
 available through AWS or DNAnexus
Together, this proposed work will ensure that the benefits of improved disease risk prediction
are available to all individuals, regardless of ancestral background."

The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR application is to develop a novel drug candidate to treat
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a fatal disease that remains uncurable and carries a
median survival of 2-3 years post diagnosis. The two current FDA-approved drugs Nintedanib
and Pirfenidone marginally extend quality-adjusted life years while presenting severe life-altering
side effects, resulting in extremely poor compliance. Current pipeline therapeutics are focused
on more effective targets to improve functional outcomes but many, if not all, present significant
safety concerns by targeting critical, systemically active receptors and intracellular signaling
proteins. Our tool compound, VSR-H5, has demonstrated an ability to 1) specifically target only
regions of ongoing fibrosis within diagnosed IPF patient lung tissues while not binding healthy
tissues/regions; 2) selectively inhibit activation of patient-derived fibroblasts’ on pro-fibrotic
mimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) in vitro; and 3) mitigate fibrosis progression in multiple in vivo
mouse models of lung fibrosis and a clean tox profile. Our approach specifically avoids systemic
disruption of critical, normal receptor engagement by targeting a unique, cryptic epitope that is
only exposed in tissues undergoing active fibrosis. In this proposal we will first (Phase I) perform
affinity maturation and liability assessment and removal to create a pool of candidate antibody
drugs. Then in Phase II we will perform successive selection assays to establish our primary
drug candidate from the pool generated in Phase I and then further establish its translatability
through a series of PK/PD, toxicity/safety, and efficacy analyses in established animal models,
while exploring potential formulations for future process development and manufacturing. At the
successful conclusion of this project, we will be poised to design and initiate IND-enabling studies."

This application seeks continuation of funding for the program “Training for Scientists Conducting Research to
Reduce HIV/AIDS Health Disparities” at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). This program
addresses the urgent need to reduce HIV-related health disparities in the U.S. communities most affected by
HIV. Our training program provides education and mentoring to early-career social and behavioral HIV
researchers (hereafter Visiting Professors or VPs) who have demonstrated cultural expertise, a commitment to
improving the health of communities affected by HIV, and are initiating innovative programs of research to
advance the objectives of the Office of AIDS Research Annual Strategic Plan and program priorities of the
NIMH Division of AIDS Research (DAR). The aims of this five-year project are to: (1) Support VPs in refining
innovative ideas, concepts, and theories into clearly articulated and rigorous HIV health disparities research
with HIV-impacted communities; (2) Fund an individualized applied research experience (ARE) to accelerate
VPs’ research programs and generate findings to be used as preliminary data in NIH grant proposals; (3)
Provide education and mentoring to VPs in the conceptualization, writing, submission, revision, and
resubmission of NIH research proposals through use of an individual development plan (IDP), mentoring
meetings, seminars, webinars, writing retreats, and peer networking; and (4) Provide ongoing individualized
assistance and mentoring focused on research and career development through peer reviews and
consultations to VPs who have completed the program. We will accomplish these aims through a research
education and mentoring program at UCSF’s Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS). The centerpiece of
the proposed program is a summer training institute in which VPs, who have not yet obtained R01-level
funding, participate intensively over a three-year period. Each VP is in residence at CAPS for six weeks for
three consecutive summers. In the first summer, the training institute helps VPs develop their ideas into
feasible programs of research so that they are poised to implement an applied research experience over the
next year. During the second summer, VPs begin an NIH grant proposal, incorporating results gleaned from
their program-funded applied research experience. Following the second summer, they finalize their grant
proposal and submit it to NIH. In the third summer, they revise and resubmit their proposals to NIH. The
activities are additionally enhanced through webinars and meetings with faculty mentors scheduled during the
academic year. Alumni receive additional support to remain in the HIV research pipeline through alumni peer
reviews, writing retreats, and participation as alumni experts in the summer institutes. The proposed program is
well positioned to leverage CAPS’s unique environment to provide tailored research education and mentoring
in social/behavioral HIV research, assist program participants to become successful independent investigators,
and simultaneously increase the diversity of HIV scientists."

Only 59% (29-73%) of Alaska Native people have been adequately screened for colorectal cancer (CRC),
which could save lives, despite having the highest reported incidence of CRC in the world. A new at-home

screening rates. Our long-term goal is to improve screening and reduce CRC-attributable mortality. The
objective of this application is to test the effectiveness of MT-sDNA for increasing CRC screening in Alaska
Native communities using a mixed methods, community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. The
study will be conducted in collaboration with regional Tribal health organizations who are responsible for
providing health care to geographically remote Alaska Native communities. This research has been requested
by Tribal organizations. Although the proposed implementation strategy is evidence-informed and promising, it
is novel in that MT-sDNA has not been evaluated in the tribal health setting or among rural/remote populations.
Using the Social Ecological Model, our research will be multi-level, examining influence on patients, providers,
and tribal health organizations (THOs). This research study will pursue two specific aims: (1) Identify patient-,
provider-, and system-level factors associated with CRC screening preferences, uptake, and follow-up; and (2)
test the effectiveness of graded intensity MT-sDNA intervention in the Alaska Native community setting. For
the first aim, focus groups with Alaska Native people who are non- or inadequately adherent to CRC screening
guidelines, and surveys and interviews with healthcare providers will be used to identify individual,
interpersonal (provider), and health system factors for future intervention. For the second aim, a three-arm
cluster randomized controlled trial (high intensity with patient navigation, medium intensity with mailed
reminders, usual care) will provide evidence on the usefulness of MT-sDNA in remote tribal communities as
well as the first data on MT-sDNA diagnostic follow up adherence rates in the Alaska Native population. This
aim will also provide evidence on the usability of MT-sDNA in the Alaska setting by evaluating MT-sDNA
sample quality and neoplastic yield, which will inform plans to scale-up the intervention model. This project is
innovative because an effective strategy for achieving higher screening rates than current practice could lead
to increased prevention or early detection of CRC cases among Alaska Native people. The proposed research
is significant because it will address a health disparity of community concern. This research has the potential to
sustainably improve public health by increasing CRC screening rates among a rural/remote tribal population as
well as provide a model for other integrated health systems that provide care to high-risk or underserved
populations in the U.S. and worldwide."

We request funds to continue the interdisciplinary training program in genomics at the University of
Washington and affiliated institutions. The program focuses on preparing pre- and postdoctoral trainees for
a research career in genomics and computational biology with an emphasis on translational research.
Trainees will engage in projects that include discovering how a genome encodes the information for RNAs,
proteins and its own structure and replication; measuring and analyzing sequence variation; developing
technologies for high-throughput experimental assays including-next generation sequencing; and
generating computational tools to analyze genomic variants and their impact on mRNA and protein function.
As these research challenges demand interdisciplinary approaches and multidisciplinary collaborations, one
goal of this program is to attract individuals trained in computer science, statistics, physics, and engineering
to biological research. Another goal is to train cellular and molecular biologists to incorporate genomic-
based quantitative analyses in their research to allow them to effectively collaborate at this interdisciplinary
interface. Given the wide diversity in educational backgrounds and career goals among our trainees, the
program emphasizes highly individualized training programs and interdisciplinary research. A
multidisciplinary group of 51 faculty, selected for their involvement in genome analysis and their strong
record of collaborative interactions, comprises the training team. Research experience is complemented
with a variety of didactic courses and electives. The trainees are also exposed to discussions on ethical
research conduct and the ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research. Breadth of knowledge
and program cohesion are achieved through trainee participation in two seminar series that feature genomic
research and computational biology, journal clubs, and research reports. In the coming five years, we will
continue to expand our program in genomics, proteomics, instrumentation development, computational
biology, and statistical genomics. We request funds to train 12 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral fellows per
year. The trainees will emerge with the skills necessary for success in the academic and biomedical
research environment of the 21st century made possible by advances in genomics."
10918136,"Project Summary
The ultimate product of our Center will be a series of comprehensive developing human and non-human primate
(NHP) brain atlases of unprecedented cellular, spatial, and anatomical resolution. In Aim 1, we will characterize
transient cell populations, establish the diversity of cell types present in specific brain regions, unravel complex
developmental trajectories, and reveal conserved and divergent cell-type specific features. We will jointly profile
of single nucleus RNA (snRNA-seq) and accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq) using the 10X Genomics
snMultiome platform. All aims will include 30 anatomically distinct regions of fresh frozen developing human,
rhesus macaque, and marmoset brains at four developmental epochs: mid-gestation, neonatal, childhood, and
adolescence and perform probe-based validation.
 In Aim 2, we will conduct spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic mapping of cell types in fresh-frozen
developing human and NHP brains using DBiT spatial-RNA-seq and spatial-ATAC-seq platforms. This approach
will allow us to discover spatial and temporal features, including the developmental niche, proximity of cell types
to each other, and regional abundance. In Aim 3 we will create Common Coordinate Frameworks for the
developing human and NHP brain using high resolution (9.4T and 7T) MRI-based developmental structural
atlases and leveraging existing developing human MRI data. Our final aim will create a cross species molecular
and spatial atlas of brain development in human and NHP. This integration will enable us to identify conserved
and diveregent aspects of the human brain and identify the developmental stages, spatial distribution, gene
regulatory elements and cell types vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. We will
coordinate to ensure that our developmental atlases merge with adult human, macaque and marmoset atlases
that other BICAN centers create.
 The data collected by our Center will be perfectly aligned with the overarching goal of the BICCN in
generating a comprehensive census of brain cell types across the lifespan that integrates molecular, anatomical,
functional, and cell lineage data for describing cell types in human and NHP brains. By leveraging innovations
in cell capture and spatial mapping technologies, the current proposal will have broad implications for
understanding the cellular origins of diseases and for highlighting patterns of selective cell type vulnerability in
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Additionally, our plans to create
developmental cellular and molecular resolution maps of marmoset and macaque will provide foundational data
for establishing primate models of human disease. Finally, our atlas of conserved molecular, epigenetic, and
spatial properties will support the precise monitoring, targeting, and replacement of specific cell types and the
improvement of in vitro models."

 We propose to continue to provide data generation and processing activities that will enrich a
genomic data resource to propel pediatric disease research. Key elements to a successful program will
be the provision of high quality genome sequence data on well-phenotyped patients and their families;
the collection and accessibility of data to the research community in an intuitive manner; and the
integration of genetic data with phenotypic information in the context of this program and comparison to
other large data resources. The ultimate goal is to assemble a complete catalogue of genes that
underlie structural birth defects and pediatric cancer and to enable the use of this information to better
understand disease mechanism, diagnostic opportunities and therapeutic direction.
 We propose to continue as a Kids First Sequencing Center at the Broad Institute as we have done
for the past six years for the program and as we have also done in support of other large flagship NIH
genome projects. Our center brings the domain expertise is high throughput data generation, processing
and analysis, and disease gene discovery required to meet the objectives of the Kids First Program.
 We will apply deep, high-quality whole genome sequencing data on selected samples. We will be
flexible to work closely and accommodate the needs and interests of selected X01 Investigators. Over
the next three-year period we can provide for as many as 23,000 samples pushing the boundary on new
data types and lower cost. We are flexible to a mix of cohort types, whether they are trio based (for
structural birth defects) or quads (in cancer studies). We will work with X01 Investigators to generate
complementary data types such as RNASeq or Long Read Sequencing when appropriate. We will
participate in the evaluation of these data types and their overall impact on discovery and scientific output
of the program.
 A key feature of our center is our implementation of a robust analytical framework for variant
assessment and disease gene discovery, which builds on Broad investigators’ world-leading roles in
statistical genetics, functional annotation, and clinical variant interpretation as well as access to exome
and genome data from hundreds of thousands of samples sequenced at Broad. This has enabled us to
build a systematic pipeline for gene discovery that will be made freely available to the Kids First program.
With data produced and processed in a consistent way, we can offer seamless integration of Kids First
data into our analytic framework. For many of the diseases targeted by pediatric research community,
confident discovery of causal genes will require aggregation of cases across centers around the world.
We will partner with the Kids First Data Resource Center in a variety of ways to ensure that the program
is well-aligned with other large-scale resource generation projects. With this, we hope to support Kids
First as a whole and establish standards for data sharing in clinical genomics, accelerating collaboration
and facilitating robust disease gene discovery."
10919224,"Abstract
 Cancer is the second most common cause of death in developed nations, and incidence is rising among
developing nations. An estimated 70% of cancers are attributable to “modifiable” risk factors, including obesity,
chronic inflammatory diseases, and poor diet, all of which have been associated with increased oxidative
stress. These are not themselves “carcinogenetic”, but they are thought to act as “cancer promoters”,
increasing the probability of developing cancer. With advances in whole genome sequencing and development
of computational techniques to examine the cancer genome, we can now use mathematical profiling of somatic
mutational profiles (termed mutational signatures) to identify potential causes underlying a given tumor (e.g.,
smoking versus UV light). It remains unclear, however, if there is a mutational signature that is a biomarker of
cumulative lifetime exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage and if this correlates
with cancer-associated lifestyle factors. Here, we will utilize cutting-edge multi-omic profiling and molecular
biology and computational tools to better understand the contribution/mechanism of oxidative stress as a
cancer promoter.
 To examine the correlation of ROS mutational signature levels and inflammation-related cancer risk
factors, we will perform whole genome sequencing and mutational signature analysis of a large cohort of
colorectal tumors from patients with detailed, longitudinally collected lifestyle data (e.g., smoking, caloric
intake, red meat intake, exercise level, etc.) collected by the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer
study. We will also evaluate whether accumulation of ROS-generated mutations is biased toward CTCF
binding loci and whether chromosomal architecture is modified by exposure to carcinogens or cancer-
associated processes, thereby mediating unique “epigenomic signatures”. These aims will also provide data
that can be used in the development of two novel computational tools for the analysis of cancer driver
mutational signatures and epigenomic signatures of carcinogen exposure.
 Finally, we will test the molecular and clinical benefit of intermittent fasting during daily radiation therapy
based on the hypothesis that lifestyle factors could modulate susceptibility to ROS mutagenesis. Patient-
reported quality of life and clinician-reported adverse events, as well as molecular assay for tissue-specific
levels of ROS-associated DNA damage, will allow us to assess whether intermittent fasting can reduce normal
tissue toxicity. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive examination of
the epidemiology and mechanism of ROS-mediated DNA damage in human cancers and demonstrate the
safety and potential efficacy of intermittent fasting as a clinically translatable and easily adaptable approach to
reducing both acute and chronic side effects associated with radiotherapy."
10919226,"Four million women undergo a 50 gram glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation annually in the United
States. This universal screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is intended to improve health and reduce
costs by allowing for treatments that will reduce the known complications associated with GDM. However, as
currently screened for, diagnosed, and treated, offspring born to women with GDM are still at much higher risk
for childhood obesity compared to the offspring of women without GDM. These female children born to women
with GDM are more likely to become obese adults and because GDM risk is dependent on maternal body
mass index, these women will be more likely to have GDM themselves when they become pregnant. This
cycle of GDM leading to increasingly obese future generations can only be broken with a better
understanding of the maternal glycemic profile during gestation so that the timing and types of
dysglycemia most associated with pregnancy complications, including childhood obesity, can be
identified. The overall objective of this application is to leverage Brown University/Women & Infants Hospital's
considerable pregnancy research infrastructure, high rates of early prenatal care, large delivery volume, and
track record of successful clinical research in diabetes in pregnancy to ensure this collaborative cohort study
investigating maternal glycemia in pregnancy is a success. Brown University/Women & Infants Hospital will
enroll at least 400 women (of the 2000 total enrollment) in the first trimester of pregnancy and follow them and
their offspring until the children are two years of age. While the final aims will be determined by a steering
committee of all participating centers, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Utilize continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) at 5 time points during gestation (first trimester, early second trimester, 24-28
weeks, third trimester, and post-partum) to better understand critical values and time periods when
dysglycemia is associated with pregnancy, and neonatal or early childhood complications, including
adiposity and body mass index z-score >85th percentile at 2 years of life; 2) create a biobank of
maternal serum at the 5 time points that will be used to compare traditional glucose tests (fasting,
glycosylated hemoglobin, and glucose challenge) to CGM results to determine optimal screen-positive
cut-offs; 3) use decision modeling to assess the costs and effects to US health care of any changes to
the timing or modality of GDM testing in pregnancy. If successful, this project will result in a more
complete understanding of glycemic changes over gestation, identify critical measures and gestational age
windows most associated with morbidity, and determine the optimal screening test to identify clinically
significant dysglycemia. This will allow glucose testing in pregnancy to be re-designed to achieve both a
healthier next generation and fiscal savings."

This application is a competing continuation of an Autism Centers of Excellence (ACE) Network entitled, “A
Longitudinal Brain and Behavior Study of Autism from Infancy through Adolescence”. Prior funding supported a
prospective, longitudinal study that has collected high quality brain imaging and behavior assessments in
children at high- and low- familial risk (HR, LR) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), starting in infancy, and at
various points at 3-6-9-12-15-24-36 months to 7-11 years of age. Key findings from this network have revealed
that: (1) early brain features of ASD are detectable by 6 months of age, well before diagnosis is possible; (2)
ASD-specific brain and behavior features change substantially throughout early childhood, as ASD emerges;
and (3) brain features in the first year of life are associated with later ASD behaviors and accurately predict ASD
diagnosis in individuals at 24 months of age. The overarching goal of this ACE Network proposal is to extend
into adolescence the follow-up of a prospective cohort of 400 subjects (300 HR; 100 LR) with detailed brain and
behavior assessment between 13-16 years of age. Adolescence is a time of substantial challenges to autistic
individuals. It is the time of peak onset of psychiatric disorders, rates of which are considerably higher in ASD
than in the general population, with particular vulnerabilities in ASD females. Adolescence sets the stage for
transition to early adulthood, a time when decline in daily living skills and worsening outcomes in ASD are
commonly reported. In this application we therefore propose to: (Aim 1) characterize brain and brain-behavior
trajectories in those with ASD, from infancy through adolescence, to gain insights into developmental
mechanisms that inform the timing and targets of intervention; (Aim 2) identify infant-to-school-age brain and
behavior features in those at elevated ASD familial risk, that predict clinically-relevant outcomes in adolescence
and, (3) define the expression of familial ASD risk in adolescent females, identify early childhood markers of
adolescent clinical impairment and, characterize patterns of infant-to-adolescent brain development, in
adolescent females at high familial risk for ASD. This study would be the first prospective examination of brain
and behavior features associated with ASD risk, in the same individuals, from infancy through adolescence. It
has the potential to: (1) inform about the nature and timing of underlying mechanisms and targets of intervention;
(2) elucidate childhood brain and behavior features that predict individual-level, adolescent dysfunction, related
to familial ASD risk; and (3) to provide new insights regarding the expression of ASD risk in adolescent females,
their identification earlier in childhood and associated patterns of brain development. This proposal addresses
“areas of interest” specified in the ACE RFA, including: (1) a focus on under-studied subgroups e.g., individuals
with ASD and co-occurring psychiatric conditions (Aim 1 and 2) and females with ASD (Aim 3); and (2) biological
mechanisms related to family-genetic and environmental interactions (Aim 1 and 2)."
10909785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammation is involved in an abundant number of acute and chronic skin pathologies, which together contribute
to high patient and healthcare burden. Topical immunosuppressants such as topical corticosteroids are first-line
treatments despite their association with a myriad of adverse effects such as skin atrophy, striae, and rosacea,
among others. Further, while many inflammatory skin conditions involve similar pathways of immune activation
and disease progression, the development of targeted anti-inflammatory therapies would aid in delineating our
understanding of the shared and unique molecular mechanisms that accompany inflammation in the skin.
Cholesterol is integral to the normal functioning of skin and recently, excess intracellular cholesterol has been
associated with inflammatory activation by interleukin-17A (IL-17A) in cultured keratinocytes. Interestingly, these
findings resemble the cholesterol-dependent inflammatory processes found in activated macrophages,
suggesting keratinocytes could be subjected to similar mechanisms of cholesterol regulation in the setting of
inflammation. Therefore, research is required to delineate the relationship between cholesterol metabolism and
keratinocyte-induced inflammation. Our lab pioneered a synthetic high-density lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (HDL
NP) capable of modulating cellular cholesterol through specifically binding to scavenger receptor class B type 1
(SR-B1), a transporter responsible for cellular cholesterol flux. Application of HDL NPs in the skin is attractive
due to the well-established presence of SR-B1 in the epidermis and the favorable physical properties of HDL
NPs that may enable keratinocyte targeting and localization to all layers of the epidermis. Further, topical HDL
NP administration in wounded corneal epithelial cells has demonstrated anti-inflammatory benefit, further
supporting a link between cholesterol modulation and immune activation. We aim to use HDL NPs as a powerful
tool to mechanistically study how changes in cholesterol metabolism affect inflammation in the skin. Our
overarching hypothesis is the following: keratinocyte cholesterol levels control inflammatory signaling in the skin.
In the first aim of the study, we will understand how HDL NP modulates keratinocyte cholesterol in the setting of
IL-17A activation. In the second aim, we will investigate IL-17A-dependent inflammatory signaling in
keratinocytes with a particular focus in measuring the expression of chemoattractants that are known to
perpetuate skin inflammation. In the final aim of the study, we will investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting
cholesterol modulation in vivo using the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like mouse model as a model of skin
inflammation. Project success will better delineate the role of cholesterol metabolism in inflammatory
skin disease to develop novel topical therapies to reduce inflammation."
10909786,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is highly prevalent among post-deployment Veterans. First
line evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for PTSD can be effective, but have limitations
including high attrition rates, due in part to lengthy treatment protocols, and continued diagnosis of
PTSD in a significant number of patients despite treatment completion. Alternate brain-based
treatments are thus being explored, like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS ), which
is useful for depression and shows promise for PTSD. rTMS involves applying a repetitive, brief
magnetic pulse to the scalp in order to safely modulate cortical neurons via the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex node, which is believed to improve control of cognition and emotions. Standard
rTMS treatments are stand-alone, though the unique properties of rTMS enhancing cognitive
control may make it more effective when added to an EBP for PTSD. A brief EBP for PTSD that is
effective in as few as five sessions with limited attrition is written exposure therapy (WET).
Integration of rTMS with WET could improve efficacy by improving emotional control-dependent
cognitive restructuring, which is believed to be WET’s mechanism of action. However, this
possibility has not been tested.
 The applicant, Dr. Lantrip, is a clinical neuropsychologist with expertise in brain -behavior
relationships. She has significant experience studying behavioral and neural regulatory processes
impacting mental health. Through her postdoctoral fellowship, she developed a theoretical
framework for understanding the emotion regulatory mechanisms contributing to symptom
improvement in rTMS for depression. She tested this theory in an rTMS clinical trial. Through her
current primary VA appointment at the VISN 17 Center of Excellence for Research on Returning
War Veterans, Dr. Lantrip has access to a large pool of Veterans with PTSD as well as to a
research-dedicated TMS machine. Further, Dr. Lantrip has established collaborations with external
researchers who are experts in rTMS treatment in Veterans and in WET. In short, Dr. Lantrip is in
an ideal position to conduct the necessary research to augment behavioral therapy for PTSD with
rTMS.
 In the proposed randomized controlled trial, Dr. Lantrip will compare active rTMS added to WET
with sham rTMS added to WET in [98] Veterans with PTSD. She will also determine the
mechanism of action of the treatment by determining if emotional flexibility is a mediator of
treatment outcome.
 In summary, this project will attempt to augment WET, a brief EBP for PTSD, by adding rTMS,
and it will also attempt to determine the emotion regulatory mechanism of action for symptom
improvement. If successful, this work will influence both clinical treatment and scientific
investigation of PTSD. This project will be of potentially great value to both patients and clinicians
within the VA by providing an effective, efficient treatment option for veterans with PTSD. This
treatment may also facilitate symptom improvement in transdiagnostic mental health disorders.
Upon successful completion of this project, Dr. Lantrip will apply for a VA Merit Review Award with
continued investigation into TMS-augmented behavioral intervention for trauma-related illness. By
providing Dr. Lantrip with mentored research time to conduct this study, this project will help Dr.
Lantrip achieve her goal of becoming an independent VA investigator."
10909918,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to determine how epigenetic pathways regulate plasticity in social behaviors
using the model ant Harpegnathos saltator. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that external social cues
are conveyed to chromatin by neuropeptides that regulate downstream transcription factors and associated
epigenetic pathways to enable stable changes in social behavior.
Epigenetic pathways are often disrupted in neurodevelopmental and behavioral disorders. Harpegnathos
ants are an ideal model system to study brain epigenetics because workers and queens have the same genes
but display distinct social behaviors. Furthermore, adult Harpegnathos workers can become queens via a
remarkable phenotypic transition that involves plastic changes in reproduction, metabolism, and behavior.
We have discovered that the ant homolog of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone, the neuropeptide
corazonin, is downregulated as Harpegnathos workers become queens and showed that it is necessary and
sufficient to stimulate hunting in workers. Our preliminary data show that vasopressin, a neuropeptide with
conserved social roles in mammals, is also preferentially expressed in worker brains, especially in those who
do not express high levels of corazonin. In Aim 1, we will determine whether these two neuropeptides act on
distinct or overlapping neuronal, molecular, and epigenetic pathways and whether they drive distinct social
behaviors.
Our previous work also revealed that Kr-h1, a transcription factor induced by corazonin, prevents unscheduled
activation of “socially inappropriate” genes in the brain, thereby maintaining proper social behavior in both
workers and gamergates. Preliminary studies identified another transcription factor, Fd3F, which is repressed
by corazonin and might promote social plasticity in opposition to Kr-h1. Fd3F shares homology with pioneer
transcription factors in other species, suggesting that an ability to reprogram chromatin states might underpin
its function in behavioral reprogramming. In Aim 2, we will identify the changes on transcription and chromatin
by which these transcription factors regulate brain and behavioral plasticity during adult caste transitions in
Harpegnathos.
The proposed experiments will leverage our previous experience with in vivo manipulation of gene expression
in ant brains followed by behavioral and functional genomics analyses. Given that the neuropeptides,
transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators investigated in this proposal are deeply conserved, our results
should have broad impact on our understanding of how these molecular processes regulate social behavior."
10910037,"The developing fetal immune system is exquisitely sensitive to signals from the maternal
environment. Maternal pre-pregnancy (pregravid) obesity has emerged as one of the most
consequential regulators of fetal health. Data from clinical and animal model studies
demonstrated increased susceptibility to microbial infection as well as a higher incidence of
inflammatory disorders and auto-immune diseases with maternal obesity. This dichotomy is
illustrated by splenocytes generating dampened inflammatory responses to LPS stimulation while
gut resident immune cells generate exaggerated ones. Similarly, pregravid obesity resulted in
lower expression of inflammatory genes in umbilical cord blood monocytes at rest, but following
differentiation into macrophages, expression of inflammatory genes was significantly increased.
These observations strongly suggest that pregravid obesity disrupts the development and
maturation of the fetal immune system and differentially impacts circulating monocytes
and tissue resident macrophages (TRMs). However, the molecular underpinnings of this
dysregulation by maternal obesity remain poorly understood due to the difficulty of obtaining term
fetal tissues and of controlling for multiple maternal variables that modulate fetal immunity. Thus,
in this application, we will leverage the rhesus macaque model to interrogate multiple fetal
compartments within the same subject to address this knowledge gap. Immune ontogeny occurs
via 3 different waves starting with yolk sac, transitioning to fetal liver, and finally the bone marrow.
TRMs are derived primarily from yolk sac and fetal liver while circulating monocytes are derived
from bone marrow. We recently reported that pregravid obesity is associated with low grade
inflammation that is further compounded by pregnancy. Thus, we postulate that exposure to low
grade maternal inflammation leads to “training” of TRMs while heightened maternal inflammatory
environment in late gestation leads to “tolerance” of bone marrow derived monocytes. Therefore,
this application will test the central hypothesis that pregravid obesity results in differential
rewiring of TRMs and circulating monocytes wherein TRMs are poised to generate a
heightened inflammatory response while circulating monocytes display a stunted
response. The novelty of this application lies in the systems biology approach integrating
maternal clinical metadata with genomic and functional readouts obtained in multiple immune
compartments in the same animal. Completion of the proposed experiments will reveal the
molecular mechanisms that result in altered fetal macrophage and monocyte functions thus
informing the potential development of early interventions."
10910038,"ABSTRACT
Sex and gender contribute to the immune system and how we as humans respond to foreign infections. Males
traditionally have an elevated risk of hospitalizations due to infections from birth to old age. Females, however,
have a more protective immune system, yet have an elevated risk of autoimmunity. Thus, the balance between
fighting infections and limiting immune response is stratified. Animal models have allowed us to largely tease
out the role of sex chromosomes and hormones (such as estrogen/testosterone), but they lend little insight into
the role of human gender on the immune response. Disparities between trans- and cis-gender women are
observed in multiple inflammatory and immune phenotypes, from HIV risk to rheumatological conditions. As
gender is a non-binary spectrum, many precision medicine tools can be applied to tease out individuals’
immune system modulators focused on individual assessments of sex chromosomes, sex hormones, and
environmental factors. To do this, we have compiled a multiple PI team that brings strengths from
epigenetics/epidemiology (Dr. Triche), infectious disease modeling (Dr. Krawczyk), and sex
chromosome/hormone genetics (Dr. Prokop). We highlight in this work how the histone methylation regulator
chromosome pair, KDM5C (chrX) and KDM5D (chrY), results in an immune modulation through genome-wide
epigenetic alteration.
We have developed three complementary aims to build an integrated model of KDM5C/KDM5D influence on
individuals’ immune responses. Aim1) Genetics of KDM5C hematopoiesis conditional knockout alteration at
the cellular resolution of the immune system following a chronic viral infection, allowing us to determine cell
types and global epigenetic alterations regulated by the pathway. Aim2) Precision insights for KDM5C/KDM5D
of ~20,000 human blood samples following various immune challenges and the separation of hormone and sex
chromosome using the four-core genotypes rodent model blood single-cell data generation. Aim3) Integrating
our knowledge to individuals for human variants, gene regulation, environmental modulation, and phenotypic
associations for KDM5C/KDM5D. The combination of the three aims represents a precision medicine
approach, allowing us insights into the cells and pathways impacted by the sex chromosome genes during
infection (Aim1), deconvolution of how hormones and sex chromosomes synergistically contribute to immune
cells (Aim2), defining the broad infections and signatures that modulate the genes (Aim2), and integrating this
knowledge to be applied to any individual in a non-binary approach (Aim3). As gender can never be binned
into groups, with an undefined spectrum of individuals within, we lay forth a novel, innovative way for thinking
about how sex and gender both contribute to immune systems without the need for defining gender but
allowing for individualized assessments."

The energy utilized by the heart for contractions is primarily made by aerobic respiration. This process consists
of oxidizing carbon substrates to fuel ATP synthesis. An essential substrate is oxygen which acts as the final
electron acceptor. Without oxygen, ATP is rapidly depleted from the myocardium. There are a number of
scenarios where the heart is exposed to hypoxic or anoxic conditions. Ischemia occurs when blood flow becomes
restricted preventing oxygen delivery to part of the muscle. This occurs in ischemic heart disease. If blood flow
is not restored in time, it can lead to irreversible damage, termed myocardial infarction. Organ transplantation is
another scenario where the heart is away from blood supply during transportation. The amount of time the muscle
is without oxygen determines the health of the tissue for the recipient. Situations such as these that involve an
ischemic environment induce metabolic changes that damage the myocardium during reperfusion when oxygen
is restored, known as ischemia-reperfusion injury. One such change is succinate accumulation. During
reperfusion, the immense amount of succinate is responsible for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production that
puts oxidative stress on cardiomyocytes. Another metabolic change seen during ischemia is the depletion of
adenine nucleotides. This group includes AMP, ADP, and ATP and are all essential energy carriers in the
myocardium. The depletion of these molecules results in impaired energy metabolism in the heart. Little is known
about the mechanisms behind these metabolic changes.
The goal of this project is to uncover the primary pathways of succinate accumulation and adenine nucleotide
depletion in ischemic myocardium. The working hypothesis is the combined actions of the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle, malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), and the purine nucleotide cycle (PNC) provide the substrate utilized
for succinate production and adenine nucleotides entering the PNC are shuttled into purine degradation
pathways. Experiments involving anoxic isolated heart mitochondrial, ischemic ex vivo hearts, and transgenic
rats will be used jointly with computational models of myocardial metabolism to test this hypothesis. The
metabolic states of these different systems will be quantified by metabolomics and enzyme inhibitors that will be
used to assess primary pathways of accumulation and depletion. Computational models will help with
experimental design, refining, and testing hypotheses. The data from this project will have applications for both
ischemic heart disease, organ transplantation, treatments for ischemia-reperfusion injury."

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a highly prevalent inherited cardiac disease, characterized by systolic
dysfunction, eccentric hypertrophy, and left ventricle dilation. While pharmacologic and mechanical treatments
have been shown to partially improve cardiac function, these results are often short lived and highly variable
from patient to patient. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic and matrix dysregulation
can persist, even in patients with improved systolic function after treatment. Given that aberrant chromatin
remodeling and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition have been identified as drivers of dilated remodeling—and
that chromatin and ECM remodeling can become irreversible over time—it is crucial to understand the time-
dependent effects of DCM mutations on reversing maladaptive remodeling at the genome, myocyte, and matrix
levels. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the reversibility of the DCM phenotype is time-dependent
due to the accumulation of permanent ECM and chromatin remodeling as the disease progresses. To complete
this proposal, I will utilize a DCM mouse model created by the Davis lab which contains a mutation (I61Q) in
cardiac troponin C (cTnC) that directly decreases the myofilament’s Ca2+ sensitivity, leading to eccentric
hypertrophy, systolic dysfunction, and left ventricle dilation. Importantly, expression of this mutant can be
temporally controlled with doxycycline to specifically test our central hypothesis. In this proposal I will 1)
Determine the time-dependent effects of I61Q cTnC expression on myocyte, matrix, and chromatin accessibility,
2) Examine the reversibility of DCM remodeling in myocyte, matrix, and chromatin accessibility at different stages
of the disease, and 3) Determine if myocytes retain epigenetic memories of the mechanical disequilibrium caused
by DCM. Improving our understanding of the time-dependent reversibility of DCM remodeling will better inform
therapeutic targets and treatment windows for patients with DCM. Moreover, completion of this project will
enhance Bella’s training as an independent scientist and prepare her to one day become a professor in
cardiovascular engineering. Receiving the NIH F31 predoctoral fellowship will facilitate important experiments
and training that will aid in her pursuit of this career goal. In this project, Bella will gain expertise in multi-omic
approaches—such as proteomics, RNAseq, and ATACseq—which are growing in popularity due to their
unbiased screening capabilities. The UW Genomics Core will assist Bella in learning how to effectively use these
tools, which will not only benefit this project but will also be an incredibly useful skillset for Bella’s future career.
Given the clinical relevance of this project, we have engaged Farid Moussavi-Harami, MD, an acting physician-
scientist who practices cardiology within the UW Department of Medicine. Dr. Moussavi-Harami’s input as a
clinician will be crucial for ensuring our research questions and aims remain relevant to patients, and his
mentorship throughout this project will enhance Bella’s training and career development as she aims to
eventually run a lab with an emphasis in translational therapeutics and technologies for cardiovascular diseases."

Cis-regulatory elements control Cell-type-specific gene regulation via looping with their targeting genes.
Therefore, mapping the 3D chromatin interactions between promoters and cis-regulatory elements will be pivotal
to understand the functions of regulatory regions. Besides, many genetic variants associated with
neuropsychiatric diseases reside in the putative cis-regulatory elements. They may contribute to disease by
affecting regulatory sequences function, but the exact mechanisms of how they contribute to diseases via gene
regulation remain unknown. Here, we aim to make substantial advances in understanding how the 3D
epigenome contributes to brain development and diseases by mapping and analyzing the dynamic changes
during the human prefrontal cortex development. We will first map transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, and
3D chromatin loops in six distinct cell types from the developing prefrontal cortex and perform an integrative
analysis to interrogate how chromatin interaction control gene expression and development. Second, we will
integrate the 3D epigenomic datasets with medical genetics resources to gain insights into cell types, genomic
loci, and biological pathways that are causal to diseases, link GWAS SNPs with their target genes. Third, to
establish cell-type-specific functional links between chromatin loops and target gene expression, we will test the
biological consequences of distal regulatory regions interacting with promoters in iPSC models and primary cells.
Our project will reveal new insight into the biological functions of the 3D epigenome in brain development and
diseases."
10922719,"Project Summary/Abstract
Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death for adolescents in the U.S. and non-lethal self-
injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB; e.g., suicide thoughts and attempts and non-suicidal
self-injury (NSSI)) are each associated with the risk of future suicide. Many adolescents at high
risk of suicide require psychiatric inpatient hospitalization. Unfortunately, these adolescents
often continue to think about suicide and engage in NSSI while they are hospitalized. Most
alarmingly, the month following hospitalization is the highest risk time for suicide, with the
suicide rate 10 times higher than the general adolescent rate. Research suggests that people
who engage in SITB show reduced implicit aversion toward SITB-related stimuli. This reduced
aversion may facilitate SITB because it means this natural barrier preventing people from
harming themselves is lower. People who engage in SITB also show increased implicit self-
aversion, which may also facilitate SITB by supporting beliefs that one deserves to be punished.
An intervention that reverses these potential facilitators of SITB may help prevent such thoughts
and behaviors. The goal of the current project is to test one such intervention: Therapeutic
Evaluative Conditioning (TEC), which aims to reduce SITB by increasing implicit aversion
toward SITB and reducing implicit aversion toward oneself. TEC uses evaluative condition, a
form of Pavlovian conditioning, in which, for example, SITB-related stimuli are paired with
naturally aversive stimuli (e.g., snakes) to increase implicit aversion towards SITB. In studies
among adults, TEC was associated with a 21-77% reduction in SITB over a month. The current
project aims to test whether TEC can reduce SITB among self-injurious adolescents (1) during
psychiatric inpatient hospitalization and (2) in the highest-risk period for suicide; the month after
hospital discharge. First, a pilot study will test whether TEC is feasible and acceptable as an
intervention for adolescents, both during and after inpatient hospitalization. Second, a
randomized controlled trial will compare an active form of TEC with an inactive, control form of
TEC. TEC has the potential to make broad impact reducing suicide because it is scalable, brief
(> 5 min to complete), low-burden, and easy to administer via mobile app on a smartphone.
Furthermore, in the post-discharge period, TEC can provide continuous therapeutic coverage,
filling the gap between discharge and patients’ first outpatient therapy session. It can also be
used to extend coverage in places where there are fewer resources for mental health care (e.g.,
rural areas). This proposal addresses the urgent need to reduce adolescent suicide, one of the
most devastating and widespread public health problems in the U.S. and around the world."
10917867,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Effective HIV treatment during pregnancy is critically important, both for the health of women living with HIV
(PWHIV) and for prevention of perinatal HIV transmission. In the United States, Nigeria, and globally,
Dolutegravir (DTG)- based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is being expanded as part of the preferred 1st-line ART
regimen, but emerging data show that DTG-based regimens are associated with excessive weight gain,
treatment-emergent obesity, and metabolic dysfunction in PWHIV. Excessive weight gain and metabolic
syndrome are critical during pregnancy because they increase the risk for pregnancy-related complications, such
as preterm birth, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, fetal obesity, macrosomia, low birth weight, Cesarean
delivery, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. Yet, the mechanisms by which DTG-based ART-cause
weight gain and metabolic syndrome in PWHIV are poorly understood, limiting our ability to fully deploy DTG-
based ART in this special population. To address this goal, we will leverage NIH infrastructure to conduct a
prospective cohort study at 4 sites in two countries (US and Nigeria). Within this cohort, we will first identify cases
of metabolic syndrome by examining the association between DTG-based ART regimens and metabolic
syndrome risk using the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III)
criteria for pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV, and cohort-specific percentiles for waist
circumference, systolic blood pressure, and serum glucose for their offspring. Subsequently, among PWHIV
diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (compared to controls), we will apply advanced integrated proteomic and
metabolomic targeted profiling techniques to measure maternal proteins and metabolites (during pregnancy and
postpartum) and umbilical cord blood proteins and metabolites to understand whether signature clusters of
proteins and metabolites differ between PWHIV diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (compared to selected
controls), and if any signature clusters are associated with adverse maternal and child metabolic health.
Biomarkers identified through integrated profiling would enhance the synergistic power of these ‘omics’
approaches to enable early detection of metabolic syndrome (even before clinical symptoms manifest), provide
insights into treatment efficacy and potential adverse effects, and contribute to the development of personalized
medicine strategies for PWHIV to guide the selection of interventions and therapies tailored to specific metabolite
profiles in clinical practice."
10921305,"ESKD patients residing in rural and remote geographic locations have higher mortality than patients closer to in-center hemodialysis clinics creating a serious and unacceptable health disparity. While home hemodialysis eliminates travel to in-center hemodialysis clinics, very few rural and remote patients perform home hemodialysis because it requires patients and caregivers to perform complicated tasks associated with life threatening risks. Furthermore, the large volume of dialysate (~120 liters) and the resources (high purity water and water filtration systems) to create dialysate severely limit home hemodialysis, especially for rural and remote ESKD patients. iHemo will enable more rural and remote ESKD patients to perform home hemodialysis therefore reducing long travel, missed treatments, and consequently eliminate the mortality health disparity plaguing rural and remote ESKD patients. In addition to iHemo's implanted HemoCartridge simplifying the tasks and significantly reducing the risks of home hemodialysis, the iHemo's zeolite-based external dialysate system will specifically enable both rural and remote ESKD patients to operate iHemo in resource limited environments because it requires as little as 2 liters of water per dialysate session. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of iHemo to eliminate the health disparity by achieving the following aims: Aim 1: Identify a zeolite with clinically acceptable urea adsorption capacity and Aim 2: Prototype the zeolite-enabled external dialysate system for integration with the implanted HemoCartridge."
10902691,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Establishing subcellular compartments and cell polarity requires asymmetric distribution of the proteome.
mRNA localization and onsite translation ensure that cells produce proteins at the right place and time, and this
regulation allows for asymmetric distribution of proteins for morphogenesis. In particular, the development,
maintenance, and function of neurons require posttranscriptional regulation as the complex and polarized
morphology necessitates the transport of mRNAs to neurites, which can be as long as a meter in animals.
Mutations in RNA binding proteins that regulate mRNA localization and onsite translation are associated with
neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal motor atrophy, and fragile X syndrome. In
these diseases, mutations in RNA binding proteins are also associated with abnormal neuron morphology.
Despite the knowledge that neuronal morphogenesis requires proper mRNA localization, the mechanistic link
between spatiotemporal regulation of mRNA and morphogenesis remains unknown.
This proposal investigates the mechanistic link between spatiotemporal regulation of mRNA and neuronal
remodeling during morphogenesis. I will take advantage of Drosophila mushroom body and dendritic
arborization neurons as models of developmental neuronal remodeling, where early neuronal connections
degenerate and neurites are refined. Specifically, I will investigate spatial and temporal regulation of the
chickadee (chic) transcript during regrowth of dendrites in Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization neurons
and mushroom body γ neurons. I hypothesize that during the neurite extension phase of neuronal remodeling
of these PNS and CNS neurons, respectively, chic mRNA localizes to branch emergence sites where its cohort
of protein interactors changes to anchor the transcript and to alter translation rates. First, I will characterize
chic localization and motility during neuronal remodeling using a novel Cas13-based method for live imaging.
Second, I will identify proteins interacting with chic mRNA during neuronal remodeling using a Cas13-based
method for RNA-centric proximity labeling. CRISPR/Cas13-based methods are an exciting, novel approach to
probe endogenous RNA in live organisms and unlike established methods of probing RNA, they do not perturb
the transcript sequences. CRISPR methods are generally very precise, and the family of Cas13 proteins I will
use is highly specific. The results of this proposal will elucidate the role of spatiotemporal regulation of mRNA
in the regulation of gene expression needed for neuronal outgrowth. Additionally, I will establish Cas13-based
methods that can be used for investigating RNA for other biological questions and in other organisms."
10927346,"Project Summary/Abstract. Clinical genomic sequencing (CGS) produces large amounts of data, much of
which is hard to characterize or may have a negligible influence on health. The concept of actionability is
commonly used to help separate information that may be useful from information that is likely irrelevant for
patients. Actionability directs attention to whether genomic information warrants action and reflects its initial
development as a strategy to augment diagnosis and treatment in sick patients. As CGS expands towards
healthy populations in primary care settings, actionability is still widely embraced despite little consensus
regarding its definition and use. Because this ambiguity could become an obstacle to the successful
implementation of clinical genomic sequencing in healthy populations, greater clarity about this concept is
necessary. The proposed research will fulfill this need by characterizing the emergence and varied meanings
of actionability in clinical genomics, focusing on clinical genomics' transition into primary care settings. By
identifying underlying values and assumptions related to actionability, this research will push beyond
definitional disputes and provide a deeper framework for assessing how genetic information is valued. The
specific aims are: 1. Identify and characterize, through in-depth interviews, how genomics experts and primary
care providers conceptualize what makes genomic information actionable for healthy populations. 2. Identify
and characterize, through a natural language processing (NLP) analysis of published literature, how the
concept of actionability emerged, spread, and is used throughout clinical genomics. 3. Convene a workshop
with genomics experts, primary care providers, and ELSI scholars to produce a white paper on actionability
and the ethical, effective integration of CGS into primary care, guided by the results from Aims 1 and 2. This
K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award includes a highly-structured, mentored training program that will
support the candidate's goal to become an independent, mixed-methods ELSI investigator focused on
assessing the value of genomic information. To achieve this career goal, the candidate will: 1. Receive training
in genetic and genomic science to facilitate collaboration with genomics care teams and make scientifically
accurate policy recommendations 2. Build new methodological skills in biomedical informatics and natural
language processing to conduct generalizable research 3. Publish and engage with scientific and medical
audiences to have a more direct impact on future guidelines and policies. 4. Develop a collaborative and
interdisciplinary research network. This training will include coursework, guided readings, network building, and
sustained mentorship by a highly-qualified team of faculty with expertise in ELSI research, bioethics, clinical
genomics, biomedical informatics, and the history and sociology of medicine. This training will prepare the
candidate to transition to an independent ELSI investigator focused on ethical issues related to the actionability
of genomic health information – an ELSI research priority in Genetic and Genomic Healthcare."
10927352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in U.S. men. There are approximately 1
million prostate biopsy (Bx) performed annually in the U.S. Almost all Bx are performed as an office based
procedure in under 15 minutes. The precision of Bx has improved over the last decade with the introduction of
MRI guidance/targeting of suspicious lesions within the prostate. However, significant limitations remain with
this approach, including a significantly increasing risk of post-Bx infection. This arises because more than 97%
of all prostate Bx are performed via a transrectal (TR) approach that introduces rectal bacteria with each pass
of the Bx needle into the sterile urinary tract. The current risk of post-TR Bx infection, even with antimicrobial
prophylaxis, is high at approximately 7% overall with 3% (30,000 men) requiring hospitalization annually.
Transperineal (TP) Bx is an alternate approach that eliminates the direct introduction of bacteria from the
rectum to the prostate. This approach, which is perfomed without antimicrobial prophylaxis, instead passes the
Bx needle through the perineal skin and pelvic floor. TP Bx has not been widely adopted for several reasons.
Historically, it has been considered too painful for patients in the clinic and thus was traditionally performed
under general anesthesia. The added time, inconvenience and cost has limited its national adoptance.
Second when TR Bx was initially adopted over 40 years ago, antibiotic resistance of rectal flora was not a
challenge. Beyond the potential for in-office TP Bx to significantly reduce or eliminate Bx infections, TP Bx may
also improve cancer detection as studies of TP Bx (performed under general anesthesia) demonstrate
higher detection rates for prostate cancer, particularly for anterior zone tumors, compared to TR Bx.
This is notable as anterior tumors are difficult to sample with TR Bx. Anterior tumors are also twice as likely to
occur in African American men. In fact, our research demonstrates that some of the outcomes disparities in
African American men may stem from an underdiagnosis of anterior prostate cancers. Although TR Bx is
used widely, it is associated with a significant and increasing risk of Bx infections due to growing
antibiotic resistance, highlighting the urgent need for a safer alternative approach to prostate Bx.
 We have refined a TP Bx approach under local anesthesia with MRI-targeting/guidance without
the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. We hypothesize that TP MRI targeted Bx will: (1) largely eliminate
post-Bx infections and costly hospitalizations for urosepsis; (2) be performed in the office with similar
discomfort and non-infectious complications compared to TR MRI targeted Bx; and (3) have significantly
better detection of prostate cancer. A multi-center randomized controlled trial will be conducted to
evaluate in-office TP MRI targeted vs. TR MRI targeted Bx, the current gold standard. This has transformative
impact to change current standard of practice. The investigators have a track record for collaboration. The
environment comprises 4 high-volume, SPORE funded centers of excellence that serve diverse populations."
10924885,"For over a decade and a half, Dr. Dracheva, the Principal Investigator (PI), has strategically centered her work
on uncovering the molecular underpinnings of central nervous system (CNS) disorders common among U.S.
military Veterans. These encompass psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as major depression disorder
(MDD) and suicide, schizophrenia (SZ), opioid addiction, as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
spinal cord injury. The existing treatments for these disorders are extremely limited and often ineffective for a
large subset of patients, hence there is a strong need to advance our understanding of their biological basis to
develop novel more efficacious medications. The essence of the PI’s approach lies in deciphering how genetic
and epigenetic mechanisms orchestrate gene expression in the healthy brain and identifying malfunctions
leading to disorders. Her multidisciplinary research integrates insights from genetics, epigenetics, molecular
biology, neural development, and evolution.
 The PI’s research has made significant contributions to the field, both conceptually and
methodologically. For example, her studies identified unique molecular markers associated with suicide, that
are distinct from those related to underlying psychiatric conditions, e.g., MDD or bipolar disorders. She also
discovered a unique human component to vulnerability towards opioid addiction, highlighting the limitations of
animal models and underscoring the necessity of studying opioid addiction in the human brain, as practiced in
her laboratory. These findings are particularly relevant to U.S. Veterans, who exhibit significantly higher rates of
suicide and opioid overdose mortality compared to civilians. Methodologically, her lab champions cell-type-
specific experimental methods, considering the brain's cellular diversity. This innovative strategy deepens our
understanding of disease mechanisms and the complexities of brain disorders. The PI’s pioneering methods
and insights have been adopted by numerous laboratories, leading to high-impact collaborative research.
 In this application, the PI seeks a VA BLR&D Research Career Scientist (RCS) Award based on her
important contributions to research, collaborations, training, editorial work, and administration, both inside and
outside the VA. Her accomplishments are evident from a steady stream of publications in reputable journals,
grant awards (VA Merit and NIH grants), mentorships, membership in editorial boards (Science Reports,
Frontiers in Pharmocol, and Frontiers in Neuroscience), ad hoc reviewer’s assignments for numerous journals,
intramural committee appointments at her VA, and extramural work as a grant reviewer for VA, NIH, and
foundations. Dr. Dracheva is a founding member of the PsychEncode Consortium that generates large scale
transcriptional and epigenetic data on tissues and cells from healthy and diseased human postmortem brains,
including from patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), MDD, and SZ, which are highly prevalent in
U.S. Veterans. These data are shared with the scientific community to accelerate the discoveries on the
molecular pathophysiology of these disorders.
Impact: To the best of our knowledge, the PI’s current VA Merit grants are the first studies to elucidate the role
of microglia in pathophysiology of MDD and to identify brain cell-type-specific markers associated with a slower
progression of ALS. Her future research efforts in the VA include investigating the molecular basis of opioid
addiction at a single cell level and dysregulation of DNA hydroxymethylation in the brain of suicide victims. The
RCS Award will enable PI to broaden her research scope and establish new collaborations. These research
efforts will significantly enhance our comprehension of the neurobiology of brain disorders, and more
importantly, pave the way for the discovery of innovative therapeutic targets, thereby addressing the prevailing
brain disorders among Veterans with greater efficacy."
10924884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic instability, induced by DNA damage, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of many major human
diseases, such as neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, together with aging. A critical need
exists for automated assays that can assess DNA damage and thereby bring the measurement of such damage
into greater routine use, which will help advance our understanding of disease and its environmental causes.
The comet assay, a widely used and versatile means of measuring many types of DNA damage, has been
integrated into various regulatory guidelines for screening chemicals and pharmaceuticals e.g., the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines, the European Commission’s Registration, Evaluation
and Authorization of Chemicals Program, and ICH S2(R1) guidance 16. Moreover, its use has far-reaching
recommendations e.g., the FDA, the National Toxicology Program, the European Food Safety Authority; the
International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Human Use; and the European
Medicines Agency.
 However, the comet assay is time-consuming and labor intensive (multiple steps and multiple sample
slides processed individually by hand), downsides which can also introduce errors and variation and be
problematic for users. These limitations can be addressed by assay automation, a workflow solution that is
currently absent in the market. Our Phase I project resulted in a novel, prototype Automated High-Throughput
Comet Assay Device (AHTP-CAD) that successfully automated the comet assay without the need for operator
involvement. A Technology Niche Analysis subsequently confirmed the demand, and identified potential markets.
 In this Phase II application, we will refine, optimize, and test the AHTP-CAD for benchtop use and
widespread adoption. We will develop manufacturing/assembly processes and procedures for scaling up to high
volume production. We will also benchmark and assess the operation of the AHTP-CAD to support users in
performing their assays in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice. At the project completion, we expect a
commercialization-ready device, which will uniquely address the unmet need of providing users with a
standalone, automated analysis of DNA damage. The device will be sufficiently developed for demonstration to
potential commercial partners.
 The availability of such a self-contained benchtop device will accelerate biomedical discovery and
address the NIH mission of seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and
the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability."
10924427,"Background. Veteran access to an assessment of day-to-day function is vital to enable aging-in-place. Older
Veterans are more likely to have dementia, which results in progressive functional decline requiring caregiver
assistance. While early assessment of day-to-day function is critical to preventing functional losses due to
dementia, Veterans face barriers to a functional assessment due to rurality or difficulty traveling to the clinic.
The gold standard of functional assessment involves observing Veterans completing a day-to-day task such as
tooth brushing or medication management. While telehealth increases Veteran access to care, video has not
been used to assess Veteran daily life function, particularly for those at highest risk of disability and functional
decline.
Specific Aims and Method. We will develop and pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of an assessment of
Veteran day-to-day function adapted for VA Video Connect (VVC). The target population is older Veterans
(age ≥65) with a diagnosis of dementia receiving dementia care at VA Bedford HCS and their caregivers. This
will be accomplished over two aims:
Aim 1. Develop protocol for assessment of Veteran day-to-day function adapted for VVC delivery.
We will identify assessments of Veteran daily life function applicable to dementia and develop protocols for
VVC delivery. We will then seek feedback on preliminary protocols via stakeholder interviews, utilizing rapid
analysis to gather themes that inform further adaptation to protocols. This will be achieved via two sub-aims:
Aim 1a. Identify and develop protocols for VVC delivery of day-to-day tasks. We will select ADL tasks (e.g.,
tooth brushing) and Instrumental ADL tasks (e.g., medication management) from assessment batteries utilized
in dementia care, based on criteria such as feasibility for VVC delivery. We will develop protocols including
step-by-step instructions for video delivery of the task-based assessments.
Aim 1b. Adapt VVC protocols based on input from stakeholders, namely, interviews with experts in dementia,
tele-rehabilitation, and caregivers. Interview topics will include protocol structure, content, and dementia
relevance. VVC protocols for day-to-day tasks will be further adapted based on stakeholder input.
Aim 2. Pilot test and gather the feasibility and acceptability of day-to-day tasks adapted for VVC delivery
with 20 community-dwelling Veterans with dementia and their caregivers (N=40), and based on feedback,
finalize VVC protocols for tasks. Feasibility and acceptability will be gathered through semi-structured
interviews with participating Veteran-caregiver dyads, satisfaction surveys completed by the assessor and the
dyad, and visit field notes and session checklists completed by the assessor and a trained observer, and will
include domains such as technological challenges, ability to see and hear during the assessment, and session
duration. We will also gather baseline Veteran-caregiver data to inform our subsequent trial. Based on
synthesized data, we will select tasks for which we will refine VVC protocols.
Impact. This project will develop and pilot test assessments of Veteran day-to-day function adapted for VVC
delivery to Veterans with dementia and their caregivers. Increasing Veteran access to functional assessment
allows for more targeted intervention, which may minimize the cascading effects of dementia and disability-
related deficits to Veterans, caregivers, and VHA, thereby aligning with RR&D’s mission to maximize Veterans’
functional independence. Data from this project will inform development of a fully-telehealth version of the
evidence-based dementia program, Tailored Activities Program (TAP) in a future MERIT."

Innovative and transformational training schemes that motivate the next generation of scientists are needed to
increase the numbers of highly trained PhD investigators and MD physician-researchers in kidney, urology, or
non-malignant hematology (KUH) research. UAB KURE was established in 2018 with recruitment of our first
cohort in 2019 to address this need. The University of Alabama at Birmingham KUH Undergraduate Research
Experience (UAB KURE) R25 program builds confidence and understanding in hands-on research skills and
knowledge of physiological systems in a thriving KUH research environment at UAB. The UAB KURE R25
program has developed professional and career development sessions focused on building confident leaders in
biomedical KUH research. UAB KURE scholars engage in an immersive short-term research training program
with basic to translational hands-on mentored projects, didactic workshops, and clinical experiences with expert
PhD and MD role models in KUH research themes to demystify the complexities of inter-disciplinary KUH
physiology and pathophysiology. The UAB KURE program also exposes undergraduate scholars to
communication and leadership skills through professional development sessions in building confidence to be
leaders in biomedical research. The UAB KURE program utilizes an integrated faculty and near peer team
mentoring approach. It is imperative that faculty mentors engage with the scholars to provide inspiration and
guidance. Moreover, it is well-established that exposure to near peer (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows)
mentorship during influential times in the undergraduate scholar training is key in later career decisions of the
scholars. To optimize near peer mentoring, we initiated a pilot KURE Near Peer Mentoring Academy in 2022.
The Mentoring Academy promoted confidence in near peer mentoring for KURE 2023 as well as in the near
peers' own career development. Furthermore, surveys and focus groups of faculty and near peer mentors
provided key insights to establish best practices for ongoing mentoring of KURE scholar alumni to enhance
opportunities in KUH-focused careers. The mission of the UAB KURE program renewal is to inspire, motivate,
and develop future KUH researchers from diverse backgrounds and experience through an immersive short-
term KUH research and professional development activities. Two specific aims guide the UAB KURE program
renewal. Aim 1 will identify, recruit, and engage a diverse (by race/ethnicity, rural/urban hometowns, scientific
experience, undergraduate institution) cohort of undergraduate students focusing on an immersive summer
research program in the development of inter-disciplinary strategies, critical thinking skills, scientific rigor, and
clinical knowledge in KUH themes at UAB. Aim 2 will develop and nurture an integrated faculty and near peer
mentoring strategy to enrich KURE scholars in communication and leadership skills as well as provide ongoing
mentoring to KURE alumni to enhance future KUH career opportunities."
10915879,"Background: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) and depression are the two most common causes of disability in
America. When they occur together, patients have more functional limitations, higher healthcare spending, and
treatment is more likely to fail. Ideal treatments would address pain interference with function and improve
mood in patients with both CLBP and depression. Ketamine is an anesthetic with rapid analgesic and
antidepressant properties. Unfortunately, its effect for both pain and depression fades over time, necessitating
maintenance dosing. Thus, non-invasive treatments that enhance and sustain its benefits are needed.
Significance/Impact: This application proposes a career training and research plan to develop a narrative
intervention designed to be administered shortly after a series of ketamine infusions, conduct initial pilot
testing, and complete a small feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT). A narrative intervention, [designed
to be delivered in the days after receiving ketamine,] could be particularly helpful [in reducing pain
interference] for patients in whom formal psychotherapy may not be acceptable. Narrative interventions reduce
distress by helping people organize difficult experiences (such as chronic illness) into a cohesive story; this
process results in the perception that the experience is more manageable. Commonly used in palliative care,
narrative interventions have demonstrated effectiveness for both pain and depression and are highly
acceptable. This research agenda is well-aligned with the Clinical Science Research and Development priority
research focus on both chronic pain treatment alternatives to opioids and mental health conditions highly
prevalent in Veterans (e.g., depression). Short-term, results will lead to a Merit Review proposal to test the
intervention in an adequately powered RCT. Long-term, Dr. Powell will gain skills broadly applicable to (a)
complex intervention development (e.g., those combining pharmacologic and behavioral components) and (b)
designing and conducting high quality clinical trials of these treatments in Veterans with chronic illnesses. Dr.
Powell is a VHA palliative care physician and research scientist whose long-term goal is to become an
independent investigator focused on improving outcomes for Veterans with chronic pain and psychosocial
distress.
Innovation: This study will be the first to test a narrative intervention as a strategy for enhancing ketamine’s
benefits, with an emphasis on pain interference with function. It focuses on Veterans with both CLBP and
depression – a population that stands to benefit from ketamine’s analgesic and antidepressant actions.
Specific Aims: Study Phase I aims to develop and refine a targeted narrative intervention for Veterans with
CLBP and co-occurring depression using a modified ADAPT-ITT approach. The initial aim involves the
identification of relevant components of existing narrative interventions followed by semi-structured
interviews with Veterans and clinicians to obtain detailed feedback. Next, an open-label pilot involving a series
of ketamine infusions followed by the narrative intervention will assess initial feasibility and barriers, allowing
protocol refinement. Study Phase II will consist of a 2-arm pilot RCT with a control group who does not receive
the narrative intervention [(n=22 participants/group)].
Deliverables from Aims: Two manuscripts per aim are anticipated. Importantly, this work will facilitate sample
size calculations to inform an adequately powered RCT to be submitted as a Merit proposal (Year 4). This RCT
will investigate the impact of the intervention upon the primary outcome - pain interference with function. Dr.
Powell will work with her mentorship team to disseminate findings and strategically implement this work to
maximize benefits for Veterans."
10916607,"Veterans with cancer are susceptible to muscle wasting disorders including both cachexia (chronic
disease related) and sarcopenia (age related). The cumulative effect of this muscle wasting is both poor
response to cancer treatments and high risk of physical disability. Unfortunately, clinical trials for cancer related
cachexia have encountered several barriers, including lack of precise diagnosis and classification of true
muscle wasting in cancer patients. Current approaches to cachexia diagnosis include body weight and indirect
body composition measures via imaging modalities. However, these approaches are flawed, lack specificity to
muscle, and do not correlate well with physical functional outcomes. D3-creatine (D3-Cr) has recently emerged
as novel biomarker of functional skeletal muscle mass and correlates well with muscle and functional
outcomes in patients with age-related sarcopenia. Thus, D3-creatine has been suggested as a power tool for
estimating muscle mass for future clinical trials, including in cancer patients. However, D3-creatine has not
been specifically tested in the context of cancer muscle wasting, and others have postulated that the
relationship between D3-creatine and total muscle mass is confounded by muscle wasting pathology, including
cachexia and sarcopenia. Further study of D3-creatine is needed at the pre-clinical level before it can be
applied broadly in the cancer population.
 The major scientific goal in this study is to determine the specific utility of D3-Cr in predicting
muscle wasting and function in the context of cachexia, sarcopenia, and both during cancer. Using our
novel longitudinal pre-clinical mouse model of cancer-associated cachexia, in Aim 1, we will compare D3-Cr
levels in mature animals (20 weeks old) with and without cancer cachexia. We will then correlate D3-Cr levels
with physiologic cross-sectional area (PCSA) of an array of lower extremity muscles as well as physical
function. Function will be assessed using grip strength, treadmill time to fatigue, and maze-based assays for
assessing gait speed and cognitive function. We hypothesize that D3-Cr levels will strongly correlate with
PCSA and physical function measures in cancer animals. In Aim 2, we will assess D3-Cr levels, PCSA, and
physical function in aged animals (90 weeks old) with and without cancer cachexia. We again hypothesize that
D3-Cr levels will strongly correlate with PCSA and physical function measures in aged cancer animals.
However, we also hypothesize that in a two-way ANOVA of cancer and age, that there will be a significant
association between D3-CR and the interaction of these two variables.
 By completing this pre-clinical work, we will establish the specific pathologic conditions related to
cancer in which D3-Cr may be used to predict muscle wasting. More directed future clinical studies can then be
designed for the application of D3-Cr as a biomarker of cancer related muscle wasting."
10916608,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder affecting cognitive/functional abilities, including
ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Globally, >47M individuals live with dementia, with new
incidence of 7.7M annually. Progressive symptoms include memory loss, loss of motor skills, difficulty
sequencing ADL subtasks, and lack of motivation for task initiation. Interestingly, many key ADLs are directly
associated with water access, providing an opportunity for targeted tech to improve accessibility & compliance.
For example, medication mismanagement is a common and concerning risk factor in people with dementia
(PwD), as it leads to undertreatment of disease, emergency room visits, hospital admissions/readmissions, &
serious adverse events. In the U.S., 3M older adults are admitted to nursing homes due to drug-related
adherence problems with annual cost exceeding $14B. Other water-based ADL challenges including drinking,
showering, cooking, grooming, & hair washing. Keeping older adults aging at home is challenging, as caregivers
are not available 24/7 & external care costs can be prohibitive.
 The Active-H2O smart faucet, being developed by Nasoni, LLC, will solve these challenges by intelligent
sensor integration, automated flow/pressure/temperature adjustment, intuitive task reminders and control
algorithms, & a connected, cloud architecture to improve independent living for PwD. The smart faucet design
delivers water through either traditional downward spout, upward fountain delivery, or extended height for hair
washing allowing a single faucet to be used by all in a household. System design will integrate a sensor suite
(proximity, speaker, & camera) calibrated based on individual need. Intelligent algorithms will remind users to
complete ADL’s, provide step by step guidance, and automatically activate & adjust faucet
position/flow/pressure/temperature for given task. Additionally, computer vision will confirm task completion,
assist users with task guidance, and monitor compliance.
 The project will build on an existing Nasoni faucet targeted to individuals impacted by spinal cord injury, in
which a technical foundation including flow control & sensors have been designed/prototyped, control algorithms
verified, & validated for usability. This Phase II project will modify the faucet with features to specifically support
water-based ADLs in PwD. First, faucet form factor will be enhanced with adjustable height & water pressure to
support an array of tasks including hydration, grooming, hair washing, & medication management. Next,
intelligent algorithms using computer vision will be developed and validated for detecting ADL intention,
dynamically adjusting faucet parameters, and capturing user ADL compliance. Once the platform is validated in
an early pilot usability study, the design will be scaled for manufacturing, transferred to quality system production,
and tested per compliance and regulatory standards. Finally, a first article production run of devices will be
evaluated in field efficacy study."
10929736,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Portal hypertension (PHTN) is a common final pathway of multiple forms of chronic liver disease which
accounts for significant morbidity and mortality among patients with liver disease. However, there is a paucity
of therapies available to ameliorate PHTN. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the
contribution of neutrophils and platelets to the pathogenesis of PHTN, with the therapeutic goal of facilitating
the design of therapies to decrease portal pressure. The pathophysiology of PHTN is complex and is regulated
at multiple levels, including paracrine signaling within sinusoids, formation of microvascular thrombosis, and
endothelial dysfunction. We have previously identified a novel but critical role of neutrophils in the
pathogenesis of PHTN. We found that cyclic stretch imposed by congestive hepatopathy (CH) induces
activation of mechanosensitive Piezo channels within liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Piezo
channels activate mechanocrine signaling pathways which culminate in secretion of the neutrophil chemotactic
cytokine CXCL1. CXCL1 induces infiltration of neutrophils into liver sinusoids. Neutrophils form complexes with
platelets which lead to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, or NETs. We found that genetic and
pharmacologic inhibition of NET formation significantly decreases portal pressures in murine models of CH and
PHTN. Although platelets have been implicated in NET formation in certain settings, the mechanisms which
recruit platelets and regulate their interactions with neutrophils to generate sinusoidal NETs require further
investigation. Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) are endothelial organelles which generate extracellular vesicles
(EVs) containing inflammatory and hemostatic factors. The impact of WPB-derived EVs on platelet recruitment
to liver sinusoids has not been studied. We have formulated the central hypothesis that platelets activated by
WPB-derived EVs interact with the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor on neutrophils to stimulate NET formation
and PHTN. We will test this hypothesis through the following independent but integrated specific aims which
are both technically and conceptually innovative. First, we will test the hypothesis that Piezo channels
serve as master mechanosensors whose activation regulates the generation of both neutrophil- and platelet-
chemotactic factors which modulate portal pressures. We propose that Piezo activation generates platelet
chemotactic factors within EVs derived from WPBs in LSECs. Finally, using murine models and clinically-
relevant forms of platelet inhibition, we will test the hypothesis that interaction of the neutrophil integrin receptor
CD11b/CD18 with the platelet glycoprotein receptor GPIbα drives NET formation. Our proposal is significant
because it has the potential to elucidate novel therapeutic targets to better manage PHTN, a devastating and
prevalent disease which is currently curable only with liver transplantation."
10929738,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that impacts over 3 million people, causing
joint pain, organ damage, and impaired quality of life. Existing SLE drugs are non-specific and cause side
effects. With NIAID Fast-Track U44 support, we will test a new cell therapy technology as a safe and potent
treatment for SLE. The goal of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is to eliminate pathogenic
cells by engineering CARs to bind antigens on a target cell. This involves isolation and engineering of patient
T cells to express CAR, followed by reinfusion. All approved CAR-T therapies rely on transfection of T cells
with DNA that permanently modifies the genome and requires proliferation for efficacy. For these cells to
thrive and expand, patients must first be admitted to the hospital to receive preconditioning chemotherapy.
Beyond these burdens, permanent CAR expression resulting from DNA engineering causes unconstrained
proliferation and toxicity that drive costs as high as $2.0M. These hurdles have limited CAR-T cell treatment
only to advanced refractory cancers. We have designed a new approach for CAR-T using RNA to achieve
transient CAR expression (rCAR-T). These cells do not require proliferation, instead relying on rapid depletion
of target cells as CAR expression decays during cell division. This feature limits toxicity, eliminating
preconditioning chemotherapy and inpatient stays. Thus, rCAR-T creates a unique opportunity to expand cell
therapy to autoimmunity. We have engineered cells with rCAR-T to bind B cell maturation antigen (BCMA),
an antigen on the plasma cells (PCs) that secrete the pathogenic autoantibodies characteristic of many
autoimmune diseases. This therapy – “Descartes-08” – transiently expresses anti-BCMA CAR to eliminate
BCMA+ PCs after infusion without inducing serious toxicity. In a Phase 2a trial (NCT04146051), Descartes-
08 conferred potent, safe, and long-lasting improvement in patients with Myasthenia Gravis, an autoantibody
associated autoimmune disorder (AAAD) in which PCs produce autoantibodies targeting neuromuscular
junctions. Since BCMA+ PCs also produce the autoantibodies that attack ubiquitous nuclear antigens in SLE,
here we will test if Descartes-08 provides safe, effective, and durable treatment of SLE. In July 2023 the FDA
allowed our IND for SLE; we have initiated a Phase 2a open label trial in patients with SLE (NCT06038474).
In SBIR Phase 1, we will use data from this trial to finalize design of a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase
2b trial (RCT) for SLE that will be executed in SBIR Phase 2. The aims are: i) Finalize the design and operating
procedures for the Phase 2b Descartes-08 RCT in SLE, ii) Show Descartes-08 drives clinical benefit, reduced
autoantibodies, & phenotypic changes in RCT, and iii) Show the safety and tolerability of Descartes-08 in
patients with SLE during the Phase 2b RCT. This plan is aligned with the U44 Cooperative Mechanism
requirements because Descartes-08 has not been tested in SLE, our plans includes a strong mechanism
element, and we have worked closely with NIAID (DAIT) staff and completed a site visit to prepare this U44."
10921741,"There is a critical need for accurate and safe early stage detection of, e.g., infectious diseases, hazardous materials, and other
health related issues. Remote detection directly from surfaces, especially related to health concerns (in situ, in vivo) is an
underserved area of immense utility. Thus, significant commercial opportunities exist because of the dearth of these
capabilities as “demonstrated” in the current double pandemics of Covid and drugs as well as persistent threats (bacterial,
fungi, cancers, bioagents, etc.). Mass spectrometry (MS), because of its ability to detect hundreds of biological compounds
in a single acquisition provides the capability to distinguish chemical differences associated with, e.g., different pathogens
and disease states, as well as target specific compounds in or on surfaces or within compositions (e.g., drugs from Skittles),
as examples. Current MS approaches use ionization methods requiring user expertise and frequently specialized
instrumentation, which significantly increases cost. Over the past 30 years, mass spectrometers have undergone a
renaissance in their cost-to-capability ratio. For more widespread applications of MS in advancing healthcare, there is a
need for new advanced direct sampling / ion source technology that provides for minimal user intervention and long-term
use without maintenance. These attributes are necessary if testing of hundreds of individual surfaces daily per instrument to
e.g., identify, track, and contain the spread of infectious agents, or to detect cancer in biopsied tissue or cancer boundaries
during surgery is to be implemented using MS in the future. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate
that an entirely new sampling device-transfer-ionization approach constitutes a disruptive technology and effective method
that can be used for the next-generation disease detection and health management. The basic invention of this project is
covered by two MSTM provisional patent applications (April 3 and June 5, 2023), and earlier IP from inventors Trimpin
(CEO of MSTM) and McEwen (President of MSTM) exclusively licensed from two universities to MSTM. In summary,
these developments and remote sampling research position MSTM well for advancing this exciting area in need of new
technology. Critical advantages include exceptional ease and flexibility, on the fly results, remote sampling of 3-
dimensional surfaces without and with the use of a laser, robustness to instrument contamination and carryover, and the
capability to retrofit with commercial atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometers to provide accurate, safe,
detection on demand. The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility and proof-of-concept of the
surface reader to sample surfaces directly with a liquid meniscus or indirectly by laser ablation. In Phase II, an FDA
approved CO2 laser will be implemented along with machine learning algorithms in a commercial product requiring little
expertise to effectively operate. Aim 1: Build a proof-of-concept remote surface reader interfaced with an MSTM multiport
inlet using SAI and VSAI MS for differentiation of diseased vs. normal tissue through computer aided m/z fingerprint
recognition. Aim 2: Test the remote transfer device of Aim 1 using real samples for demonstration and Phase II purposes.
MSTM has the necessary expertise and facilities to bring this Phase I project to a successful conclusion within 12 months.
MSTM has enlisted help from knowledgeable companies (letters Advion, Bruker, Medtronic, Thermo, BioPharmaSpec)."
10920609,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Vaginal Atrophy (VA), a component of Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause, is a chronic and progressive
condition that affects approximately 50% of post-menopausal women due to estrogen deficiency. Without
treatment, symptoms such as vaginal dryness, burning, discharge, itching, irritation, painful intercourse, and
recurrent urinary tract infections worsen over time. This results in an adverse impact on the quality of life, sexual
health, and emotional well-being of affected women. About 1.1 billion women worldwide are projected to be in
menopause by 2030. In the United States, 50 million women are currently in menopause and approximately 2.2
million women are projected to enter menopause yearly. Therefore, given the growing population of post-
menopausal women, many women are potentially at risk for VA.
The first-line pharmacologic treatment recommended for VA is vaginal estrogen therapy. However, despite its
effectiveness, most women refuse hormonal therapy due to concerns about side effects associated with
estrogen therapies, such as thromboembolic disorders, dementia, and cancer. Alternatives such as vaginal
lubricants and moisturizers usually provide only short-term relief, and do not treat the underlying condition. In
addition, though non-ablative laser or thermal intra-vaginal devices may be effective, they are relatively
expensive and are not FDA-approved for treatment of VA due to a insufficient safety and efficacy data.
Our company, Moremmé, is developing a patent-pending combination of hormone-free natural bioactives
loaded in a novel prebiotic mucoadhesive gel delivery system for intravaginal drug delivery. These bioactives
synergistically address key symptoms of VA by hydrating and repairing the vaginal wall while keeping the vaginal
microbiome in homeostasis. We demonstrate that within a range of effective concentrations, our formulations
are non-toxic to cultured human vaginal cells and promote production of proteins that help rebuild the vaginal
wall. The overall objective of this proposal is to test and establish the efficacy of our formulations in
reversing signs of VA in vivo. To achieve this, Aim 1 will optimize bioactive loading and release from the gel
formulations. Aim 2 will assess safety and tolerability of the optimized formulation prototypes using a 3-D human
vaginal tissue model, while Aim 3 will determine efficacy of the formulations in reversing signs of VA in a rodent
model. Upon successful completion of this Phase I project, we will have optimized loading and release of
bioactives from the gel matrix, determined formulation tolerability in human vaginal tissues, and established
effectiveness in treatment of VA in vivo. This work will provide preliminary data and proof of concept to support
a future Phase II SBIR application for product development and commercialization activities for a hormone-free
vaginal suppository for treatment of VA in post-menopausal women. This will ultimately offer a viable alternative
for millions of aging women who desire a safe, effective, and hormone-free alternative for treatment of VA."
10920797,"Project Summary / Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor with no known cure. GBM is
projected to account for almost 14,500 new cases and approximately 10,000 deaths in the United States (U.S.)
in 2023. The prognosis for patients afflicted with GBM is incredibly poor, with a median survival of
approximately 8 months and less than 5% of patients surviving 5 years.
Although therapies for GBM exist, these poor outcomes are a direct testament to the treatment challenges.
The difficulty in treating GBM is due to several factors. 1) Treatments must cross the blood brain barrier (BBB)
- this constrains the molecular properties of prospective drug candidates. 2) Treatments must be agnostic to
cell type so GBM cells are preferentially targeted over healthy cells. 3) GBM tumors often contain a population
of glioma stem cells which are highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. 4) The immunoinhibitory tumor
microenvironment of GBM renders traditional immunotherapy approaches ineffective.
Due to these challenges GBM treatment has remained largely unchanged for almost 20 years; the current
standard of care is surgical resection followed by radiation and temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. The
addition of TMZ to this therapeutic strategy only extended patient survival for a few months yet it is still in use
today since further developments have yet to show more dramatic survival improvements.
The most promising new treatment for GBM is a specialized form of immunotherapy that utilizes oncolytic
viruses (OVs). When the correct virus is chosen it can overcome the obstacles inhibiting other treatment
approaches. Neurotropic viruses are able to effectively cross the BBB, and the correct virus can specifically
and preferentially target GBM cells while avoiding killing healthy cells. Additionally, 50% of tumors are resistant
to TMZ treatment, but OVs remain effective in these tumors. The data suggests OVs can even overcome and
reverse immunosuppressive microenvironments in the tumors.
We have identified two strains of Zika virus (ZIKV) that demonstrate substantial oncolytic activity and the
potential for safe administration to humans. Our testing shows that these strains preferentially infect GBM cells,
and they effectively and dramatically reduce GBM tumors in a mouse model. We have data suggesting these
strains have a strong safety profile as well. We are incredibly enthusiastic about the therapeutic potential these
strains offer. This proposal is designed specifically to complete IND-enabling experiments in order to move this
novel treatment into the clinic."
10920945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Access to safe drinking water is critical for human health and healthy ecosystems. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) have been found to cause cancer and other health issues and it is becoming known how
widespread they are in the environment. PFAS does not breakdown in the environment and slowly accumulates
over time. This causes the amount of carcinogenic material in the environment to gradually accumulate over time,
which increases health risks. These compounds have been used extensively for decades to manufacture products
such as materials to extinguish fires, add water repellency to fabric, and in non-stick cookware. Two of the most
common are perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). These compounds are
toxic and prevalent in water systems used for human consumption at low concentrations, but testing is performed
infrequently on samples shipped to laboratories for analysis with expensive equipment by trained technicians.
Therefore, there is an unmet need for a rapid, low-cost, point-of-use testing device.
 This project intends to address this unmet need through the development of graphene-based sensor chips
and a portable handheld detector capable of measuring low concentrations of PFAS in water using PFOS and
PFOA as model PFAS compounds. NanoAffix has developed graphene-based sensors on gold interdigitated
electrodes (IDEs) that are capable of rapid detection of other contaminants in water at point-of-use. This disruptive
technology takes advantage of the unique properties of graphene to detect small changes in conductivity caused
by contaminants binding to the graphene-based sensor surface. This small change in conductivity can be
correlated to concentration to provide quantitative results. A probe is immobilized onto the graphene-based sensor
surface to add specificity to the sensors. PFAS have been shown to selectively attach to β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)
due to its unique cage-like structure enabling host-guest interactions, together with electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions between PFAS and β-CD. NanoAffix has the objectives of developing a proof-of-concept technology
to detect PFAS down to 1 ng/L (ppt) within 50% of results obtained by LC-MS-MS, studying the effect of potential
interfering species and minimizing the impact to below 20% of the signal response, and demonstrating sensor
performance with a prototype handheld testing device. The development of this prototype testing device will
provide rapid and onsite results for the detection of these carcinogens in water and enable cost-effective mitigation
strategies to be implemented to improve the quality and safety of drinking water."

Fannin Partners is developing a drug, 11h, for the management of stimulant use disorders (StUD), an area of
major unmet medical need. Our key innovation is selective inhibition of a key inflammatory pathway in the brain
while reducing the adverse events associated with currently available non-selective inhibitors. StUDs have
increased rapidly in the last decade with stimulants now the 2nd most commonly used illicit substance (after
cannabis products), related to 75% of federal drug-related offenses. Methamphetamine (MA) is a stimulant with
high abuse potential and has become one of the most widely available and illicitly-used substances. Despite the
lack of specific therapeutics approved for StUD, inpatient treatment costs are estimated at ~$2.15 billion. Thus,
new treatment options are urgently needed - ideally orally available and with new mechanisms.
11h is orally bioavailable and shows promising efficacy in multiple animal models of substance use disorders,
including with cocaine, as well as anti-inflammatory activity. 11h appeared well tolerated in a variety of toxicology
models. 11h also demonstrated a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in animals with oral bioavailability and strong
brain penetration.
Here, we propose to further develop the drug through early pre-IND efficacy and toxicology studies. Our
experienced management team and key collaborators provide the environments required to successfully achieve
our proposed aims. We truly believe that this novel drug could potentially play a crucial role in saving lives and
reducing the current health crisis."
10910925,"Project Summary/Abstract
Clinical trials are the highest standard of evidence for the effectiveness and safety of medical interventions.
Unfortunately, children often receive medical therapies that have never been studied in clinical trials involving
pediatric subjects. Children often respond differently from adults to medications due to differences in
physiology and drug metabolism, placing children at increased risk of experiencing adverse, even life-
threatening events from off-label use of medical treatments. Additionally, one-fifth of US children suffer from at
least one chronic disease and face the risks of receiving treatments based on scant data. Children from rural
and medically underserved communities bear a disproportionately large risk of not benefiting from medical
treatments as researchers often fail to engage individuals from these communities in research. However, when
asked, children enrolled in clinical trials state that their participation provided them with access to more
treatment options, improved their understanding of their disease, and provided them with the opportunity to
help other people. Since 2016 the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) has engaged
children, families, and health care providers from rural and medically underserved communities in high-quality
pediatric clinical trials. The Nebraska Pediatric Clinical Trials Unit (NPCTU) plays a leading role in defining and
ensuring best practices in clinical trials design, initiation, and conduct within the ISPCTN and serves as a
transformative resource for pediatric research in Nebraska and neighboring IDeA states. The objective of the
current application is to further extend clinical trials participation opportunities and infrastructure to rural and
underserved communities across Nebraska. The NPCTU team will achieve this objective by expanding
institutional and community partnerships regionally and nationally. Specifically, we will increase rural
engagement in clinical trials through partnership with researchers at the University of Nebraska at Kearney and
health care providers, children, and families at the Children’s Physicians Kearney clinic, and through regular
communication with a rural community advisory board. In partnership with the Great Plains IDeA-CTR and
other ISPCTN sites regionally we will train pediatric health care providers and research staff to participate in
ISPCTN-approved clinical trials and provide junior faculty with mentorship and training that enables them to
advance their careers as researchers in child health. Finally, as a core resource within the Child Health
Research Institute, the NPCTU will help increase research infrastructure access and utilization across the
University of Nebraska Medical Center and Children’s Hospital & Medical Center. The NPCTU administrative
team will measure and track key performance indicators of clinical trials engagement, conduct, and capacity-
building using metrics organized according to the RE-AIM framework. Renewing the NPCTU will: 1) enhance
access to innovative medical therapies for Nebraska children; and 2) improve workforce capacity in Nebraska
to conduct clinical trials, which will provide better health care options for pediatric patients."

Our bodies consist of an exquisite collection of tissues and organs that undergo constant change. From
morphogenesis and homeostasis to the progression of disease, these changes are associated with both the
healthy and unhealthy processes that define human life. My research program at the University of Washington
is developing robust and uniquely powerful multidisciplinary methodologies to mimic, exploit, and quantify
these changes, particularly as they evolve in both time and 3D space (i.e., 4D). In our lab’s first five years of
existence, we have: (1) developed a suite of synthetic cell-culture platforms whose biochemical and
biophysical properties can be reversibly modulated in 4D using cytocompatible photochemistries, and have
utilized these platforms to regulate proliferation, migration, differentiation, and intracellular signaling at single-
and sub-cellular resolutions; (2) introduced a photodegradable material-based approach to generate the first
endothelialized 3D vascular networks within cell-laden hydrogel biomaterials that span nearly all size scales of
native human vasculature (including capillaries); (3) reported the first modular framework for imparting
biomaterials with precise degradative responsiveness to multiple environmental cues/biomarkers following
user-programmable Boolean logic; and (4) established the first tools for “spatiotemporally resolved
proteomics”, enabling visualization and quantification of proteins produced in vitro and in vivo within user-
defined regions in 4D. The present proposal expands our group’s capabilities in each of these areas, paving
the way to new therapeutic targets and treatments of disease through a fundamentally transformed knowledge
of basic cell physiology. In this project, we will: (1) exploit our 4D-tunable biomaterials to recapitulate and probe
cardiovascular developmental signaling in vitro, examining the manner in which precise spatial and temporal
presentation of signaling proteins culminates in orchestrated differentiation; (2) employ synthetic capillaries to
examine drug action and resistance, screen therapeutics, and investigate microvascular occlusion, thrombosis,
and altered remodeling that occurs in many hematologic diseases (e.g., sickle cell anemia, spherocytosis); (3)
develop and deploy hydrogel nanoparticles exhibiting logic-based degradative response to cancer-presented
biomarkers to deliver small molecule chemotherapeutics to tumors with unprecedented specificity; and (4)
extend our 4D proteomic strategies to permit optically and physiologically defined proteomic mapping in living
tissue and model organisms. Critically, the methods that we are developing and implementing are cell-, tissue-,
and disease-agnostic, enabling enhanced understanding of a wide variety of biological processes while laying
the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

The U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) plan aims to reduce new HIV infections by 90% by 2030 through
providing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those at risk for HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) for those
with HIV. The EHE does not integrate substance use disorder (SUD) assessments and treatments nor provide
implementation strategies on providing PrEP/ART for persons who use drugs (PWUD) involved in the justice
system, a critically underserved population. In response to RFA-DA-24: Ending the HIV Epidemic: Focus on
Justice Populations with SUD (R61/R33), our proposed study titled STOP (Shared decision making to Treat Or
Prevent) HIV in Justice Populations is a 5-year project; the first year (R61) is dedicated to a single site pilot study
in CT, followed by a 4-year, 4 site (CT, KY, and 2 in TX) type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study (R33).
We build on existing partnerships between our multi-disciplinary research teams, justice and community
agencies, and stakeholders with lived experience, to develop and assess a patient-centered approach to access
PrEP/ART/SUD services. Following a differentiated service delivery model implementation approach, we focus
on incorporating (1) risk assessments conducted by patient navigators (PN) and (2) providing patient choice
(PC) options for services delivery methods (e.g., brick and mortar clinic, telehealth, mobile health unit) to access
PrEP/ART/SUD; this enhanced implementation approach will be compared to routine PN alone and include
implementation and participant outcomes. Aim 1 (R61) is to develop and pilot test the PN+PC menu of options
of PrEP/ART and SUD treatment services for justice-involved PWUD compared to established PN in CT, which
will be achieved by meeting the following milestones: (1) build upon established collaborations to include multiple
service delivery models and the perspectives of persons with lived experience; (2) curate a menu of PC options
to access PrEP/ART and SUD services; (3) conduct a pilot study that includes among N=30 adults with recent
justice system involvement with DSM-5 SUD at risk or living with HIV, randomized 1:1 to PN vs. PN+PC to assess
acceptability, feasibility, and proportion who (a) access a clinician and (b) receive treatment (ART, PrEP, SUD,
harm reduction); (4) seek guidance from the Patient Engagement Resource Center to inform the final
implementation model of the R33; (5) develop a common set of R33 measures; and (6) obtain R33 IRB/OHRP
approval. Aim 2 (R33) will use R61 data to inform our type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study of PN
vs PN+PC in 4 communities (CT, 2 in TX, KY) using the R61 eligibility criteria, with Aim 2. 1 evaluating patient-
level outcomes (proportion accessing clinicians and treatment) and Aim 2.2 assessing system-level
implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, penetration), sustainment, and costs of implementing both
PN and PN+PC approaches. This study has the potential to be paradigm-shifting by assessing how best to
engage a population who struggles to access the traditional health system and determining if a choice in how
they engage HIV/SUD services impacts clinical and system-level outcomes."

an estimated female population of 102 million and HIV prevalence of 1.6% among adult females, Nigeria has the
largest population of women and the 4th largest number of women living with HIV (WLHIV) in Africa. Although
access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among WLHIV in Nigeria has increased over the years, with over 98% of
the 960,000 WLHIV on ART, AIDS-related mortality remains high. In 2020, 16,000 WLHIV died from AIDS-
related illnesses including cervical cancer. A pilot implementation program in Nigeria demonstrated that
leveraging the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supported HIV programs for the
provision of evidence-based cervical cancer screen-and-treat interventions in WLWH is feasible. The pilot
program demonstrated, however, that tailored implementation strategies will be needed to address specific
multilevel barriers along the cancer control continuum in order to address adoption, reach, and sustainability that
are necessary for successful scale-up. However, in many African countries with a high burden of both HIV and
cervical cancer, there is a paucity of evidence-based implementation strategies to inform effective integration of
HIV and cervical cancer services delivery. Objectives of this proposal are to: 1) Refine strategies to integrate
cervical cancer screening, treatment and management within existing comprehensive HIV treatment programs
and determine implementation readiness; 2) Determine the comparative effectiveness of a Core set of
implementation strategies versus Core+ enhanced implementation strategies; and 3) assess sustainment of the
integration of cervical cancer screening, treatment, and management intervention into HIV programs. We have
assembled a strong team from University of California San Diego; University of Nigeria, Nsukka and John
Hopkins University with expertise in implementation science, HIV care and research, and cancer care and
research. Our proposal is responsive to the NCI RFA and consistent with the World Health Organization global
plan of elimination of cervical cancer by 2030. If effective, the proposed project will result in a set of feasible,
culturally adaptable, and sustainable implementation strategies to integrate evidence-based cervical cancer
screening and treatment into HIV programs in order to improve the health and life expectancy of WLHIV."
10911242,"The 21st century has recorded the emergence of three highly pathogenic respiratory coronaviruses, including Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, the ongoing Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2013 and a novel SARS-like coronaviruses SARS-CoV2 (SARS2) in Wuhan, China in Dec 2019. SARS2 causes COVID19, a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and has infected 95000 individuals with ~20% severe cases and a ~3% mortality rate, resulting in over 3700 deaths. In the elderly, mortality rates approach 15%. The overall program goals are to identify the viral and host determinants, which regulate the atomic-level interactions between the SARS2 S-glycoprotein and various ACE2 receptor and associated entry components such as cellular proteases. The impact of these studies are high, as these interactions regulate 2019-nHCoV species specificity and host tropism, which play critical roles in viral pathogenesis and inform the evolutionary pathways leading to virus emergence and spread in humans and perhaps other intermediate hosts. In parallel, we apply these and other findings to developing robust mouse models of SARS2-mediated human disease, which is critical for not only evaluating viral pathogenesis but also for future testing of antiviral drugs, immunotherapeutics and vaccines."
10911244,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proportion of bilingual speakers in the United States is increasing and the majority of the world's
population is bilingual or multilingual, yet most accounts of human cognition are based on monolingualism.
The proposed research uses bilingualism as a means to study general principles underlying human language,
cognition, and the brain, as well as an end in itself to understand how the rapidly growing bilingual segment of
the population processes language and performs on cognitive tasks. The objective of the proposed research is
to examine the relationship between language interaction and higher order cognition in bilinguals and to study
the consequences of language co-activation for memory (Aim 1), decision making (Aim 2), and semantic
organization (Aim 3). The approach relies on interdisciplinary methods that include eye-tracking, EEG,
advanced multilevel statistical modeling, and cognitive and linguistic testing of Spanish-English bilinguals (the
largest bilingual population in the U.S.) and Korean-English bilinguals (to dissociate effects of phonology and
orthography). Our previous research has shown that bilinguals co-activate both languages in parallel during
language comprehension. Studies 1-3 aim to uncover how co-activation of the two languages during visual
search influences later memory for previously-seen target and competitor items. Studies 4-6 focus on the
influence of bilingualism and language co-activation on decision making. Studies 7-9 examine how experience
with two interacting languages changes the organization of the semantic network. Within each Aim, the first
experiment establishes the key phenomenon, the second takes a fine-grained look at the underlying
mechanisms, and the third tests the generalizability of the main effect under more stringent conditions. The
proposed research is innovative in linking language co-activation and higher order cognition in bilinguals and
in looking at how online sensory and linguistic processing of auditory and visual input impacts what bilinguals
subsequently remember, how they make decisions, and how they represent knowledge. The proposed studies
are theoretically significant by providing insight into the relationship between language and higher order
cognition from the unique vantage point of bilingualism and by contributing to understanding how experience
with multiple languages reconfigures cognitive architecture. Addressing broader societal needs, this work has
applied significance for the large segment of the population speaking more than one language, for whom
clinical, educational, and social outcomes can be improved by developing interventions that capitalize on the
interaction between the two languages -- for example, to improve memory in individuals who experience
memory decline (including older adults), to optimize decision making (including in healthcare settings), and to
promote learning and semantic development across the lifespan. Public health depends on accurate accounts of
cognitive and neural function, and the proposed research contributes to the development of such accounts for
linguistically diverse populations."
10911247,"ABSTRACT
Chronic cancer-related pain is highly prevalent and international guidelines have long supported the use of
opioid therapy for moderate to severe pain related to active disease. The strength of such consensus is
strongest for patients experiencing advanced disease and limited life expectancy. For patients experiencing
long-term remission, or, stable or indolent disease without the need for ongoing anti-cancer treatment (“long-
term survivorship”), there is emerging consensus that opioid therapies should be addressed in a similar
manner as for patients with chronic non-cancer pain. There is mounting ambiguity regarding best practices for
patients receiving active anti-cancer treatment intended for cure. In the wake of the opioid epidemic, state
policies have proliferated in an effort to reduce unsafe opioid prescribing. Prominent recent policies include
state mandates for prescriber participation in the Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) and state
legislative limits on duration and/or dosage of opioid prescriptions for acute pain. These policies vary in their
intended applicability to subpopulations of cancer patients, and, coupled with the ambiguity regarding clinical
best practices, may have inadvertently impacted opioid use and related outcomes among the different
subpopulations of people with cancer. We propose a study to evaluate intended and unintended consequences
of the two types of state policies for opioid prescriptions and pain- and opioid-related adverse health events
among cancer patients with advanced disease, long-term survivors, and patients receiving active cancer
treatment. To help elucidate mechanisms underlying changes in response to policies, we will also explore the
trajectories of opioids dispensed and clinical encounters within each subpopulation, using an innovative pattern
mining approach. We will use the SEER-Medicare linked database and a large national commercial insurance
database to achieve study aims. Findings will inform consensus-building, guideline and intervention
development, and policy and practice changes by providers, health care organizations, and policymakers in
optimizing opioid prescribing and pain management for cancer patients."
10911325,"Glioblastomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors. Total neurosurgical resection of
glioblastomas is not possible, and tumors invariably recur even following resection, chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Despite extensive research into the biology of glioblastomas, there has been no change in the
standard of care for ~20 years and the median lifespan from time of diagnosis to death remains dismal at ~15
months. This highlights the need for identifying new targets for therapy of these devastating tumors.
 Glioblastomas are characterized by extensive infiltration of microglia; the main resident innate immune
cells of the brain. Yet, despite their large presence, microglia fail to keep the tumor in check and appear to
promote tumor growth. The exact mechanism(s) of this pro-tumor role of microglia remain incompletely
understood. Using an approach that allows us to selectively identify and isolate microglia present within the
tumor (vs. those in the same brain but outside the tumor), we determined the transcriptomes of these
Glioblastoma Associated Microglia (GAMi) by RNASeq in a murine model of glioblastoma. We found that
glioblastomas reprogram microglial transcriptional networks by downregulating pathways potentially involved in
recognizing and killing tumor cells. Specifically, we found that GAMi have downregulated: (a) genes potentially
involved in immune sensing and phagocytosis of glioblastoma cells and (b) transcripts potentially involved in
direct tumor killing. We also found that most of the changes observed in GAMi may be driven by a microglia
specific pathway. We obtained similar findings when we analyzed datasets from human glioblastoma patients.
 In this application, we propose to test which of these microglial transcriptional changes are functionally
important in regulating tumor growth using three preclinical mouse glioblastoma models and a co-culture model
of patient-derived human glioblastoma and iPSC-derived microglia. We will also identify the precise microglial
pathway(s) that regulates these processes. To achieve this, we propose three specific aims. In aim 1, we will
determine if GAMi have reduced functional capacity to recognize and phagocytose tumor cells, and the effect of
such reduced capacity on tumor growth. In aim 2, we will determine if GAMi have reduced functional capacity to
kill tumor cells, and the effect of such reduced capacity on tumor growth. In aim 3, we determine the specific
microglial pathway that regulates microglial sensing and phagocytosis of glioblastoma cells, direct killing of tumor
cells and whether targeting such pathway will regulate overall tumor growth. Our studies would provide proof of
concept that these pathways can be used as potential effective targets for therapy of this devastating tumor."
10911913,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Speech disorders are the most prevalent form of communication disorders. Many treatments of speech
disorders involve learning new speech behaviors or modifying abnormal speech behaviors. These treatments
strongly rely on processes of speech motor learning—improvement in motor performance through practice.
However, speech disorders are often associated with impairments in various speech motor learning processes,
resulting in inefficient or deficient speech motor learning. Inefficiencies in speech motor learning processes
reduce the effectiveness of the treatments that rely on these learning processes. Therefore, there is a critical
need (1) to understand the specific contributions of each of the processes of speech motor learning and (2) to
develop behavioral protocols that selectively influence various motor learning processes to improve speech
motor performance. Without this knowledge, the promise of developing effective and optimized treatments for
speech disorders will likely remain limited. This proposal’s overall objective is to develop behavioral protocols
that selectively target and improve speech motor learning processes in healthy adults. Here, we propose a
research program to develop and optimize a set of visually augmented training protocols to improve the accuracy
of two processes crucial for successful speech motor learning: auditory error detection and auditory-to-motor
mapping. Our central hypothesis is that improving these processes through augmented training can improve
speech motor learning. We formulated this hypothesis based on current theoretical models of speech, including
our recent computational model. Aim 1 will evaluate the effects of error-detection training on speech motor
learning. Using visual feedback and auditory feedback perturbation, we will train subjects to detect and estimate
auditory errors more accurately. Subsequently, we will evaluate subjects’ extent of speech motor learning. Aim
2 will determine the contributions of auditory-to-motor mapping to speech motor learning. Using visual feedback,
we will train subjects to learn the relationship between various articulatory configurations and their auditory
consequences. Then, we will evaluate subjects’ extent of speech motor learning. This project’s results will have
a critical positive impact because (1) they will form a strong scientific foundation that can inform the development
of effective and optimized treatments for speech disorders, and (2) they will have significant theoretical
implications by elucidating processes of speech motor learning."
10911915,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this research is to utilize a plasma-based genomic biomarker of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
to guide therapy in metastatic breast and other cancers. In our approach, we use a cfDNA ‘ultra low pass
whole genome sequencing’ (ULP-WGS) assay with computational pipeline (ichorCNA) to determine the
amount of tumor DNA in circulation (‘tumor fraction’; TFx). Changes in TFx may serve as an early identifier for
patients responding – or failing to respond – to therapy and cfDNA ULP-WGS provides a cost-effective,
minimally-invasive approach to determine TFx. Our ULP-WGS cfDNA assay allows rapid, precise quantitation
of TFx from a single blood sample without prior knowledge of tumor mutations. While most liquid biopsy
approaches to date have focused on tracking known alterations or commonly mutated genes in cancer, our
approach is mutation agnostic and broadly applicable across advanced cancers.
This proposal developed through deep collaboration between three primary investigators working on concert
on the development and application of a cell-free DNA assay to guide prognosis and therapy in advanced
cancers. To date, we have performed the research version of this assay on over 3000 patients samples and, in
three publications to date, we demonstrate clinical utility in metastatic breast and prostate cancer as well as
multiple myeloma. We bring expertise in clinical breast cancer, sequencing assay development, and CLIA
sequencing at scale, with a strong track record of collaboration with multiple shared publications. All three PIs
are dedicated to the success of this proposal, with distinct yet complementary roles and responsibilities.
In this proposal, we will analytically validate our cfDNA ULP-WGS assay (UH2 portion) then establish clinical
validity and prospectively evaluate performance in therapeutic clinical trials (UH3 portion). In the UH2 portion,
we will determine the sensitivity and specificity of ULP-WGS using serial dilutions of patient samples, then
assess reproducibility, repeatability, and reportable range. We will then determine performance in the context
of ‘real world’ pre-analytic variability including blood collection tube type, amount of plasma, and detection
thresholds with respect to DNA input quantity. In the UH3 portion, we will establish clinical validity by
evaluating TFx in 700 clinical plasma specimens from patients with metastatic breast cancer then advance our
understanding of cfDNA by evaluating the association of TFx with patient response to therapy and survival
outcomes. Finally, we will evaluate ULP-WGS in two prospective therapeutic clinical trials of metastatic triple-
negative breast cancer, evaluating association with response to therapy."

This project was developed in partnership with and supported by IHC leaders and the Tribal 
Council. It will actively use a community-engaged research approach, which helps ensure IHC- 
centric leadership and direction. As such, there is high probability that study findings will be 
relevant to IHC clinical and public health practice, allowing for rapid effective dissemination, and 
sustainability. This research is significant in that it addresses the extremely low cervical cancer 
screening rates among AI/AN women and the low HPV vaccination rates in adolescents. The 
proposed multi-level intervention in low-resource health care settings in Southern California has 
potential to provide scalable and sustainable solutions for cervical cancer prevention and HPV- 
related malignancies that could be adopted.

10903155,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This project will assess a deep learning approach for predicting the effects of genetic variants on chromatin
accessibility (CA). Currently, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the function and causality of genetic
variants in human genetics research since over 90% of genetic variants have been found within the non-coding
region of the genome. GWAS studies have provided us with information about these genetic variant
associations. However, this research has yet to establish the molecular function of these genetic variants.
Molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis has been used to determine variant function, and the
identification of variants associated with molecular traits such as caQTLs. However, due to linkage
disequilibrium, the identification of causal variants found from molecular QTL analysis is ambiguous; thus, they
lack the power to identify associations with rare genetic variants. Furthermore, it has been shown that
allelic-specific information, including allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA), can increase the power to
detect caQTLs, potentially improving machine learning model predictions. An alternative approach to
determining variant function are machine learning methods, which have been utilized to determine the
molecular function of genetic variants and have achieved success at predicting gene expression, CA, and
transcription factor binding from DNA sequence. However, these machine learning models are solely trained
on reference genome sequences and do not consider human genetic variation. The key focus of this research
proposal is to investigate the hypothesis that a machine learning model that utilizes genetic variation and
allele-specific information will accurately predict the effects of both common and rare genetic variants on
chromatin accessibility. To investigate this hypothesis, here are two specific aims: Aim 1 will develop a
variant-aware neural network to predict the effect of genetic variants on CA. Aim 2 will predict the function of
rare genetic variants. In summary, this proposal strives to establish improved predictions of the molecular
function of genetic variants found in the non-coding region of the genome by assessing the utility of genetic
variation and ASCA with a deep learning approach. The proposed study will lead to the ability to predict the
function of rare genetic variants, which are likely to be highly important to disease traits, but whose function
cannot currently be uncovered utilizing QTL-based methods. This training plan will provide the applicant the
opportunity to (1) develop expertise in machine learning in genomics, (2) gain skills in CRISPR-based genome
editing, (3) improve scientific writing and communication skills, and (4) develop mentoring and teaching
aptitude. These professional training goals will provide the applicant with the essential training and scientific
experience required to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship and thereafter become an impactful independent
research investigator at an R1 University."

There is a substantial and growing need for in vivo toxicity testing, as in drug R&D it is critical to be able to
understand toxicity and to identify and eliminate overly toxic candidates. We developed an imaging-based
approach that detects toxicity-induced tissue injury in a minimally invasive, whole body and dynamic fashion.
The goal of the current Phase II STTR grant is to expand the marketability and market readiness of the
technology by demonstrating a broadened scope of utilities including semi-quantitative characterization and drug
safety. Overall, this in vivo imaging approach identifies an important marker for drug toxicity on a personalized
basis with objective and quantitative metric. The early detection of drug toxicity in susceptible tissues will help
make timely decisions in drug R&D by prioritizing safe and efficacious candidates. The technology is applicable
to multiple stages in pharmaceutical R&D and is expected to generate a significant impact on drug development
and drug safety."

Stimulation (TMS) to Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (BCBT) to reduce Veterans' rates of suicide ideation
and related behaviors. Over 20 Veterans die each day of suicide and rates have not appreciably decreased in
the last ten years. [BCBT is a well-established and efficacious treatment that is an extension of Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy, a treatment that is widely implemented across VA health care systems]. However, not all
patients respond to BCBT. Thus finding ways to enhance treatment efficacy for reducing suicide is critical.
TMS may be an optimal treatment to use in conjunction with psychotherapy. TMS is a noninvasive technique
that uses a pulsed magnetic field to induce neuronal depolarization in a targeted brain region, typically the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. TMS can reduce psychiatric symptoms associated with suicide risk in Veterans,
including depression and PTSD. Furthermore, TMS is not associated with the systemic and costly side effects
associated with medications used for these disorders (e.g., weight gain, diabetes, sexual side effects).
 The Aim of this study is to conduct a fully powered randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of
adding a standard TMS course of treatment to BCBT to reduce suicide behaviors in a sample of Veterans
hospitalized for suicide behavior. One hundred and thirty (130) Veterans admitted to the psychiatric unit for
suicide ideation or attempts will be randomized to active TMS plus BCBT or to sham TMS plus BCBT.
Participants will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment, six, and 12 months post hospital discharge. Efficacy
of the program will be determined by examining a primary suicide composite outcome and several secondary
outcomes including [suicide attempt, time to first attempt, number of re-hospitalizations and severity and
severity of suicidal ideation]. Secondary analyses will be conducted to help identify the types of patients who
will receive the most benefit from the addition of TMS to BCBT Brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for suicide.
If successful, this study would result in a combined treatment to decrease suicide ideation and related
behaviors. The proposal addresses HSRD post-deployment health priority, specifically suicide prevention and
is innovative in that it will be the first study to examine efficacy of combined treatment specifically for suicide
prevention.
 [If successful, next steps include dissemination and implementation throughout the VA in coordination
with our local VISN and VA operations. Results will be used to work with partners to implement the intervention
in multiple VAMC centers and target SAIL metrics such as re-admission rates and patient mortality.
Consultation with VISN, VACO, and the suicide prevention MIRECC will be utilized to implement the treatment
program across the VA. A partnered QUERI application will be submitted if results demonstrate promise.]"

In order to advance the understanding of life processes at the molecular level, we developed multiscale computer
simulations that can treat complex biological systems. We intend to apply such strategies to systems which are
to important medical problems. Our proposed projects are listed below.
A.1 Enzymatic Processes: By exploiting our advances in multiscale modeling, we intend to progress in the
following directions: (a) Quantifying computer-aided enzyme design by: (i) reproducing the observed trend in
experiments of directed evolution using automatic configuration generator coupled with EVB simulations; (ii)
reproducing the catalytic activity of experimentally designed enzymes; (iii) improving the action of promiscuous
enzymes; (iv) destroying and rebuilding active sites. Our studies will be done in collaboration with key
experimental groups. (b) Continuing to advance the quantitative computational methods, including: (i) using our
PD QM(ai)/MM method in for evaluating the ab initio free energy surfaces of enzymatic reactions; (ii) Advancing
a maximum entropy approach for fast screening (iii) Quantifying the relationship between folding and catalysis;
(c) Conducting studies on important classes of enzymes; (d) Exploring the relations of our findings to medical
problems such as the Covid-19 pandemic, drug resistance and other topics like CRISPR.
A.2 Multiscale Modeling of the energetics and functions of complex biological systems: Basic functions
of living cells are underpinned by proteins that guide the transport of electrons, protons, and ions. Thus, it is
crucial to quantitatively explore and exploit the structure-function correlations using computer simulation
approaches. We have made a major progress in developing microscopic and coarse grained (CG) approaches
for such systems, and we will advance them in the following directions: (a) Simulating the proton transfer (PTR)
gating mechanism of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and extending our recent studies of FO-ATPase. (b) Exploiting
our advances in modeling voltage-gated ion channels for the following purposes: (i) to quantify the interplay
between the electrode potential and the protein/membrane energy landscape, (ii) to reproduce the gating voltage
and the subsequent ion current and its selectivity using both CG and explicit MC electrolyte models, (iii) to
simulating the action of GPCRs and transporters by CG approach, (iv) to explore the relations between our
finding and various diseases."

The Integrated Environmental Science and Health Risk Laboratory, in collaboration with multiple
Arizona partners, propose to launch the project, “Building a culture of health in the green:
Participatory learning and action to address air and soil quality in rural underserved
communities”. Our overall goal is to create a national deep engagement learning model of
Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) education that empowers students
as environmental health advisory board members, photographers, scientists, and designers living
in environmental justice (EJ) communities. EJ communities refers to areas affected by
disproportionate exposure to environmental hazards and increased vulnerability to those hazards.
There are fundamental and critical challenges that exist in environmental justice communities.
Youth growing up in these spaces need the preparation to navigate through these challenges and
be the future pillars of structural change. Students will acquire the tools, skills and support needed
to (1) interpret intersectionality and environmental data and (2) communicate project results and
recommend actions at local, regional, and national levels. The proposed project centers on the
social and environmental factors that affect health and justice for 8th - 12th graders in rural Arizona
communities with significant environmental health hazards posed from historical or active
resource extraction activities. Intersectionality and environmental health and data literacy are
essential for deriving meaning from the results of scientific inquiry. Potential outcomes for the
proposed project are increased understanding and integration of intersectionality, environmental
health (specifically air and soil quality), and data literacy among both youth and researchers,
and the application such information to achieve social justice and health equity in EJ communities.
This research education program aims to leverage intersectionality’s transformational power and
help move the collaborating EJ communities closer to achieving social justice and health equity.
Through the approach and rigorous learning research, the outcomes of this work will provide the
evidence-base needed for building a culture of health in the green."
10928087,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an immune complex-mediated disease in which clinical disease
manifests after an innate immune response. Endothelial cells (EC) are conditional effector cells activated by
inflammatory stimuli to produce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and signal for influx of inflammatory
cells into tissue. We have published that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) modulates inflammation in
lupus nephritis (LN) and that uncoupling of EC eNOS (which reduces production of anti-inflammatory nitric oxide
(NO) and increases production of pro-inflammatory ROS) is a potential therapeutic target in SLE. We hypothesize
that sepiapterin, a compound that couples eNOS, will improve LN outcomes and vascular function in murine LN
and work by modulating the PI3Kinase/Akt pathway to reduce expression of inflammation and fibrosis genes in
mice and in cultured glomerular endothelial cells. We further hypothesize that the proposed approach may have
off target effects, particularly in T cells, monocyte/macrophages, and podocytes. To address this overarching
hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1) Determine the effect of sepiapterin in
murine LN on clinical and histologic LN outcomes, large vessel endothelial function, and
pharmacodynamic markers of treatment response. We hypothesize that sepiapterin will improve LN
outcomes and vascular function in murine LN. To determine the effect of and optimal therapeutic indication for
ECD targeted therapy, we will use the NZM2410 model of spontaneous LN and compare groups with and without
sepiapterin treatment to determine effect on three different endpoints. 1) preventing/prolonging LN onset with
sepiapterin monotherapy, 2) in mycophenolate-treated mice, improving/hastening induction of remission with
sepiapterin as an adjunctive therapy, and 3) after inducing remission, prolonging/preventing LN flare with
sepiapterin monotherapy after mycophenolate withdrawal. LN clinical and histologic parameters and large vessel
endothelial function will be the primary endpoints. Biomarkers of systemic oxidative stress will serve as
exploratory pharmacodynamic indicators. Specific Aim 2. Determine differential gene expression and
phosphokinase signaling events, with a focus on the PI3K/Akt pathway, induced in human glomerular
endothelial cells (HRGECs) by LN serum and modulated by sepiapterin. Based on our published and
preliminary studies, we hypothesize that inflammatory gene expression and PDGF receptor/PI3K/Akt/FoxO1
signaling induced by LN flare serum can be modulated by sepiapterin in HRGECs. Knowledge of pathways
activated by LN flare serum that both initiate redox-regulated pathways and that can be modulated by restoring
coupling to eNOS will be important for rational development of therapies to target ECD in LN. We will culture
HRGECs with serum from SLE patients with active nephritis or a cytokine mix and perturb signaling through the
PDGFR, PI3K, and Akt to determine the effect on gene expression and NO and superoxide production. Specific
Aim 3. Determine differential inflammatory and fibrosis gene expression and pathway enrichment in
endothelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells, and podocytes from renal glomerular tissue and in T
cells from the spleen in mice treated with increasing doses of sepiapterin. Based on our published and
preliminary studies, we hypothesize that candidate PI3K-Akt signaling gene enrichment (both potentiated by and
inducing of oxidative stress in a feed forward fashion) will be modulated by sepiapterin. NZM2410 mice will be
treated with increasing doses of sepiapterin and renal cortical and spleen tissue analyzed by single cell RNA
sequencing. The ultimate goal of our translational group is to target ECD to improve cardiovascular and renal
outcomes in LN. Given the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in LN, we will study endothelium-dependent
vascular function to inform early human studies of cardiovascular prevention. The aims proposed here will
demonstrate the most effective treatment indications, pharmacodynamic markers of response, and alternate or
adjunctive targets to reduce inflammatory ECD in LN and other diseases of endothelial dysfunction in Veterans."
10928088,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most common form of hemorrhagic stroke, accounts for up to 15% of all
strokes. ICH, which affects 67,000 Americans annually, induces the highest acute mortality and the worst long-
term neurological outcomes of all types of stroke. Primary ICH is caused by the rupture of small vessels damaged
by chronic hypertension or cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The resultant hematoma disrupts neural networks and
damages the vascular architecture, culminating in a loss of brain function and the need for lifelong medical
assistance. Re-establishment of a functional cerebrovascular network of small arteries and arterioles is a
prerequisite for the removal of damaged tissue and for restoration of cerebral blood flow to deliver nutrients,
trophic factors, and stem cells within the injured brain. Thus, there is a dire need for neurorestorative therapies
that provide cerebrovascular recovery after ICH. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC), the repetitive delivery of
sub-lethal ischemia to a remote limb, demonstrated safety, versatility, and efficacy in early stage clinical trials;
however, the utility of RIC after ICH remains understudied. The objective of this proposal is to test the
overarching hypothesis that RIC induces vascular remodeling and improves long-term neurological function
via anti-inflammatory myeloid cell activation after ICH. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that myeloid
AMPKα1 mediates RIC-induced vascular repair after ICH. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that RIC
increases angiogenesis via Del-1 release after ICH. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that delayed
implementation of RIC improves chronic ICH outcomes in a sex- and age-independent manner. Expected
outcomes of the proposed research include the identification of RIC as a clinically-safe, non-invasive
intervention to promote cerebrovascular recovery after ICH. As ICH patients exhibit high permanent disability
rates that diminish quality of life, our proposed research will identify a simple therapy to harness an endogenous
pathway of neurological repair, providing an innovative and cost-effective approach to rehabilitate chronic ICH
patients.

Polyamines are small molecules abundant in eukaryotic cells that function in transcription and translation.
While these molecules are important for cellular function, emerging evidence suggests that polyamine
metabolism is intricately linked to diverse metabolic pathways within the cell. The interconnectedness of
metabolic pathways has significant consequences for cells, as well as pathogens. We previously demonstrated
that polyamines support replication of diverse RNA viruses and that upon detection of infection, cells induce
polyamine depletion. Polyamine depletion limits infection by bunyaviruses (Rift Valley fever virus [RVFV] and
La Crosse virus [LACV]), flaviviruses (Zika virus [ZIKV] and dengue viruses), and enteroviruses
(Coxsackievirus B3 [CVB3], rhinovirus), among several others. We hypothesize that these distinct virus
families subvert cellular metabolism, specifically through polyamines, to support virus replication.
Here, we will investigate (1) how viruses utilize polyamines at distinct stages of replication, (2) how viruses
confront polyamine depletion, and (3) how polyamine biosynthesis connects to other metabolic pathways to
support virus replication.
We use the RVFV, ZIKV, and CVB3 model systems in our work because these viruses represent three
evolutionarily distant viruses with different replicative and structural differences. While each of these viruses
relies on polyamines for replication, we find that how they use polyamines is different. Now, we will expand on
this work to understand the roles of distinct polyamines during virus infection, including roles in virion structure,
cellular attachment, and genome replication. We will also use these model systems to understand how these
viruses manipulate polyamine metabolism. Finally, we will investigate how the differences in polyamine
utilization may reflect how polyamines affect other cellular metabolic pathways, including lipid and cholesterol
synthesis. This work will illuminate the connectedness of polyamine biosynthesis to other metabolic pathways
and how viruses rely on these interconnected pathways for successful replication. This work will highlight
fundamental roles for polyamines in virus replication and in cellular metabolism."

Retrotransposons are ancient components of our genetic code that have self-replicated over millions of years
and now make up 45% of our genome. Retrotransposon activation has serious implications for cell viability –
retrotransposition is mutagenic by its nature and even expression of “dead” retrotransposons can trigger innate
immune responses that cause inflammation. Therefore, the cell has evolved intricate epigenetic mechanisms
to silence expression of retrotransposons by sequestering them in constitutive heterochromatin, which is
marked the epigenetic modifications of H3K9 methylation and DNA CpG methylation. Dysregulation of H3K9
methylation and CpG methylation causes widespread re-activation of retrotransposons and occurs in multiple
human diseases. However, very little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms that initiate
retrotransposon silencing or maintain retrotransposons in a silent state. The broad goal of this research
program is to define the precise molecular mechanisms the cell uses to suppress retrotransposon
expression. A key component of the cells retrotransposon silencing machinery is the histone lysine
methyltransferase Setdb-1, which deposits H3K9 methyl marks at retrotransposons. Because of its central role,
Setdb-1 activity is tightly regulated by a complex cast of molecular players that control its catalytic activation,
recruitment to retrotransposon sequences and its ability to spread histone methylation across the length of
retrotransposons. Appropriate control of Setdb-1 activity is critical for retrotransposon silencing, but many
aspects of Setdb-1 regulation remain enigmatic. We will use in vitro biochemical reconstitutions, Cryo-EM
and genomics to decipher the precise mechanisms that underly regulation of Setbd-1. The work outlined
in this proposal will explain how Setdb-1 is catalytically activated for retrotransposon silencing, how Setdb-1
reads the epigenetic code on retrotransposons and how Setdb-1 is recruited to retrotransposon sequences to
establish H3K9 methylation patterns."

(aka, the BEST End-Stage Cancer Study)
Project Summary
Despite great strides that have been made in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the number
of cancer deaths remains on the rise and cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of death in the United
States (US). Not only is the number of people dying of cancer increasing, but the quality of those
deaths is alarmingly poor. End-of-life (EoL) care in the US has been deemed a public health crisis by
the National Academy of Medicine -- a conclusion bolstered by disturbing findings from my group. My
research has shown that end-stage cancer patients receive chemotherapy troublingly close to death,
that end-stage cancer patients are shockingly uninformed of their prognosis and the harms of EoL
treatments, that racial/ethnic minority groups receive dramatically inferior EoL cancer care, and that
severe emotional pain and suffering remain largely unchecked. The current Outstanding Investigator
Award (OIA) research has identified and targeted psychosocial factors to address these problems;
the results have proved paradigm-shifting and practice-changing. For example, we showed that: 1)
“palliative chemotherapy” does not “palliate” and may actually do more harm than good -> highlighting
the need for oncologists to recognize the harms of “overtreatment” and refrain from prescribing
chemotherapy to patients they deem close to death; 2) oncologist prognostic communication can
improve patient prognostic understanding and lead to more informed, value-concordant EoL care, but
it occurs infrequently, and ineffectively –> our Oncolo-GIST approach as a simple, effective way
oncologists can feel comfortable communicating the gist of a patient’s prognosis; 3) that “one size
does not fit all” in addressing disparities in EoL cancer care->our Divine Intervention targeting black
patients’ medical mistrust and spiritual care needs as a way to promote advance care planning
(ACP); 4) that psychosocial distress is an important influence on, as much as outcome of, EoL
decision-making->our EMPOWER psychosocial intervention targeting “experiential avoidance” to
promote caregiver psychosocial adjustment and engagement in ACP. Going forward, this OIA will
focus on: 1) oncologist communication; 2) cancer disparities; and 3) psychosocial distress. I will
leverage data, theories,and the clinical and scholarly resources (colleagues and collaborators)
developed under the auspices of the current OIA to: improve oncologist delivery of high quality EoL
cancer care; increase the frequency and effectiveness of their prognostic disclosures; promote cancer
patients’ prognostic understanding; ensure the equitable delivery of EoL cancer care; and reduce
psychosocial distress of patients and caregivers to enhance their mental health and promote their
engagement in ACP. Renewal of this OIA will enable me to conduct research helping to ensure that
dying cancer patients and their caregivers receive the highest quality of EoL cancer care possible."
10928109,"The specialization of somatic cell types for unique functions is arguably the most important driver of physiological
complexity in animals. Key innovations in subcellular structure, including the development of a specialized
secretory vesicle, increased the evolvability of cells and provided new opportunities for cellular innovation during
the diversification of animals. For example, the emergence of cells with the capacity to secrete gel-forming mucus
enabled segregation of internal and external tissue compartments facilitating the evolution of organ systems.
Despite the value of novel cell function as a source for the evolution of animal complexity, the genomic
mechanisms promoting the origin and diversification of new cell types remain poorly understood. Recent
advances in sequencing technologies have provided a window into the genomic and transcriptomic environments
of numerous cell types from diverse organisms. While these studies have hypothesized roles for both newly
evolved genes and newly constructed regulatory relationships as critical elements of cell identity, understanding
how new genes get wired into gene regulatory networks (GRNs) to drive the origin of new cell types
remains a key gap in our knowledge of animal development. One challenge limiting progress in this area is
that it is still not feasible to manipulate gene expression in many animal models, hampering our ability to translate
observations of gene expression into functional relationships. A powerful system for modeling GRN evolution
must have a novel trait with a measurable phenotype, an identified network of genes controlling the trait, and a
genetically tractable organism for experimental testing. The novel and diverse seminal fluid proteins of
Drosophila fit all these characteristics and studies in this system have revealed how novel effector genes can
rapidly acquire essential functions affecting both physiology and behavior. Cnidocytes – the explosive, venom-
rich piercing cells that give jellyfish their sting – offer many of the same benefits as Drosophila for
modeling GRN evolution. Unique in both form and function, cnidocytes comprise a diverse lineage of cell types
found only in cnidarians (corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish). Many of the regulatory genes necessary for
cnidocyte development are already known to be novel and unique to this cell type, providing an unparalleled
opportunity to study how new transcription factors become indispensable for the origin of new cell types. The
proposed research will achieve three goals; it will: (1) construct the network of genes controlling the unique
morphologies of the four types of cnidocyte in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, (2) reveal the step-wise
assembly of a unique GRN subcircuit through comparisons of closely related cnidarians, and (3) develop a
technique for redirecting cells to acquire novel secretory functions. By constructing the GRN that promotes
morphogenesis in diverse cnidocyte types, we can pinpoint the genes necessary to drive autonomous
development of the piercing apparatus in new cell types. Thus, this research provides a framework for
adapting cnidocytes for other novel functions that could contribute to new delivery mechanisms for topical drugs."

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa has led to significant improvement in clinical
outcomes in patients with infantile Pompe disease (IPD) with the oldest IPD survivors now reaching teenage
years. A new natural history of Pompe disease (PD) is unfolding. Recognition of factors that negatively impact
response to ERT include cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM)-negative status (no endogenous acid
α-glucosidase (GAA) on Western Blot), immune responses against ERT, and delayed start of ERT. ERT does
not cross the blood-brain barrier, and the impact of glycogen deposition in the nervous system is unknown.
Immune tolerance induction (ITI) has helped prevent immune responses and newborn screening (NBS) for
Pompe disease has led to the early diagnosis, both significant advances in the field. In this multi-center study,
there are three specific aims: 1) Assess the safety and efficacy of ERT in IPD patients with and without ITI; 2)
Describe the early phenotype of patients with Pompe disease diagnosed via NBS and their treatment response
to ERT with and without ITI; and 3) Understand cognitive and neurological involvement in long-term IPD
survivors. For aim 1, via our multi-center collaboration systematic data on IPD patients – who receive ERT and
ITI will be compared to patients who receive ERT alone by the following measures – IgG antibody response,
left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and overall survival. Safety to the ITI will be evaluated by markers of
immune tolerance including CD19 counts, vaccination status and antibody response to vaccines, infections
around the time of ITI, ANC, AST, and ALT levels. For aim 2, patients diagnosed via NBS will undergo
extensive clinical and laboratory evaluations including a clinic visit, physical therapy evaluations, biochemical
tests to detect muscle damage, muscle ultrasounds, speech and swallow evaluation, heart assessments,
hearing assessments, and sleep questionnaires. These measures will be compared with Pompe patients who
were diagnosed clinically (and not via NBS) to identify early features of the disease and to establish benefits of
early initiation of ERT. For aim 3, patients will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, assessments to evaluate
the peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, and cognitive assessments to test for cognitive function,
behavior/executive function, academic skills/education, language, motor function including physical therapy
evaluation, audiology evaluation and, speech evaluation. This multi-center study will expand on the early data
on the role of ITI in establishing immune tolerance, it will result in the capture of data on patients diagnosed via
NBS for the development of evidence-based guidelines and the ability to treat patients with IPD in a timely
manner. It will allow us to truly understand the impact of glycogen accumulation in the brain and the PNS,
currently an unknown."

10931591,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients and health care professionals are now able to use genetic information to help prevent, diagnose and
select treatments for diseases. Health policies can improve or reduce access to genomic tests. Implementation
of policies for genomic tests is growing rapidly but we know little about the effects of such policies. There are
currently no surveillance structures in place to examine outcomes associated with policies for genomic tests.
Randomized trials are generally not feasible to examine the effects of policies. Monitoring the outcomes of
policies is an important public health issue. I propose to advance the field of genomic medicine research
and practice by developing and validating analytical methods for efficient, rigorous evaluation of
policies that could impact access to genomic tests and associated outcomes.
My vision is to pioneer a new approach for efficient, rigorous evaluation of outcomes of genomic medicine
policies. I will lead a team to build the foundation by adapting and validating rigorous analytical methods in a
distributed data network environment that enables efficient but privacy-preserving multi-site analyses of data
from large, diverse populations. We will lay the groundwork through two innovative outputs: (1) Adapt one of
the strongest quasi-experimental study designs, the interrupted time series method, for novel applications:
evaluation of policies for genomic tests. We will adapt the method within a renowned distributed data network
of 17 health systems. No single system has sufficient data for genomic medicine. This approach allows
efficient aggregation of data across sites from large, diverse populations without sharing person-level
information (patient privacy-preserving); and (2) Showcase and refine our analytical methods by using a test
case: we will evaluate the consequences of Medicare’s coverage of next-generation sequencing for patients
with recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or advanced stage III or IV cancer. Our approach will have
broad applicability for other policies for genomic tests and/or related services. The United States, as the
world’s leader in precision medicine, has a vital stake in analytical tools for assessing rigorously and efficiently
the effects of policies for genomic tests—a much-needed resource for patients, clinicians, policymakers who
seek to maximize individual and population health through the integration of genomic medicine into healthcare
policy and practice."
10931633,"Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of human death and disability. In addition to neuroprotective
strategies that have failed previous clinical trials, regenerative therapies have gain escalating attention for brain
repair and functional recovery after stroke. Recently, a breakthrough discovery demonstrates that transduction
of non-neuronal cells such as reactive astrocytes with the panneuronal transcription factor NeuroD1 (ND1) and
a few others can reprogram these cells directly into neural progenitors or even mature and functional neurons
via a process called direct reprogramming/conversion that bypasses stem cell stage. Lentiviral vector delivery
of ND1 to reactive astrocytes results in permanently reprogrammed functional neurons without the need for
maintained ectopic expression of the gene. Thus, intra-lineage direct reprogramming implicates an
unprecedented resource of endogenous neurogenesis by leveraging existing proliferative astrocytes. The
proposal is a novel application of the direct reprogramming after ischemic stroke and explores its application in
aged mice. This approach takes the advantages of injury-induced astrocyte activation and accumulation in the
peri-infarct region. Reprogrammed new neurons, termed induced neurons (iNeurons or iNs), at the injury site
are autologous and post-mitotic, which eliminate the risk of rejection and tumorigenesis of transplanted
exogenous cells. In our preliminary experiments, we successfully converted astrocytes into mature neurons in
vitro and in focal ischemic stroke models of the mouse. Many converted iNs were identified in the brain even
one months after stroke and the conversion. Based on our in vitro and in vivo data and emerging evidence
from other groups, we propose to test this regenerative therapy in a focal ischemic stroke model of aged
mouse. Specific Aim 1 will study the in vitro and in vivo reprogramming of astrocytes into iNs under
hypoxic/ischemic conditions. Using ND1 lentivirus packaged with the GFAP promoter and mCherry marker, we
will validate the efficacy, efficiency and time windows of reprogramming reactive astrocytes as an endogenous
neuronal supply for brain repair. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that direct reprogramming at the right
time can reduce the physical and chemical barriers for neurogenesis. The mechanism of the benefits and a
balanced microenvironment that is neuroprotective as well as permissive for regeneration will be tested.
Specific 3 will study the direct conversion combined with a rehabilitative strategy of increased peripheral
activities in aged mice, designed to overcome impaired neuroregeneration and neural plasticity in the aged
brain. We hypothesize that the combinatorial approach promotes activity-dependent neural plasticity, circuitry
repair, and functional recovery after stroke. These three Aims target coordinated but distinct regenerative
mechanisms, endorsed by compelling evidence and state-of-the-art technologies. We predict that each Aim
alone and/or together will provide novel strategies for a regenerative therapy."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease (without curative therapies) that is critically influenced
by dysregulated inflammatory pathways. This A1 R42 Fast Track STTR application focuses on eNAMPT (extra-
cellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase) as a novel, highly attractive PAH target. Aqualung Therapeutics
has developed a humanized eNAMPT-neutralizing mAb, ALT-100, to address the unmet need for therapies that
improve right ventricular (RV) dysfunction/failure and PAH survival. Circulating eNAMPT is a damage-associ-
ated molecular pattern protein (DAMP) that robustly activates innate immunity-driven inflammatory pathways
via ligation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our published/unpublished data strongly support involvement of
eNAMPT in the pathobiology of human PH. First, we have reported that NAMPT RNA and protein expression
and secretion are significantly increased in PBMCs and in remodeled lung vessels from PAH patients with these
processes highly upregulated by PAH-relevant stimuli, including growth factors and hypoxia via HIF-2α signaling.
Second, plasma eNAMPT levels are elevated and correlate with RV dysfunction in PAH subjects. Thirdly,
NAMPT polymorphisms (SNPs), previously linked to inflammatory severity including ARDS mortality, are asso-
ciated with PAH severity, including cardiac catherization indices of RV dysfunction in a large PAH GWAS. Lastly,
we have compellingly demonstrated that eNAMPT is a highly druggable target, with the eNAMPT-neutralizing
mAb, ALT-100, profoundly attenuating and reversing preclinical PAH vascular remodeling and indices of RV
heart failure. Supporting the feasibility of ALT-100 as a PAH therapy, we have completed non-IND-enabling
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies demonstrating that IV-delivered ALT-100 mAb exhibits a T1/2 half-life of 12-14 days
and 28-day toxicity studies in rats demonstrated that up to 50 mg/kg of ALT-100 is without discernable toxicity.
We have completed stable cell line development, generated both Research and Master Cell Banks, and have
completed a 200L GMP Bioreactor run (expression 6 gms/L); a titer assuring very low Cost of Goods and market
entry at a low price point. ALT-100’s acute IND-enabling studies for the indication of ARDS will to be completed
by November 2021, again facilitating a successful FDA IND application for PAH. STTR PHASE I is designed to
optimize route of delivery (SubQ vs IM) and dosing of ALT-100 mAb and further validate ALT-100 as an effective
strategy in two preclinical PAH rat models (monocrotaline, hypoxia/Sugen) (SA #1). We will provide proof-of-
concept genomic data validating ALT-100 targeting of the eNAMPT/TLR4 pathway in rat lung tissues and PBMCs
as the mechanism by which ALT-100 significantly halts PAH progression and potentially reverses the severity of
PAH (SA #2). PHASE II studies conducted in rats and minipigs will characterize the PK and pharmacodynamic
(PD) characteristics of the ALT-100 mAb (SA #3) and ALT-100 toxicokinetic properties (SA #4). Successful
completion of these PHASE I/ II STTR studies will enable submission of an FDA IND application whose approval
will allow rapid movement to conducting PAH clinical trials that address the significant unmet need in PAH."

through community-based participatory research (CBPR) and public health interventions that are considerate
of and consistent with communities’ cultural beliefs. Montana communities face severe health disparities that
affect health equity and quality of life among its citizens. As the only center at Montana State University
focusing on Indigenous and rural health, and as a research center for the state of Montana as designated by
the Montana University System Board of Regents, CAIRHE will work during its COBRE Phase III period to
combine rigorous science and interventions with thoughtful community engagement in its Pilot Projects
Program and other studies conducted by Center faculty. The overarching aim of the Center’s COBRE Phase III
grant is to continue to develop CAIRHE as a robust and sustainable multidisciplinary center for health equity
research, and to apply the Center’s Career Guidance Plan and Sustainability Plan to increase the number of
Center investigators achieving independent investigator status. The Center will continue to develop a critical
mass of health equity researchers by hiring at least one additional Indigenous faculty investigator, by training
early-career investigators in health research design and CBPR, and by training the next generation of
Indigenous scholars locally and nationally. CAIRHE will expand the operations of its two cores toward
sustainability beyond Phase III, when each will function as vital pieces of MSU’s research infrastructure with
significant institutional support. First, during the period CAIRHE will enhance its collaborative Montana IDeA
Community Engagement Core (CEC), shared with Montana INBRE at MSU, to support community-engaged
research by a growing number of investigators across the university, and to create an online training program
available nationwide. The CEC also will expand its use of the Health Education and Research Bus (HERB),
serving rural and frontier communities across the state. Second, the Center will continue to expand
translational biomedical research capacity within both the Center and the university at large through the
Translational Biomarkers Core established during Phase I. As part of the Center’s broader Sustainability Plan,
CAIRHE will continue to build its regional Health Equity Network of partners—including clinical organizations,
public health agencies, foundations, and other stakeholders—in order to expand health equity research,
collaboration, funding sources, dissemination, and implementation. New, large-scale collaborations, such as
CAIRHE’s recent National Cancer Institute U54 center with the Huntsman Cancer Institute, titled HOPE &
CAIRHE 2gether, will be another way that the Center will support its important work in the years ahead."
10931826,"The overarching aim of the Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity, or CAIRHE, is to position itself
as the state and regional leader in multidisciplinary health equity research and to increase the number of
Center investigators achieving independent status. The PD/PI and support staff of the Administrative Core will
execute the Organization and Management Plan to provide administrative and fiscal leadership of the research
center at Montana State University, drawing on counsel from the Advisory Committee (AC) and Internal Mentor
Council. On a wider scale, the Core will provide leadership statewide and across the region in Indigenous and
rural health equity through collaborative research and educational partnerships. Internal evaluation will focus
on key benchmark questions and indicators related to the Pilot Projects Program and its faculty mentoring; the
career development of faculty investigators under the Career Guidance Plan; progress toward sustainability of
the Montana IDeA Community Engagement Core (CEC) and the Translational Biomarkers Core; and the Plan
for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP). The Center will continue its successful Pilot Projects Program to
increase the number and capacity of health equity researchers at MSU. With oversight by the PD/PI, in
addition to the AC and the Internal Mentor Council, the Career Guidance Plan involves both individual and
team mentoring of these early-career investigators. The Core also will provide fiscal management for the
project leaders and external grant development services necessary for their career development and their
transition to, and attainment of, independent researcher status. The Administrative Core will work closely with
the CEC to develop and sustain collaboration with partners belonging to the Center’s innovative Health Equity
Network. One particular focus of COBRE Phase III will be to leverage the Health Equity Network for the
dissemination and implementation of successful partnership-driven research outcomes among communities in
need across the state and region. Finally, the Core will enhance the Center’s Sustainability Plan to guide
CAIRHE in the transition from COBRE funding to other competitive grant support during COBRE Phase III and
beyond. Upon achieving its Aims by the completion of Phase III, the Administrative Core will have further
established a highly visible and effective collaborative, multidisciplinary center—with sustainable cores—
focused on health equity research. Through the successful execution of CAIRHE’s Career Guidance Plan and
Sustainability Plan, a growing number of independent investigators within the Center will position CAIRHE for
success beyond COBRE Phase III as an institutionalized center that is a permanent contributor to the
biomedical research capacity at Montana State University."
10931827,"The Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity (CAIRHE) achieves its research mission through
multidisciplinary community-based participatory research (CBPR) that is considerate of and consistent with
communities’ cultural beliefs. Community involvement in every phase of the research, from design to
dissemination, results in the most effective inquiry and intervention because the greatest knowledge of the
health disparities plaguing Montana’s frontier region resides in the communities themselves. Since its
inception, the Center has relied upon strong community engagement to build effective community-investigator
partnerships across Montana, including seven Indigenous reservations and many isolated rural areas, and to
train investigators in best practices of CBPR. CAIRHE has developed a growing network of communities,
health care providers, public health agencies, and other stakeholders working together to improve health
outcomes for Montana’s most vulnerable populations. Beginning with COBRE Phase I, CAIRHE and its
Institutional Development Award (IDeA) partner at MSU, Montana INBRE, formed the innovative Montana
IDeA Community Engagement Core (CEC). Through shared resources and cross-program collaboration, the
CEC eliminates redundancy between the two IDeA programs, and it enables cost efficiencies and more
conscientious stewardship of taxpayer resources. Continuing throughout Phase III, CAIRHE will contribute to
the success of the Core through its support of Community Research Associates, development of Community
Advisory Boards, maintenance and management of the Core’s Health Education and Research Bus (HERB),
and implementation of the new Core Business Plan. In addition to the CEC’s existing portfolio of training tools
spanning introductory to advanced topics, the Core will create an online hub for training researchers in best
practices for community-engaged research with rural and tribal partners. The Core is working with partners at
the Institute of Translational Health Sciences (ITHS) at the University of Washington and the Huntsman Cancer
Institute at the University of Utah to apply expertise on both sides to build a solid educational platform for
investigators. Finally, the Core will leverage CAIRHE’s Health Equity Network to increase the dissemination,
implementation, and impact of research. On the front end of the research process, the Core will offer
academic-community partnership training for disseminating research statewide and regionally. As pilot projects
and other Center-supported studies draw to an end—with the full cooperation of the Center’s community and
stakeholder partners—the Network will help CAIRHE share its successful research outcomes and interventions
so that they can be replicated in other communities in Montana and the Mountain West region facing similar
health challenges. In turn, partners will continue to recommend research needed from CAIRHE investigators to
respond to pressing local and statewide health issues."
10922049,"End stage kidney disease (ESKD) afflicts almost 808,000. Dialysis, the only currently available
treatment except for a kidney transplant, is one of the most expensive items in the Medicare
budget. Patients on dialysis have a poor quality of life and high mortality rates. Spending hours
tethered to dialysis machines in clinics, the patients’ daily activities and social interactions are
greatly restricted. Current dialysis treatment delivers an average of 12 weekly hours of blood
filtration – significantly less than the weekly 168 hours of filtration provided by healthy native
kidneys. The limited blood filtration leads to inadequate control of intravascular volume,
insufficient removal of uremic toxins and failure to maintain electrolyte homeostasis – all resulting in poor clinical outcomes.
Wearable Artificial Organs (WAO), a California based small business, has developed a
miniaturized Wearable Artificial Kidney (WAK) that closely mimics the function of healthy native
kidneys, and is worn on the patient's body allowing complete mobility during dialysis. Earlier
versions of the WAK have been tested in bench, animal, and human studies in major centers
around the globe, proving the concept's feasibility. While most of the targeted biological outcomes were met and patients responded positively, the prototypes used in the trials were too heavy and bulky to satisfy the requirements expressed by dialysis patients. As per patient's preferences, a smaller, discrete, and lighter WAK has been developed. The WAK3 system will be comprised of two devices: 1. a wearable, battery powered, dialysis device, weighing approximately 2 lbs. that uses a double channel opposite phase pulsatile pump, a dialyzer and a charcoal sorbent cartridge. This device will remove uremic toxins, salts and excess water; and 2. a stationary device containing additional sorbents to remove urea and phosphorus. The stationary device will connect only to the dialysis circuit of the wearable device, not the blood circuit. This device will operate while the patient is at rest and the wearable device’s batteries are recharging. This is a key innovation in the field. In Aim 1, a clinical trial will be carried out in 10 ESKD patients who will dialyze with the WAK3 for 2 days at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and then 5 days at home. In Aim 2, a pivotal clinical trial will be conducted. At Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 15 patients will be dialyzed with the WAK3 homes for 21 days. These trials will establish that the WAK3 can safely and efficiently deliver superior clinical outcomes and improved quality of life at reduced costs. Upon completion, this project will provide the FDA with the data needed to approve a PMA application to go to market."
10922569,"Project Summary
A significant portion of newborns (6-10%) enter neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in the U.S. and without
adequate nutrition, this vulnerable population could suffer from long-term consequences. Total parenteral
nutrition (TPN) is crucial for the care of premature infants in NICUs not only for growth but also for improving
other health outcomes. However, current practices of TPN administration are expensive, lack scientific support,
and have low accessibility. The process is also the most cited error within NICUs, potentially leading to
adverse outcomes in infants.
The goal of this proposal is to address these drawbacks by developing an FDA-approved artificial intelligence
(AI)-driven TPN platform (TPN2.0) derived from our unique data collected over 10 years that link TPN
composition to adverse outcomes. The model would also be built on our prior work that predicts adverse
outcome risks in newborns based on maternal and child electronic health records. The platform development
will be accomplished through two steps. First, we will develop a set of standardized TPN units whose number
is manageable for central manufacturing, leveraging the benefits of standardized units, without sacrificing their
personalization. This is based on our proven hypothesis that similar TPN compositions can be grouped
together without noticeable changes in clinical decisions. Second, we will validate our TPN2.0 platform in real
clinical settings to show non-inferiority performance to the best standard of care.
In Phase 1, our initial focus is on developing an AI model that groups infants based on their profiles and
suggests corresponding TPN compositions. This involves using an advanced transformer model with a
clustering layer that takes advantage of the longitudinal nature of lab test values and TPN data. To validate the
model, we plan to involve healthcare professionals in a study where they evaluate different solutions. In Phase
2, we aim to further validate this approach across larger multi-site groups of professionals. Additionally, we'll
work on software development for submission to regulatory authorities, seeking approval for a Class II SaMD.
Our validation studies and regulatory pathways have been guided by consultations with a regulatory
consultant. Early results are promising, resulting in the creation of a standardized set of TPN solutions suitable
for multi-site testing. Notably, evaluations from experts favored our solution over individual prescriptions.
Furthermore, the analysis revealed a lower incidence of certain adverse outcomes with TPN2.0 compared to
prescriptions. While not required for regulatory approval, we will also conduct a clinical pilot where actual
newborns would receive TPN2.0 units, enabling us to gather performance data for comparison. These findings
will support our product and lay the groundwork for potential sales and broader pilot initiatives."
10921113,"ABSTRACT
Cancer is projected to affect 20M people worldwide in 2023, with new cases increasing almost 30% in the next
two decades. Cancer is a complex disease caused by a vast range of genetic and epigenetic defects. Existing
technologies often fall short in comprehensively identifying the various genetic aberrations underlying different
cancer types. A significant number of cancers remain without detected actionable or causative variants,
revealing a critical gap in our understanding, and delaying or preventing the use of targeted treatments. To
address this gap, we have developed an innovative Hi-C workflow that we call VariLink™. VariLink overcomes
many of the limitations of current genomic technologies and substantially enhances the detection of cancer-
driving structural variants (SVs) in the genome. By leveraging the 3D structure of the genome to incorporate
long-range linkage information into the sequencing library, VariLink enables highly sensitive detection of large
SVs, while maintaining shotgun-like detection of smaller variants such as small nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
insertions/deletions (indels). VariLink also overcomes the drawbacks of other commercially available Hi-C
technologies with its 1) rapid workflow (<8 hours vs. 2-3 days); and 2) unbiased genome coverage, enabling
more accurate variant calling. By combining and exceeding the capabilities of existing methods, VariLink can
uncover a broader spectrum of genetic and epigenetic changes in a single assay from a single sample. In our
Phase I-equivalent work, we performed initial development of VariLink and demonstrated its performance
relative to existing Hi-C assays. We also showed feasibility in clinically relevant tissue types, including blood.
Importantly, we showed that VariLink detects SVs at much higher sensitivity than standard whole-genome
sequencing technologies. In our Phase II work, we aim to further validate the performance of VariLink across
multiple clinical sample types and compare it to standard molecular cytogenetic technologies. We also aim to
adapt VariLink for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and develop high-throughput automation
and data analysis protocols. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate VariLink's performance in
comprehensive variant detection and its suitability for commercialization in the translational research and
clinical oncology space. By enabling more sensitive detection of genetic alterations in cancer patient samples,
VariLink could contribute to improved targeted therapies, drug discovery, and reduced cancer mortality. With a
focus on the expansive cancer diagnostics market, we anticipate VariLink's eventual adoption as a diagnostic
test, pushing cancer genomic characterization beyond the limitations of current assays."
10921447,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Bacterial plasmid manufacture is now a major bottleneck in viral gene therapy production workflows.
Although supercoiled plasmid-based vectors are the current industry standard for transient transfection
of packaging cells, minimized DNAs offer substantial safety and efficiency advantages. Currently, there
is a dearth of technologies to produce packaging and payload DNAs in a completely synthetic, abacterial
manner. In fact, no minimized DNA technology capable of scalable synthetic production of supercoiled
and completely scarless DNAs exists. Supercoiling is the preferred topology for circular DNAs given that
their performance in transient transfections is superior to other DNA forms. Minicircles or minivectors
generated by recombination in bacteria are supercoiled but require extensive and expensive purification
and yield a final product ‘scarred’ by a variable length prokaryotic sequence. Doggybone DNAs (dbDNAs)
comprised of linear double stranded DNA with circularized single-stranded ends are produced
synthetically but are not supercoiled. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an efficient bacteria-
independent workflow to produce, at a commercially viable scale, completely vectorless supercoiled
DNAs (VLSDNAs). This will be achieved using a new DNA assembly technology we have developed
termed cyclic heteroduplex thermostable ligation assembly (CHTLA). The objectives of the work
proposed here are to 1) optimize CHTLA reaction conditions to maximize supercoil production and
eliminate byproducts; and 2) to produce VLSDNAs encoding all packaging, replication, and payload
components to generate adeno-associated virus (AAV) particles loaded with a green fluorescent protein
(GFP) reporter gene. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) of a standardized green fluorescent protein (GFP)
gene expression cassette will be used to generate milligram quantities of overlapping and offset DNA
precursors for CHTLA reactions. To maximize supercoiling of CHTLA products, a two-enzyme, one-pot
system will be developed containing both thermostable DNA ligase and thermostable DNA gyrase activity.
The work proposed here is highly innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status
quo by developing a robust new technology to produce, entirely in vitro, DNAs with a supercoiled topology
that are comprised exclusively of the sequence of interest. VLSDNA versions of pHelper-Kan, pAAV-Rep-
Cap, and pAAV ITR-GFP encoding adenovirus E1A, E1B, E2A, E4 and VA RNA open reading frames will
be generated using standard as well as optimized conditions identified in Aim 1. VLSDNAs will be
quantitatively compared to standard bacterially-sourced pHelper-Kan, pAAV-Rep-Cap, and pAAV ITR-
GFP triple plasmid transfection by commercial collaborator. Upon completion of these Aims we will have
determined optimal conditions to generate functional VLSDNAs at a scale that is commercially viable. In
Phase 2, we will seek to further scale production toward the gram+ quantities that will be required to
serve customers in the AAV and lentivirus (LV) gene therapy sectors."

challenges – translational science (TS) competency training that is a foundation for life-long learning and high
impact research; advancing a culture of inclusive excellence – and solutions, training innovations which we
have started to implement in our KL2 and will expand in the proposed K12. Our overarching goal is to train and
nurture diverse clinical and translational scientists to be resilient leaders of high-functioning, interdisciplinary
teams, leaders who are well positioned to tackle translational roadblocks and procure external funding, and
who employ implementation science (IS) principles and partner with affected/interested groups and end-users.
We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1) Provide K12 structure including communication, advisory
support, oversight, and integration with the UM1 and T32 and other institutional training programs, to optimize
effectiveness and efficiency of operations; Aim 2) Model interdisciplinary collaboration through diverse and
dedicated Program Faculty to help fill gaps in Scholar mentoring and require all faculty to complete 1 of 2
offered options of mentor training; Aim 3) Promote diversity of applicants through (a) outreach, including to, as
stated in NIH NOT-OD-20-031, “underrepresented populations in the U.S. biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and
social sciences research enterprise” based on race, ethnicity, disadvantaged background, and disability, and
(b) K12 application support; Aim 4) Build an ESI Academy, an inclusive near-peer community of K12 Scholars
and any K- or R-aspirer, including ESI Academy Socials and a seminar series with core and elective content
for the Scholars; Aim 5) Personalize Scholar training using (a) a baseline assessment of TS and translational
research competencies, (b) identification of the desired mastery level for each competency, and (c) an
individualized training roadmap, using a novel tool – which we call COMPASS (Competency Assessment and
Pathway Development) – to prioritize and monitor proficiency development; Aim 6) Provide enhanced
approaches such as: (a) an active learner model with Scholars as PI of their training roadmap, (b) training that
is non-siloed, i.e., delivered by cross-disciplinary mentors, (c) hybrid and online delivery, archived for efficient

10918141,"Abstract
Stroke survivors often experience a debilitating loss of motor control typically affecting one side of the body.
When performing upper-extremity (UE) movements during activities of daily living (ADLs), stroke survivors
naturally favor using the more functional UE, thus leading to restricted use of the hemiparetic UE thereby
hindering motor recovery. While therapists use conventional techniques to target the hemiparetic UE during
clinical visits, patients receive limited direct training on the use of their hemiparetic UE in their home environment.
The lack of therapeutic training in the home environment negatively impacts the recovery of UE motor function.
Yet, motor improvements are achievable with sufficient motor practice. Based on this body of evidence, through
our completed SBIR Fast-Track study, we developed a patented sensor-based technology, called StrokeWearTM.
StrokeWearTM consists of a proprietary software and bilateral wrist-worn sensors to continuously monitor UE
movements performed by patients in their home and community environments. The system also generates real-
time feedback on the performance of goal directed movements (GDM).
The objective of this Phase IIB is to further develop StrokeWearTM for commercialization by enhancing the
platform with features that will empower and encourage patients to engage in GDM with their hemiparetic UE in
the home and to support expert clinicians to foster increased activity in a telehealth environment. The system
promotes behavior changes that optimize UE movement patterns for neuro-recovery. In this project, we will
integrate goal setting, self-efficacy, behavioral achievements, and movement feedback into StrokeWearTM. To
better engage the users, we will develop a companion smartphone application that will encourage patients to be
active in monitoring their progress. Finally, we will develop a web-portal that will allow patients and clinicians to
be more engaged and interactive during the rehabilitation program through on-demand goal setting and
consultation. We will conduct two 6-month randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of this integrated
platform in both chronic and subacute stroke survivors. The control group will receive usual care, while the
intervention group will receive the StrokeWearTM platform in addition to a motor and behavioral home-based
intervention."
10918346,"Project Summary
Mitotic chromosome formation is essential for the dissemination of genetic information in eukaryotes.
The conversion of dispersed interphase chromatin into the iconic, X-shaped metaphase chromosome
involves three principal events: the formation of a central axis (the chromosomal “scaffold”), lengthwise
contraction, and condensation. Plausible theories have been advanced to explain the latter two events,
with contraction occurring through the extrusion of chromatin loops and condensation occurring through
a volume phase transition of the chromosomal material. In contrast, little is known about the formation
of the mitotic scaffold, and its very existence has been the source of considerable controversy. Direct
evidence for the scaffold's existence has recently come from the observation of a central filament in
native mitotic chromosomes subjected to controlled expansion ex vivo. This filament could be liberated,
intact, from its chromosomal confines by careful nucleolysis, providing a basis for further study.
 This proposal aims to elucidate basic principles of the mitotic chromosome scaffold, including its
molecular composition (Aim 1), its three-dimensional architecture (Aim 2), and its interactions with the
chromatin enveloping it (Aims 1 and 2). The information obtained will provide a global view of the
core of the mitotic chromosome, explaining how its components assemble into a structure of mesoscopic proportions and how this structure organizes the genome in a manner ensuring its faithful and
efficient distribution. The acquired knowledge will enable more detailed investigations into the mechanisms governing scaffold assembly and disassembly and the nature of its interactions with other cellular
components (e.g., chromatin, kinetochores).
 This proposal also seeks to develop chemical modulators of scaffold assembly (Aim 3). As the
scaffold and its constituents are increasingly understood to play important roles in human health and
disease, such tools will not only enable further research on the scaffold but will also allow for its pharmacological manipulation in clinical contexts. Dysregulation of scaffold components such as the condensins, for instance, has been implicated in a growing number of malignancies, where they contribute
to a particular form of genome instability known as chromosome instability. Genome instability is a key
factor in the evolution of cancer cells, facilitating their escape from immune clearance and their acquisition of therapeutic resistance. By suppressing a pathway leading to chromosome instability, modulators
of condensins (and other scaffold components) may act to limit the evolutionary potential of cancer
cells."
10918465,"Project Summary
One of the key roles of the olfactory system is to guide animals towards things they need and
away from things they ought to avoid. Landmark studies have shown that during such spatial
navigation in visually defined environments, “grid cells” in rodent entorhinal cortex (ERC), with
hexagonally symmetric (6-fold) firing fields, tile the floor of a landscape, providing a metric for
self-location and path finding. Such approaches have inspired parallel studies in humans: when
subjects explore a 2-D virtual reality arena, identification of 6-fold functional MRI (fMRI) activity
in ERC can be used to infer the presence of a grid-like map in the human brain. We have
recently shown that human participants can use odor landmarks to navigate a virtual odor
environment, with corresponding grid-like activity in ERC and piriform cortex (PCx). To follow up
on these findings, we are examining the context-based remapping of grid-like activity in human
ERC and PCx with a paradigm that manipulates the reward value of odor landmarks. We are
also seeking to expand the scope of the parent grant by testing the more general cognitive-map
hypothesis that is thought to underlie spatial and olfactory navigation in hippocampus, ERC, and
PCx. Beyond navigation, the cognitive-map hypothesis posits that the hippocampal formation
encodes a map of abstract relational knowledge that can be flexibly retrieved to predict sensory
information in new environments to aid adaptive behavior. We hypothesize that PCx and the
hippocampal formation act as a functional unit to encode a rich map of abstract olfactory
relations that, once learned, can be retrieved to facilitate perceptual predictions and
decision-making. We will test this hypothesis with an olfactory associative-learning paradigm
under 7T fMRI, which will afford us the resolution to probe interactions between PCx and small
subregions of the hippocampal formation. Using the well-established principles derived from the
cognitive-map hypothesis, this research promises to greatly broaden our understanding of
olfactory coding in PCx and the hippocampal formation."
10921410,"Project Summary
Mechanical ventilation is an essential intervention for many patients but is associated with a risk of preventable
complications and is a modifiable determinant of outcomes. Current standard of care approaches utilize non-
individualized “one-size fits all” strategies which may expose patients to ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) and
other complications often leading to prolongation of ventilation and mortality. We propose that better
understanding individualized respiratory physiology and patient-ventilator interaction using esophageal
manometry and decision support can create more personalized mechanical ventilation and improve clinical
information, ventilator settings and outcomes.
Using esophageal pressure (Pes) provides accurate estimations of transpulmonary pressure, respiratory effort,
intrinsic PEEP, and patient-ventilator interaction that can be used to prevent lung collapse, prevent lung injury,
and optimize lung mechanics and oxygenation. Most major mechanical ventilator settings can be better
optimized with the use of esophageal pressure.
Unfortunately, esophageal pressure measurements are typically labor intensive, require repetitive training for
proper placement, and parameters derived from them are not easily calculated or interpreted. Esophageal
balloons need to be properly placed and inflated and carefully watched over time to ensure and maintain
accuracy. For these reasons, Pes is not commonly used during mechanical ventilation, with most patients
receiving standard ventilator modes/settings.
In this grant, we propose to develop a patented system including decision support for the personalization and
optimization of mechanical ventilation by simplifying and expanding the use of Pes in the ICU. The system will
support the placement and inflation of the balloon, automatically monitor its accuracy over time, and calculate
and interpret key parameters. Our team has extensive experience with Pes and optimization of mechanical
ventilation.
We propose two Aims in this Phase I SBIR grant to reduce the risk of the technology.
Aim 1 – Build a prototype hardware and software system. Although some ventilators include Pes monitoring,
most do not, and those that do are still difficult to use. We will design a hardware and software decision support
system for all ventilators. The system will automatically inflate and monitor the balloon and obtain the required
airway data. The Phase I software system will provide placement support, accuracy monitoring, and decision
support for several key parameters.
Aim 2 – Validate the value and ease of use of the system. Our goal is to prove that the system simplifies use
of Pes and adds clinical value to ventilator care. We will use a Pes part task trainer and simulated patients to
evaluate the performance of 10 RTs both with and without the system and assess the usability and acceptability
of the system.
This Phase I grant will create and evaluate a prototype Pes decision support system that can significantly improve
usability and shows that the IntelliPes system has the potential to bring esophageal manometry into everyday
use, providing improved data and outcomes to many difficult to ventilate patients."
10921608,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Self-amplifying RNAs (saRNAs) are derived from single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, with the genes for the
viral structural proteins removed and replaced with a gene(s) of interest. The viral genes remaining in the self-
amplifying RNA encode the non-structural proteins which form the machinery necessary to replicate the RNA.
With the RNA undergoing repeated rounds of replication in the host cell, there is increased production of the
proteins of interest over a longer period compared with conventional mRNAs. The use of self-amplifying RNAs,
as opposed to conventional mRNAs, reduces the amount of RNA required to achieve similar responses.
Already, there are saRNAs in clinical trials by major pharmaceutical companies. The self-amplifying RNAs do
not further infect cells, as there are no structural proteins to form infectious progeny. During replication, the
positive-strand RNA is used as a template to make a negative-strand product which is then used as a template
for subsequent generation of more positive-strands and, subsequently, more of the desired protein. The goal of
our proposed study is to develop software that will optimize RNA replication when administering saRNA
vaccines and therapeutics. We will use a machine learning approach to develop software optimize to the
replicability of an RNA. That way when using the viral replicative machinery in self-amplifying RNAs the RNA
can replicate repeatedly, increasing the duration of expression for cargo genes of interest. We will test this
system and present data for at least three individual RNA genes optimized. One of the major impacts of our
proposed study will be the optimization of self-amplifying RNA therapeutics, which have been used for multiple
indications including infectious diseases and cancer. Self-amplifying RNAs require less RNA to be
administered, as compared to non-amplifying messenger RNAs, and have prolonged responses. Optimization
of the genetic cargo of self-amplifying RNAs is a critical step in their development as therapeutics and
vaccines. Yet, the only software to optimize protein production in self-amplifying RNAs is still anchored in
translation optimization from a single RNA, not to increase replication of RNAs. Our product adds another tool
in the toolbox for the development of self-amplifying RNAs. Just as many different approaches were combined
to make conventional RNA therapy possible, our methodology can synergize with other techniques to increase
protein production by self-amplifying RNAs."

 Tendinopathy is an age-related tendon disorder characterized by tendon deterioration and is associated with
pain, swelling and impaired performance, and often leads to tendon rupture. Given that there is no disease-
modifying therapeutic on the market, our central goal is to develop and commercialize a novel biologic as an
effective and safe treatment for tendinopathy. The product to be developed is Altenex, a disease-modifying
biologic drug consisting of exosomes generated by allogeneic human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
cells (BM-MSCs) grown on a novel specialized 3D scaffold for the treatment of tendinopathy.
 Altenex is an exciting outcome for our effort in developing a stem cell-based biologic product based on a
scalable production process. Human BM-MSCs from a readily available stem cell bank are cultured on uniquely
engineered “NanoPrime” scaffolds fabricated with electrospun aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers. These
mass-produced scaffolds emulate the 3D microenvironment that carries the physical cues to “guide” the MSCs
toward tenocytic differentiation and, in doing so, secrete exosomes with therapeutic potential in tendinopathy. In
our preliminary studies, Altenex produced from xeno-free development-grade human BM-MSCs was
characterized as typical exosomes. The exosome identity of Altenex was confirmed by its exosomal protein
markers. Excitingly, we found intra-tendinous injection of Altenex, into rat Achilles tendons with tendinopathy
mitigated histologic features of tendinopathy. These encouraging data support the feasibility of developing
Altenex as a biologic drug for tendinopathy consisting of allogeneic exosomes and led us to hypothesize that
Altenex exerts a therapeutic effect on mitigating tendinopathy with minimal, if any, adverse effects.
 To test the hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will determine the efficacies, safety and
pharmacokinetics of Altenex using a collagenase-induced rat model of tendinopathy. Specifically, we will first
identify the optimal dose and dose schedule for Altenex based on histologic scoring. Then, using the optimal
dose and dose schedule, we will determine the therapeutic effect of Altenex on mitigating tendinopathy pathology,
improving tendon mechanical properties, and relieving pain behaviors. Furthermore, we will evaluate the safety
and pharmacokinetics of Altenex. In Aim 2, we will determine the efficacy and safety of Altenex on tendinopathy
in rabbits. Rabbits with a severe stage of collagenase-induced Achilles tendinopathy will be treated with Altenex
and compared against controls. The efficacy measurements will focus on the pathology and mechanical
properties of the diseased tendon, the parameters that have been well-established in this rabbit model.
Furthermore, the safety of Altenex treatment will be evaluated by clinical observations and clinical pathology,
with particular attention to local toxicities due to interactions Altenex with the tissue at the site of administration.
 This preclinical study is a critical step that advances the translation of Altenex toward the clinical phase and
ultimately an FDA-approved drug for tendinopathy."
10908147,"Pregnancy is a ""natural stress test"" that may reveal higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks in early
adulthood, potentially long before the emergence of clinical CVD. Up to one-third of all pregnancies are
affected by an adverse pregnancy outcome (APO), defined as preeclampsia, other hypertensive disorders,
gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction, and/or preterm delivery. Consequently, APOs affect >40 million
women worldwide each year and nearly 30% of all women during their reproductive years. However, long-term
CVD risks associated with APOs remain poorly understood and not well integrated into clinical practice. A
better understanding could facilitate earlier interventions in young women and alter their long-term trajectory of
CVD. Prior studies have been limited by insufficient phenotyping of APOs and CVD, follow-up time, and
statistical power to assess long-term risks. Large cohorts are needed with prospective phenotyping of APOs
and CVD before, during, and after pregnancy, and long-term follow-up. We hypothesize that APOs are
associated with higher long-term CVD risks (ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure, arrhythmias,
peripheral vascular disease) across the life course, independently of familial factors. To test this hypothesis,
we propose to conduct the first comprehensive assessment of prospectively phenotyped APOs and long-term
CVD risks in a large cohort with up to 48 years of follow-up. We will analyze national registry data for all 4.7 M
pregnancies in 2.5 M women in Sweden during 1973-2017 and all inpatient and outpatient CVD diagnoses and
mortality through 2020. Sweden is an ideal setting because it has linkable individual-level data for the entire
population needed to enable this first-of-its-kind study, and CVD rates and mechanisms are comparable to the
US. Our aims are to (1) determine associations between 4 major APOs (preeclampsia, other hypertensive
disorders, gestational diabetes, fetal growth restriction) and long-term CVD risks across the life course; (2)
identify high-risk subgroups of women who are most susceptible to effects of APOs on long-term CVD risks; (3)
assess the influence of shared familial (genetic and/or environmental) factors; and (4) develop an integrated
model for association of all 5 major APOs (including preterm delivery) with long-term CVD risks. The proposed
research is significant because CVD is the leading cause of death in women worldwide, and APOs are
common and potentially important sentinels of long-term CVD risks, yet such risks are understudied and poorly
integrated into clinical practice. It is innovative because it will provide the first comprehensive assessment of
prospectively phenotyped APOs and long-term CVD risks, utilize co-relative designs to disentangle familial
confounding, and develop an integrated model for all 5 major APOs using unparalleled data for 2.5 M women.
It is highly cost-efficient because we will leverage data from national registries in Sweden that are unavailable
or prohibitively costly to assemble in the US. The results will will help improve women's health by identifying
the long-term CVD risks associated with APOs needed to guide early prevention and long-term clinical care."
10909839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Toxoplasma gondii is an important opportunistic pathogen of humans where it can cause severe disease in the
developing fetus and those with HIV/AIDS. Parasite development is critical for its ability to cause severe
disease, yet the precise mechanisms for how it does this are poorly understood. T. gondii is also modulates the
cell that in infects via secretion of a multitude of effectors. Much of the work aimed at understanding how T.
gondii is able to cause disease has focused exclusively on T. gondii itself. An innovative alternative to this
approach is to perform functional and genetic comparisons between T. gondii and its near relatives to reveal
previously unknown mechanisms of parasite virulence and developmental regulation. The parasite Hammondia
hammondi is one such relative, and our work in the prior funding period has developed this organism into a
powerful comparative model for probing T. gondii biology from an evolutionary context. In this renewal we
follow up on two observations from the prior funding period: 1) that T. gondii is unique in its ability to
facultatively regulate its conversion to the quiescent cyst stage and 2) that T. gondii is unique in its ability to
alter the host cell cycle and that this may be linked to suppression of host anti-parasitic responses. In Aim 1 we
use a focused RNAseq screen to identify new regulators of T. gondii development, using H. hammondi as a
natural filter to focus on relevant candidate genes. Success of this Aim is facilitated by the use of new
transgenic approaches for H. hammondi and preliminary data supporting the premise of our candidate based
approach. In Aim 2 we determine how T. gondii and H. hammondi differentially regulate changes in the
infected host cell, with a focus on underappreciated host pathways including DNA damage responses and
cellular senescence. Success of this aim is facilitated by our extensive experience with T. gondii and H.
hammondi sporozoites and in vitro assays, as well as transgenic approaches in H. hammondi that will permit
us to perform the first ever cross-species complementation experiments in this organism. Overall these studies
build on work during the prior funding period aimed at identifying important phenotypic differences between
these closely related parasite species and then determining their molecular mechanisms. We expect these
studies to result in new discoveries of how T. gondii regulates in growth and development and how it is able to
suppress a wide variety of host defenses. Both of these lines of inquiry will identify new avenues for
therapeutic intervention, whether they target the parasite itself or host responses found to be critical for its
survival."

10909840,"Summary: The Lung EArly Proteins (LEAP) Project
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Screening by low-dose CT can reduce
lung cancer mortality among current and former smokers, but the balance of benefits and harms could be
improved by leveraging novel tools to optimize decision making. Our objective is to translate a novel panel
of protein biomarkers to optimize the decision (1) to initiate screening and (2) to biopsy a nodule.
We developed the INTEGRAL panel within the Integrative Analysis of Lung Cancer Risk and Etiology U19
project. We identified proteins to include on the panel by analyzing pre-diagnostic samples collected up to 3
years before diagnosis among over 700 lung cancer case-control pairs in prospective cohort studies. The
proteins improved the AUC of a smoking-based model by 0.15, with improvements across histological
types. The Lung EArly Proteins (LEAP) project will carry out two late-stage translational studies to evaluate
the potential to implement this panel in two key contexts.
Aim 1 will determine whether repeated measurements of protein markers over time can better predict
development of lung cancer than a single measurement. A repeat-measures model for lung cancer will be
developed using blood samples (up to 5 per participant) from 546 lung cancer cases and 546 controls in
the Prostate, Lung, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, and independently validated using samples from
539 cases and 539 controls from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial. We hypothesize that the AUC of
the model with repeat measurements will be higher than for a model with a single measurement.
Aim 2 will determine whether the protein markers can identify cancers among high-risk screen-detected
lung nodules. A biomarker-based prediction model for nodule malignancy will be developed using blood
samples from 685 participants (131 cancers) in the Pittsburgh Lung Screening Study, and then validated
among 830 participants (213 cancers) in the Multicentric Italian Lung Detection (bioMILD) trial and the St
Elizabeth Lung Cancer Screening program. We hypothesize that the AUC of the biomarker model will be
higher than for an established, validated nodule malignancy prediction model (the Brock model).
The LEAP project will clearly define the contexts in which the INTEGRAL panel is clinical useful. Our
mission is to reduce lung cancer mortality by optimizing a proven and effective screening intervention,
using novel tools to extend its benefits to all high-risk individuals and reduce screening harms."
10909841,"Adolescent alcohol use leads to persistent neural adaptations and behavioral dysregulation that increase the
risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). Acute alcohol reduces pain, and chronic pain (e.g., hyperalgesia)
can promote alcohol drinking through negative reinforcing analgesic effects. Paradoxically, chronic alcohol
produces hyperalgesia or worsen pre-existing pain states. Recently, we reported that medial central amygdala
(CeA) projections to a midbrain region called the periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) are critical for mediating
hyperalgesia in chronically alcohol exposed adult male rats. This chronic alcohol weakens synaptic connectivity
between medial CeA and vlPAG in adult male rats, photostimulation of the CeA-vlPAG circuit rescues
hyperalgesia in alcohol-dependent adult rats, and photoinhibition of this circuit produces hyperalgesia in naïve
rats. Our lab and others find that antagonism of corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors (CRFR1) in CeA
reduces hyperalgesia associated with alcohol withdrawal, nicotine withdrawal and traumatic stress in adult rats.
Our overarching hypotheses are that chronic intermittent alcohol exposure in adolescent rats (AIE) produces
persist long-term effects on polymodal (i.e., mechanical and thermal) hyperalgesia that is mediated by weakened
CeA-vlPAG connectivity and increased CRFR1 signaling in CeA. The CRFR1 signaling gating of CeA-vlPAG
function is important for mediating AIE-induced hyperalgesia.
We include preliminary data showing that 1) AIE produces rapid and long-lasting thermal and mechanical
hyperalgesia during adolescence and that this effect persists into adulthood (Fig. 1), 2) AIE reduces synaptic
drive and excitatory/inhibitory ratio on vlPAG-projecting medial CeA neurons in adulthood (Fig. 3), 3) CRFR1 is
expressed on vlPAG projecting cells (Fig. 2), and 4) validation data for a CRFR1:cre rat for CRFR1+ cell type-
specific modulation of CeA outputs (Fig. 4). Because we also propose to challenge rats with a short-lasting
inflammatory pain challenge in adulthood, we have also piloted dose-response effects of carrageenan on
nociception in adult Wistar rats. Here, we propose aims that will test the hypotheses that AIE produces
hyperalgesia during adolescence that persists into adulthood (Specific Aim 1), that AIE reduces synaptic drive
and excitatory/inhibitory balance of synaptic transmission onto vlPAG-projecting CeA neurons via a CRFR1-
dependent (Specific Aim 2), and that pharmacological, circuit-based, and epigenetic modulation of CRFR1+
PAG- projecting CeA neurons will rescue AIE-induced hyperalgesia and CeA-vlPAG circuit plasticity (Specific
Aim 3). Importantly, we propose specific collaborations with Research Component 6 (PI:Chandler) and 5 (PI:
Crews) along with the Epigenetics Core (PI: Pandey) of the NADIA consortium. This proposal focuses on testing
adolescent alcohol effects on pain-related outcomes and aligns with the overall goal of the NADIA consortium to
examine the effects of adolescent alcohol exposure on the adult organism."
10909951,"Ukraine, an emblematic LMIC in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA), is the only world region with
increasing HIV incidence and mortality. Among the 360,000 PWH in Ukraine, OPWH account for 25% of people
with HIV but are 1.7 times more likely to have AIDS at diagnosis, 51% less likely to start ART, and 3.6 times
more likely to be lost to follow-up than those <50 years old. PWH who disclose their HIV status are more likely
to achieve better social support and HIV outcomes. But in Ukraine 66% of OPWH have not disclosed their HIV
status and are 20% less likely to adhere to ART in the last month, and twice less likely to adhere to therapy for
non-HIV comorbidities, than peers who disclosed. As long-term geriatric care outside of the family in Ukraine is
limited, HIV disclosure decision to support networks is essential when planning for HIV care over aging. But
disclosure interventions to date have prioritized sexual/IDU partner notification and maternal and child health
care, while overlooking disclosure to OPWH support networks. Decision Aid (DA) can facilitate informed
decisions based on patient's unique needs and values. With input from Community Working Group (CWG) we
established in Ukraine, we intend to tailor DA for OPWH using ADAPT-ITT, an evidence-based adaptation
strategy, to develop PORADA (Pursuing Optimal Results over Aging via Decision Aid, “porada” means “advice”
in Ukrainian), and pilot test it to assist OPWH make HIV disclosure decisions aligned with their needs. To help
participants weigh pros and cons and empower them to stay in care in case of stigmatizing reactions, PORADA
will include culturally relevant quotes from OPWH representing key populations, and links to local resources like
hotlines and support groups for PWH. During the pilot RCT Research Assistants will deliver PORADA with a
brief consultation to 80 OPWH who have at least one person they consider important to them to whom they have
not disclosed their HIV status, compared to 40 OPWH receiving TAU. Randomization will be stratified by time
since HIV diagnosis and participants will be followed for 12 months. Outcomes will include measures of
acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy. We hypothesize that PORADA will increase HIV disclosure
(primary outcome) relative to TAU. We will also collect data on decisional conflict, supportive vs stigmatizing
reactions to disclosure, social support, intersectional stigma, and several HIV and non-HIV indicators, to
understand potential distal outcomes, which will be exploratory. Public health benefit is high given growing
OPWH numbers globally, high levels of OPWH non-disclosure, and poor HIV outcomes including high mortality.
Innovation is high based on the adaptation of a DA for OPWH, focus on HIV disclosure to support networks, and
assessing disengagement from HIV and non-HIV care. To ensure compatibility with the community, findings will
be shared with stakeholders including a Community Working Group (peers, clinicians), funders (PEPFAR, Global
Fund), and implementers (MoH, NGOs) to inform development of a hybrid implementation effectiveness trial with
wide dissemination of the decision aid in Ukraine, US, and globally."

10909435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Irritability, an increased propensity to experience anger and frustration, is among the most common presenting
complaints in child psychiatry. Severe irritability affects up to 10% of youth in the U.S. and causes significant
impairment and high rates of service use and school suspensions. Normative irritability follows a low, declining
trajectory from childhood to adolescence. However, some youth remain persistently, highly irritable over
development, putting them at the greatest risk for later psychopathology and adverse outcomes, including
depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Currently, there are no evidence-based treatments for chronic irritability.
This is because of the limited understanding of the etiology and mechanisms of chronic irritability. This New
Innovator application addresses this significant gap by identifying predictors and mechanisms of chronic
irritability trajectory across multiple levels of analysis including the brain, physiology, behavior, social experience,
and family/environment. Specific goals of this project are to (1) identify neural markers (i.e., brain function and
connectivity) that predict which child will follow a chronic, persistently high irritability trajectory over time and the
developmental changes in these neural markers that underlie chronic irritability; (2) identify social and
environmental determinants of chronic irritability and their mediating effects on the link between neural alterations
and chronic irritability; (3) enhance prediction of chronic irritability using data from multiple levels of analysis
including the brain, physiology, behaviors, social experiences, and familial/environmental factors. We will
accomplish these goals in a 3-wave longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, with a
sample of 180 children with (n=120) and without elevated irritability (n=60) at ages 8–13 years. Multi-method,
multi-informant assessments will occur annually at three timepoints over two years. Parent-, youth-, and clinician-
reports will assess youth irritability. An innovative smartphone-based, naturalistic ecological momentary
assessment will measure irritability as well as parent-child and peer relationships/interactions in real time. fMRI
will be collected during a novel social vs. non-social FNR task, addressing a significant gap in the field by probing
the role of contexts in frustration-related neural alterations. Parent and youth will engage in two interactive tasks
in the laboratory (conflict discussion and solving difficult puzzles) while their behaviors and heart rates are being
measured. We will first chart within-person irritability trajectories over time using data-driven, person-centered
latent class growth mixture modeling, and then apply machine learning with the multi-level data to predict chronic
irritability trajectory at the single-subject level. This project, a significant leap forward from the current field, will
provide novel, important insights into the predictors and mechanisms of irritability trajectories across multiple
levels of analysis. Results will advance efforts toward development of evidence-based preventions and
interventions for irritability—a top problem in child psychiatry and a robust predictor of suicidality."
10911844,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
While families play a critical role in adolescent management of chronic illnesses, HIV care and treatment
programs rarely engage older adolescents and young adults (AYA) with their family caregivers. Innovative
approaches are needed though, as AYA consistently have worse HIV-related outcomes than adults and lag on
all the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets. With a tripling in HIV-related deaths among adolescents since 2000, HIV
remains a leading cause of death among AYA in sub-Saharan Africa where most of the world’s HIV+ youth
live. This R01 responds to the disparate burden of HIV-related mortality among AYA and the compelling
evidence from our R34 pilot study on the feasibility and acceptability of an AYA/caregiver group intervention
called Family Connections. The purpose of the R01 is to test the impact of Family Connections on AYA
achieving undetectable viral loads (VL). This intervention draws upon principles of Positive Youth Development
(PYD) and Social Cognitive theory (SCT) to increase social and family support and decrease self-stigma
among AYA, so they may improve their medication adherence and achieve an undetectable viral load. AYA
and caregiver pairs will enroll into the study together. Participants will attend group sessions, with caregivers
and AYA separated for sessions and then brought together at the end of the sessions to share information and
skills learned.
Trained facilitators will lead the group sessions to: 1) improve understanding of HIV among AYA and
caregivers; 2) help AYA develop strategies for healthy living including adherence to ART; 3) build the capacity
of AYA to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health; 4) build the capacity of
caregivers to support AYA; and 5) help AYA develop life skills to communicate their HIV diagnosis
effectively and to plan for their futures. The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial with 20 HIV
clinics in the Lusaka and Copperbelt Provinces in Zambia. The design will allow us to compare 200 pairs of
AYA and caregivers at 10 intervention clinics versus 200 pairs at 10 control clinics (n=800 total: 400 AYA, 400
caregivers). Our specific aims are to: 1) assess the impact of Family Connections on achieving undetectable
VL (<20 copies/mL) among AYAs; 2) assess the impact of Family Connections on caregiver burden and social
support among the caregiver participants; and 3) examine if the impact of Family Connections on AYAs’ viral
status is moderated by developmental differences among youth assessed through measures of cognitive
functioning, executive functioning, impulse control, and emotional regulation."
10912000,"Project Summary:
Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated
with major morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce
its health burden. Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge
gaps persist regarding the impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including effectiveness
of strategies to achieve and maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies reduce USD
recurrence. The Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) study is a randomized clinical trial
investigating the impact of increased fluid intake and increased urine output on the recurrence rate of
USD in adults and children. In this study 1,642 participants will be randomized to a control or
intervention arm. Participants in both arms receive a “smart water bottle”. The intervention arm involves
an additional program of behavioral interventions, including financial incentives, structured problem
solving, and low touch interventions designed to improve adherence to a prescribed fluid intake
regimen. The primary endpoint is occurrence of a stone event during a two-year observation period.
The PUSH study is in its third year, and due to multiple challenges to recruitment of study participants,
follow-up of participants and data collection have not yet been completed. Additional time is needed to
ensure study completion and to accomplish all study goals. Although ureteral stenting is routinely
performed after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-operative complications, stents cause
significant patient discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only partly understood. The STudy to
Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS) is a prospective observational
cohort study enrolling adolescents and adults undergoing ureteroscopic intervention for ureteral and/or
renal stones. Participants undergo detailed symptom assessment using validated questionnaires, a
psychosocial assessment, quantitative sensory testing for evaluation of pain sensitization, and detailed
collection of clinical and operative data. Biospecimens (blood and urine) are being collected for future
research. Recruitment to the STENTS study and follow-up of the participants are expected to be
completed on time. However, additional time and resources are needed for analysis of collected study
data. In Aim 1 of this application, the investigators will continue and complete participant enrollment for
the PUSH study, continue biospecimen collection for the NIDDK Repository, analyze the data, and
prepare and submit several planned manuscripts related to the study hypotheses. In Aim 2 of this
applications, the investigators will analyze the data from the STENTS studies, interpret findings, and
disseminate findings through peer reviewed publications."
10923827,"Project Summary 
American Indian communities have been greatly affected by the opioid epidemic with many 
communities being overwhelmed by opioid use and opioid overdose. Among all racial/ethnic 
groups in the U.S, American Indians and Alaska Natives have the second highest rate of 
overdose fatalities from all opioids and second and third highest overdose fatality rates from 
heroin and synthetic opioids. As with other parts of the country, opioids are the main driver of 
drug overdose deaths in California. Within Southern California, surveillance data indicates that 
areas encompassing American Indian reservations have experienced some of the highest age- 
adjusted rates of opioid-related overdose deaths, hospitalization, and emergency department 
visits. While there have been efforts to curtail the opioid crisis, much of this work has focused on 
population-level strategies without enough focus on the community dynamics and local-level 
context of opioid use. The overarching goal of this study is to characterize the changing 
etiology of opioid misuse and overdose risk among Southern California American Indian (AI) 
adults by implementing research methods to promote community engagement and inform a 
timely public health response to the opioid epidemic. Over a 4-year period, we will collect locally 
relevant data from diverse sources (80 interviews, 200 surveys, and population-level data on 
opioid overdose fatalities) to capture emerging patterns of risks and triangulate that information 
to inform the planning and allocation of prevention and treatment services for AI adults. Our 
study will be guided by the following Specific Aims: 1. Identify the epidemic profile of individuals 
at risk for opioid misuse and opioid overdose; 2. Examine community assets and capacity to 
address prevention and treatment of opioid use/misuse and resulting overdose; and 3. Develop 
community-based surveillance tool to inform community action towards reducing opioid 
overdose fatalities. By combining multiple information sources, a more comprehensive analysis 
and accurate picture of the opioid crisis can be generated. The public health significance of this 
study will be to continuously assess the environment contributing to opioid misuse and overdose 
risk across different social and geographical settings among AI Tribes. We anticipate that our 
findings will inform the short-term and long-term planning of prevention and treatment services 
that are responsive to the needs of California Tribes."
10923829,"ABSTRACT
While smoking cessation efforts have resulted in a decrease in smoking and lung cancer rates, lung cancer
remains the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and
women. Currently, at least half of the newly incident lung cancer cases are former smokers in the US. Moreover,
there are racial/ethnic differences in smoking-related lung cancer risk; however, it is unclear of the extent these
differences persist after smoking cessation. Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer has been shown to reduce
lung cancer mortality by ~20%; however, screening recommendations are limited to current smokers and recent
quitters (within 15 years) who were moderate or heavy smokers (≥20 pack-year smoking history), which does
not address risk among those who have quit >15 years and/or who are light smokers. Prior genetic, epigenetic,
and molecular marker studies have shown that differences in the frequencies or levels of these markers, may
help to better understand risk differences across populations. Our data suggests that smoking may differentially
influence DNA methylation levels across populations and that genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical markers of
smoking may be associated with lung cancer risk in a multiethnic population independent of self-reported
smoking data. The objective of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the mechanisms of lung cancer
risk in a former smoker population. We propose to evaluate the impact of smoking cessation on lung cancer risk
across five racial/ethnic groups from the Multiethnic Cohort study (MEC) with disparate risk of disease (Aim 1).
We will conduct an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of years quit among former smokers from the
MEC (Aim 2). Lastly, we will systematically investigate the association of genetic variants and DNA methylation
from blood leukocytes and urinary cadmium levels (Aim 3) with risk of lung cancer. Additionally, we will interact
with the other three projects in this P01 to study the influence of CYP2A6 genetic variants in relation to years
quit (Project 2), the association of genetic variants with markers of the exposome (Project 3) and the association
for urinary phenanthrene metabolite ratio with DNA methylation of AHRR (Project 4). We hypothesize that
ethnic/racial and individual differences in lung cancer risk in former smokers are in part due to variations in
genetics and different biological response to smoking cessation. The findings from this study will expand our
understanding of risk and potential mechanisms for lung cancer in a multiethnic population of former smokers.
This will help to identify for screening those individuals remaining at greatest risk of lung cancer despite them
having taken the major step of quitting smoking to reduce their risk."
10923834,"ABSTRACT
In the United States this year, an estimated 235,760 new lung cancer cases will be diagnosed. The vast
majority of those are attributable to smoking. However, only 11-24% of smokers will develop lung cancer and
the risk among smokers varies significantly. Individual differences in nicotine metabolism can influence that
risk by influencing the intensity of smoking. The primary catalyst of nicotine metabolism is CYP2A6, and we
have demonstrated an association of CYP2A6 activity with the risk of lung cancer. These data are from a
subcohort of ~2200 smokers with nicotine metabolism biomarker data in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC). The
risk of lung cancer varies across racial/ethnic group as does the contribution of CYP2A6 activity to that risk.
In this project, we propose to develop a genetic score to predict CYP 2A6-catalyzed nicotine metabolism and
to determine the association of that score with the lung cancer risk of ever smokers in the MEC. The gene
that encodes CYP2A6 is notoriously polymorphic. The high homology between CYP2A6 and the pseudogene
CYP2A7, the many variant alleles of each, and their unique distribution by racial/ethnic group complicates the
accurate genotyping of functional variants. However, correctly characterizing an individual's CYP2A6 alleles
is integral to the genotype-guided prediction of nicotine metabolism, and to the complete characterization of
CYP2A6 variation in multiethnic populations. The related gene CYP2D6 has similar genetic complexities and
is equally challenging to genotype. However, recent advances have led to the successful application of long-
range sequencing approaches to accurate CYP2D6 variant calling. We propose to use a similar targeted
sequencing approach to characterize CYP2A6 genetic diversity across racial/ethnic groups. The improved
characterization of CYP2A6 will allow the comprehensive study of the role of CYP2A6 variants in tobacco-
related lung cancer and ultimately better identify those at greatest risk for lung cancer and target them for
prevention strategies. The overall hypothesis of our research is that variation in CYP2A6 activity contributes
to the observed racial/ethnic disparities in lung cancer risk, and that the relative contribution of CYP2A6
activity to risk varies by racial/ethnic group based on the prevalence of metabolically important CYP2A6
variants. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To characterize the genetic diversity of CYP2A6 in
Native Hawaiians relative to Japanese Americans and Whites. CYP2A6 (and CYP2A7) will be sequenced
using the PacBio SMRTbellTM Sequencing platform. Aim 2: To develop a CYP2A6 genetic score to predict
CYP2A6 nicotine metabolism in the MEC. Aim 3: To investigate the association of the CYP2A6 genetic score
developed in Aim 2 with lung cancer in MEC ever smokers with GWAS data."
10923836,"ABSTRACT
About 11-24% of smokers will develop lung tumors over their lifetime, with a greater cancer incidence in
African American and Native Hawaiian cigarette smokers as compared with Whites, Japanese Americans, and
Latinos. These differences persist even after adjusting for smoking amounts. Cigarette smoke is a complex
mixture of chemicals including at least 70 known carcinogens, procarcinogens, and inflammatory agents.
Smokers belonging to different ethnic groups may have variable responses towards cigarette smoke due to
inherent genetic and epigenetic differences and ethnicity-related lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, alcohol
consumption, and environmental exposures. These factors can lead to differing amounts of DNA and protein
adducts in smokers, mediating their sensitivity to smoking-induced mutations and cancer. Recent development
in analytical methodologies and bioinformatics have made it possible to characterize the totality of human
exposures from both external and internal sources (the exposome) using untargeted or multifaceted analyses
of hemoglobin adducts. Hemoglobin is the most abundant protein in human blood with a relatively long half-life,
and hemoglobin adducts reflect cumulative exposures to electrophiles. The adductomics approach is
analogous to other -omics methodologies such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, which are
making it possible to understand and view complex human diseases such as cancer from a global perspective.
Adductomics studies in smokers will capture individual physiological responses to smoking, potentially
uncovering new factors that contribute to lung cancer risk.
We hypothesize that due to genetic differences and ethnic variations in diet, lifestyle, and environmental
exposures, human populations of different ethnicity/race form variable numbers of protein and DNA adducts,
which contributes to ethnic disparities in lung cancer risk following exposure to tobacco smoke. The objective
of this application is to characterize the exposomes of smokers, former smokers, and never smokers, to
investigate inter-individual and inter-ethnic/racial differences in formation of hemoglobin adducts in African
American, Native Hawaiian, White, Japanese American, and Latino smokers from the Multiethic Cohort (MEC),
and to establish the role of the exposome in modifying lung cancer risk. Our approach is innovative because
we will, for the first time, characterize the totality of external and internal exposures using hemoglobin
adductomics in a large multiethnic group of smokers.
Expected outcomes: Our studies will help provide insight into the origins of ethnic variability in sensitivity to
smoking-mediated lung cancer and help identify specific risk factors that play the greatest role in modifying
lung cancer risk. An increased understanding of such risk factors may lead to preventative strategies that will
help overcome ethnic/racial disparities in lung cancer risk and improve human health."
10925213,"PROJECT SUMMARY - GENETIC MODELS OF OCULAR DISEASE & BIOSTATISTICS
The Genetic Models of Ocular Disease & Biostatistics module (formerly Molecular Genetics and Biostatistics)
has been a mainstay providing essential support to NEI-funded PIs at the Casey Eye Institute. The overall goal
of this module is to provide support for answering fundamental questions about the genetic mechanisms behind
ocular disease. In the past, this core has provided two services: (1) DNA isolation from blood samples, saliva
and tissue. Having a dedicated facility for the isolation of DNA ensures maximal DNA yield from patient material
and reduces exposure to hazardous biological materials; 2) support for biostatistical analyses, which allows NEI
investigators access to the most advanced statistical techniques ensuring that the appropriate methods are used
both in the study design phase as well as for data analysis. Projects include analysis of complex gene expression
arrays and RNA-seq datasets, large proteomics studies using TMT tags, optical coherence tomography (OCT)
and OCT angiography (OCTA), bioinformatics and clinical research studies. While maintaining these two critical
services, the Genetic Models of Ocular Disease & Biostatistics core has been expanded to offer two additional
resources: (3) genotyping of cell, tissue and biological samples from a variety of species (including human, non-
human primates, rat, mouse and pig). Genotyping using the QuantStudio real-time PCR machine and TaqMan
chemistry is more cost-effective than traditional Sanger DNA sequencing; and (4) Establishing primary cell
cultures from ocular tissues, as well as fibroblasts from patients with ocular disease. In the age of precision
medicine, it is important to offer core services that reflect individual variability in genes and identifying gene
variants associated with various ocular diseases. Moreover, offering both cell culture and genotyping services
allows functional genotype-phenotype studies to be performed. Combined, these four services will enable our
researchers to streamline their efforts to identify new molecular pathways involved in disease and should
catalyze innovative avenues of ocular research to rapidly translate novel ideas from bench to patient bedside.
Continuation of the Genetic Models of Ocular Disease & Biostatistics core will be instrumental in assisting new,
as well as established, investigators at OHSU in obtaining NEI funding in the next 5 years."
10925217,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE – ABSTRACT
The Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) Administrative Core (AC) leverages a shared
governance model in order to fulfill its responsibilities to establish mechanisms and infrastructure that promote
planning, communication, interaction, integration, and evaluation that support the broad spectrum of research,
education, and outreach activities to advance cancer health equity. ChicagoCHEC builds on the solid foundation
of a 10-year collaborative track record that includes our first NCI U54 Comprehensive Partnership to Advance
Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) award. The AC, led by a tri-institutional MPI team, capitalizes on the strengths
of each institution and leverages those strengths to build cancer research capacity at two minority serving
institutions University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and to expand
cancer disparities research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University
(NU-LCC). AC leadership is instrumental in guiding our Partnership, identifying resources, building collaborative
ties, capacity building, and helping facilitate faculty and students advancement in cancer research, education,
and outreach within the framework of institutional policies. The AC team from UIC, NEIU and NU-LCC have
worked together in varying capacities for the past 10 years and are a well-integrated team, laying the groundwork
for a strong collaboration upon which to launch and sustain ChicagoCHEC’s next chapter. To guide operations
and ensure best practices and the realization of targeted milestones in all Partnership activities, we will leverage
our established standard operating protocol, a full operations manual, and detailed logic models that guide
Partnership activities and evaluation processes. Our AC is guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and
a Program Steering Committee (PSC). We now plan to further advance the foundation built through our initial
U54 award to fulfill the following Specific Aims: (1) Provide overall support for ChicagoCHEC activities, ensuring
integration, coordination, collaboration, and fiscal administration across the Projects and Cores; (2) Refine and
maintain communication processes and structures to enhance the overall visibility of the ChicagoCHEC
Partnership; (3) Facilitate mechanisms to optimize integration with, and efficient utilization of, institutional
resources within the partnering institutions NU-LCC, UIC, and NEIU; (4) Organize and maintain a robust pipeline
for continuous recruitment of students and faculty from minority and underrepresented backgrounds into this
Partnership; and (5) Drive iterative and robust evaluation of all ChicagoCHEC Partnership activities."
10925219,"PLANNING AND EVALUATION CORE – ABSTRACT
Our Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) Planning and Evaluation Core (PEC) is
comprised of an exceptional team with complementary expertise and responsibility to lead the core’s monitoring
and evaluation activities. PEC members include: Drs. Kristi Holmes and Brian Hitsman from NU-LCC; Raymond
Fuller and Dr. Wamucii Njogu from NEIU; and Drs. Timothy Johnson and Lisa Sanchez-Johnsen from UIC. This
Renewal application for the ChicagoCHEC PEC proposes to build on the infrastructure created, program
progress, and lessons learned from our first U54 award and continue to improve our integrated and responsive

10925221,"RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE – ABSTRACT
The overall objective of the Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC) Research Education
Core (REC) is to increase the number of students from underrepresented populations engaged in cancer
research by fostering meaningful research, education, and community engaged experiences which link faculty
and students of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert
H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC). For this Core, we define students
as high school through postdoctoral fellows. Between 2016 – 2019, the REC launched research education
experiences bringing together diverse students across the Chicagoland area, developed curricula introducing
students to the science of cancer disparities, and built robust networks with high school and local community
college students to encourage their entry into REC programs. In that period, the REC provided structured
summer research education experiences through the ChicagoCHEC Research Fellows (CHEC Fellows)
Program to 65 students from minority and underrepresented backgrounds. The CHEC Fellows Program is an
intensive 8-week summer program that introduces students to a breadth of cancer health disparities research
topics and to the work of leading cancer researchers, provides hands-on engagement with community partners,
and builds professional skills as a foundation for lifelong learning. In this renewal, we seek to sustain the
successes of the CHEC Fellows Program and add programming to further student entry into cancer research
trajectories and further meet the needs of students within ChicagoCHEC sponsored Projects. Thus, the CHEC
Fellows Program will be complemented by development of new career readiness and career development
supports, and an expansion of ChicagoCHEC Laboratory Experiences and Programs (LEaP), which matches
students, including graduates of the CHEC Fellows Program, to intensive, one-on-one mentored immersion
experiences in cancer research laboratories. A diverse and exceptional tri-institutional team of cancer research
faculty has been assembled to lead the REC in achieving its specific aims, which are to: (1) develop curriculum
and support professional development opportunities to increase Chicago area undergraduate interest and
readiness in entering the cancer research career pipeline; (2) refine and sustain the CHEC Fellows and LEaP
Programs for diverse undergraduate students recruited from NEIU, UIC, NU, and City Colleges of Chicago; (3)
link underrepresented students (undergraduates, graduate/medical students and postdoctoral fellows) to
mentored cancer research experiences within ChicagoCHEC Projects and provide career development support;
and (4) implement continuous tracking and program evaluation. Initiatives of the ChicagoCHEC REC will directly
introduce students to cancer research and enhance their capacity to seek out opportunities that will enable them
to pursue meaningful, highly effective careers in this field."
10925223,"OUTREACH CORE – ABSTRACT
Cancer incidence and mortality rates for racial and ethnic minorities and other underserved and vulnerable
populations are substantially higher in Chicago than the national average for most cancers (Illinois State Cancer
Registry). Addressing these disparities demands culturally and linguistically relevant community-driven
approaches. In 2015, a consortium comprised of community members and three major academic institutions in
Chicago, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU), and the Robert H. Lurie
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC), secured NCI U54 funding to establish the
Chicago Cancer Health Equity Collaborative (ChicagoCHEC), which aims to foster rigorous and meaningful
research, education, training, and community outreach/engagement to advance health equity. Through the
original U54 award, the Outreach Core identified community needs, and provided leadership and programmatic
support for community-based cancer education, engagement, and outreach activities. In this renewal, the
proposed activities of the ChicagoCHEC Outreach Core will build upon the existing strengths, prior and ongoing
work, accomplishments, and lessons learned from the first U54 award to elevate ChicagoCHEC’s collective
impact on reducing cancer inequities. A major area of the Outreach Core’s focus for the next five years will be
to develop targeted cancer support efforts for underserved and vulnerable populations. These include the
following non-mutually exclusive groups: people with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, men of color, and
low-income cancer survivors. Proposed community engagement approaches span the cancer continuum,
encompassing prevention, screening and early detection, community-based education, and cancer treatment
and survivorship. Specific aims of the Outreach Core are to: (1) Foster community partnerships and conduct
ongoing needs assessment to identify new and innovative areas of opportunity, including outreach research, for
community-engaged activities that will reach individuals from health disparities populations; (2) Implement
outreach and education activities across the cancer continuum; (3) Foster opportunities for building cancer health
equity research capacity among community partners, faculty, and students; (4) Plan, implement, and evaluate
NCI National Outreach Network activities locally; and (5) Rigorously evaluate achievement and progress of the
Outreach Core’s stated aims using a comprehensive evaluation strategy. A highly effective and diverse tri-
institutional leadership team with complementary expertise will lead these activities, supported by experienced
Community Health Educators with strong clinical and community networks. A Community Steering Committee
will guide the development and implementation of the proposed outreach and engagement activities. The
Outreach Core will leverage each ChicagoCHEC partner academic institution’s numerous ties to Chicago’s
diverse neighborhoods and community organizations in its activities collectively aimed at advancing cancer
health equity."

10920647,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research Challenge: More than 582,000 people in the US experience homelessness each night, and a
staggering 1.25 million people enter the shelter system each year. People experiencing homelessness endure
extreme adversity, drastically increasing their risk of dying young. Although the response to the homelessness
crisis primarily occurs at the local level, local data on homeless mortality is largely unavailable. The limited
existing data show substantial variation in homeless mortality rates by place, suggesting that place-based
factors may impact mortality risk. However, methodological differences in how existing data are collected and
compiled make valid cross-location comparisons difficult. As a result, at present there is no way to rigorously
test how local place-based factors—such as policies, service availability, and economic conditions—relate to
homeless mortality, which impedes the ability to identify promising local policy solutions or interventions.
Objective & Specific Aims: The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify policy-sensitive
drivers of homeless mortality. This objective will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) calculate
homeless mortality rates for each US state and Continuum of Care (local planning bodies that coordinate
homeless services for a specific city, county, or small group of counties), (2) document frontline providers’
perceived place-based risk and protective factors of homeless mortality, and (3) investigate the association of
place-based factors with homeless mortality.
Approach: The proposed study will use a sequential mixed methods design to provide insight about homeless
mortality and its place-based predictors. In Aim 1, restricted-access US Census Bureau data on people
experiencing homelessness will be linked to Social Security Administration mortality records to estimate area-
level homeless mortality rates. In Aim 2, 48 key informant interviews will be conducted with frontline providers
of homeless and health care services to identify perceived place-based predictors of homeless mortality. In
Aim 3, using homeless mortality estimates from Aim 1 and potential predictors identified in Aim 2, multi-level
modeling will be used to test the association between place-based factors and homeless mortality.
Impact: This project will yield the first comparable state-level and Continuum of Care-level estimates of
homeless mortality as well as identify place-based correlates of mortality. This proposal, which crosscuts the
missions of NIA, NICHD, and NIMHD, would have positive impact by identifying potential policy avenues that
could bring to bear improved health and reduced mortality among people experiencing homelessness."
10938150,"ABSTRACT (PARENT GRANT)
The long-term goal of our research program is to understand how cells fine-tune their metabolic programs to
meet their ever-changing energetic needs. Many cell types in the body, from muscle fibers to neurons, have
evolved unique metabolic programs that are essential for survival and proper function. Even within a single cell,
specific processes are energetically coupled to mitochondria or the glycolytic machinery for specialized metabolic
support. However, the underlying molecular basis of metabolic plasticity and its relationship to cellular function
are poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms of metabolic regulation is highly relevant to many disease
states, including diabetes, myopathies, and Leigh syndrome, where metabolic dysfunction is heavily implicated.
In eukaryotic cells, energy, in the form of ATP molecules is primarily produced by glycolysis and mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation. My laboratory combines optical imaging of biosensors in live cells with genomics and
transcriptomic analysis to investigate metabolic regulation in cellular compartments. With these tools, we have
been able to discover novel pathways for stimulation of mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP production in active
neurons during electrical activity. We now seek to understand how energy metabolism is locally regulated
in subcellular compartments and uncover metabolic specialization of functionally distinct neuronal
types. To carry out this work, we plan to utilize our strength in cellular imaging of metabolic function along with
new technological advances to: (1) determine how subcellular organization of the glycolytic machinery regulates
synaptic vesicle endocytosis, and (2) elucidate molecular mechanisms of metabolic specialization using the
available transcriptional profiles of neuronal subtypes. Our study will shed light on both local and global
mechanisms of metabolic plasticity at the subcellular level and across cell types. As such, our findings will be
broadly relevant to the scientific community studying cellular metabolism and its implications in disease states."
10938185,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The U.S. service sector employs 27 million workers, 20% of the U.S. workforce. Abetted by new technologies,
employers in the service sector have embraced surveillance and sanctioning, which affect time and pace of tasks
on the job, unpredictable and constrained scheduling practices, which affect the organization of time on and off
work, and automation, which shapes longer-term expectations for the future and job insecurity. We refer to these
working conditions, collectively, as temporal dimensions of job quality to draw a contrast with purely economic
dimensions of job quality. Although prior research has established a robust relationship between other aspects
of job conditions and health, there is a gap in knowledge about how these new and increasingly prevalent
workplace practices affect worker health and healthy aging. One important reason for this gap is a lack of suitable
existing data containing information on both these emergent workplace practices and workers’ health outcomes,
yet policy makers have already begun to take action to regulate these practices. There is thus a critical need to
collect new data that will allow researchers to estimate the health effects of exposure to these temporal
dimensions of job quality for workers across the life course. The proposed research expands upon an innovative
method for collecting survey data at scale, at low-cost, and with speed from a target population of service-sector
workers. We use the Facebook advertising platform to purchase and place survey recruitment advertisements
in the mobile and desktop newsfeeds of Facebook and Instagram users, targeting those who work in retail and
fast food. This approach allows us to target users with particular employers and/or in specific localities. We
propose to collect repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data from 90,000 workers across the country.
The proposed research uses these data and methods to accomplish three aims. First, we estimate the
relationship between emergent temporal dimensions of job quality and worker health and healthy aging. The
data collection is designed to capitalize on natural experiments to provide rigorous evidence on the health effects
of temporally precarious work. One set of analyses will exploit city and company policy changes to use rigorous
difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods to estimate causal effects of job quality on health.
Second, we assess whether the health consequences of surveillance and sanctioning, schedule unpredictability
and constraint, and automation vary across the life course. Finally, we will assess the social and public supports
that may buffer and mitigate the harmful health effects of these temporal dimensions of job quality. In sum, we
deploy an innovative data collection approach combined with rigorous estimation to take advantage of natural
experiments implemented when labor laws or company practices change. The significant contributions of our
project entail testing how new dimensions of job quality affect health, estimating differential vulnerabilities across
the life course, and gauging the importance of protective supports and policies. Collectively, this research
provides key missing evidence on health impacts of job quality."

The HCSRN-OAICs AGING Initiative seeks an Alzheimer’s-focused administrative supplement (NOT-AG-23-
032) to 2R33AG057806-06A1 to partner with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute with an overarching goal to
develop the tools and processes required to generate high-quality, real-world evidence on the benefits and
risks of novel therapies for AD, such as lecanemab and future anti-amyloid therapies. We propose the
following specific aims to be accomplished through this supplement: (1) to develop and validate an algorithm,
employing health administrative claims data, for important safety-related events relating to anti-amyloid
therapies including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA); and (2) to formulate the processes required
to establish linkages between the CMS registry or other CMS approved registries and health plan data to
address research questions on health outcomes related to use of anti-amyloid therapies not captured by
registries alone. The “Advancing Geriatrics Infrastructure and Network Growth” (AGING) Initiative brings
together the Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN) and the Claude D. Pepper Older American
Independence Centers (OAICs) to advance an interdisciplinary research agenda focused on older adults with
multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). The specific aims under the AGING Initiative R33 are: (1) to foster
research innovation and translation of research findings into practice through a Multiple Chronic Conditions
(MCCs) Research Innovation, Translation, and Dissemination Core; (2) to foster development of innovative
methods under a Methods, Measures, and Data Core; (3) to foster the career development and success of
new and early-stage investigators through an expanded nation-wide cohort of MCCs Scholars. The proposed
project will expand the toolbox of methodologic approaches and data resources, linkages, and validation
studies that can be applied to the portfolio of research conducted under and fostered by the R33. The
expectation is that the efforts undertaken through this supplement will be applicable to lecanemab and other
future novel therapies for Alzheimer’s disease that may receive FDA approval over the coming months and
years, and therefore, will lay the groundwork to provide critical insights into the real-world safety of these novel
therapies to support decisions in their use in patients with Alzheimer’s disease."

therapies for infectious disease, cancer and other ailments, and that training young investigators
in this approach, while providing broad training in basic molecular and cell biology, offers a most
productive avenue for enhancing success in this endeavor. The program is strongly committed
to recruiting and training students and postdocs from diverse personal backgrounds. The IMM
training program will provide a home for trainees in Immunology and Molecular Medicine and
support for training related activities. We propose support for 5 graduate students and 3
postdoctoral fellows. Graduate students will generally be supported starting in their second year
to ensure commitment to the research area and to provide additional information to evaluate
their capability of providing exceptional contributions to the program. Postdoctoral trainees will
generally be supported starting in their first or second year. In general trainees will be supported
for 2 years on the training grant, with additional years supported from other sources. While this
training grant recently completed its 10th year of funding, the grant is the successor of an NCI-
supported training grant (Molecular Immunology and Tumor Biology Training Program, T32
CA009179), which supported immunology research at Berkeley for 35 years."
10933840,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Major causes of sleep deficiency affect around 40% of children at some point and 11% through adulthood.
Causes of pediatric sleep deficiency are defined by adverse dimensions of sleep health. If untreated, early
sleep deficiency can contribute to health, behavior, and learning disparities at kindergarten entry that may
persist into adulthood. Yet, early causes of sleep deficiency are grossly underdiagnosed in primary care, and
few receive evidence-based treatment. Evidence also suggests that sleep deficiency and downstream
outcomes are significantly worse for children with family risk factors such as low income, education, and parent
mental health. Because these risk factors are unjustly borne by children who are Black or living in poverty,
whose families have few resources to seek help outside of primary care, these sleep health disparities reflect a
critical early health inequity. Yet, limited research defines inequities in early childhood sleep health and missing
from this work is the examination of the effects of racism, housing instability, peak levels of screen media use,
and toxic stress on child sleep health. Our long-term goal is to design and test strategies and health policy to
prevent and remedy inequities in early sleep health. Our objective in this proposal is to empirically test the
sleep health socioecological framework to define how comprehensive multi-level socioecological factors predict
inequities in early childhood sleep health. We propose testing 3 specific and 1 exploratory aims: (1) Evaluate
the effect of understudied risk factors (racism, housing insecurity, screen media use, toxic stress) on child
sleep health; (2) Evaluate the effect of socio-cultural and neighborhood factors on (a) family factors and (b)
children's sleeping environment factors; (3) Define the relationship between multilevel ecologies (socio-cultural
and neighborhood, family, child sleeping environment) and children's sleep health; and (4) (Exploratory)
Explore child stress as a mediator or moderator of multilevel ecologies on child sleep health. Our central
hypothesis is that socio-cultural and neighborhood risk factors increase family risk factors, negatively impacting
the child's sleeping environment and consequently predicting worse sleep health. We will test these aims and
central hypothesis in a micro longitudinal study (three time points over six months) of 550 racially and
economically diverse families of young children (20-48 months of age, when sleep health disparities likely
develop) in two geographic sites of the Midwest with rigorous multi-level measures (e.g., Geographic
Information Systems [GIS], self-report, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], actigraphy, and physiological
biomarkers) using structural equation mediation modeling. The project will provide a critical next step to reduce
disparities in young child sleep health problems and their downstream effects. It will also provide the
opportunity for an early-stage investigator to change research directions. The proposal aligns with NHLBI's
strategic plan to identify factors accounting for differences in population health and individual biology."

The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) Computational Biology Summer Program (CBSP) is a
cancer education research experience that will enable 15 computer science and applied math undergraduates
per year to apply their computer science skills to cancer-based laboratory and clinical research under the
mentorship of MSK faculty. Program participants will work with mentors in laboratories centrally involved in
basic and clinical research, with a computational focus to their work. CBSP trainees will also attend
educational lectures, journal clubs and a wide range of seminars, including several focused on professional
development. They will learn how to blend these lessons to present their work in a capstone showcase of their
work at the conclusion of the 10-week internship.
We anticipate that for some of the CSBP participants, this summer experience will be their first exposure to
cancer biology, biomedical concepts, and laboratory research. By providing them with a concentrated and
intense exposure to cancer biology, we will ensure that they will have the proper understanding to apply their
computational skills to help develop novel methods and mine data for insights toward mechanistic and
therapeutic advances. A key goal of this program is to increase the students’ awareness of and interest in
careers as computational biologists. Through strategic recruitment of computer science and computational
biology undergraduates and exposure to carefully selected mentors and research topics, the CBSP will provide
a path toward development of computational biologists capable of informing the vanguard of cancer biology.
The CBSP will enhance the students’ knowledge about cancer, genomics, and academic biomedical research,
and will foster interest in careers in oncologic fields by pursuing the following Specific Aims:
1. Engage computationally fluent undergraduate students with little previous exposure to biology in
 innovative scientific research projects that address cause, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of
cancer
2. Provide CBSP students with additional mentorship to promote their professional development within
 computational oncology and biology in order to foster the trainees’ interest and engagement in
 academic computational cancer research
Through the exposure that the CBSP will enable, we expect to shape the undergraduates’ perception of
computational biology applied to cancer research such that many will pursue graduate studies in this field."
10936681,"Abstract
 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and PD-Dementia (PDD) are all classified as synucleinopathies due to the accumulation and aggregation of a-synuclein (a-syn) the nervous system. The pathological mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration are not completely understood, however the assembly of a-syn into insoluble fibrils is thought to play key role. This is supported by the discovery that aggregation-promoting mutations in a-syn lead to early onset PD with Dementia, including the A53T mutation and triplication of the SNCA genomic locus. Furthermore, recent GWAS studies indicate that variants in protein trafficking and lysosomal machinery confer increased risk for developing DLB and PD. Since a-syn is normally degraded by lysosomes, disruption of this pathway is expected to increase a-syn levels and promote conditions for aggregation. The relationship between dysfunctional lysosomes and synucleinopathies is best described by the discovery that loss of function mutations in lysosomal GBA1, that encodes b-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) represent the strongest genetic risk factor for both PD and DLB with odds ratios of 5.43 and 8.28 respectively. GCase degrades glycosphingolipids (GSLs) in the lysosome, and our previous work showed that GSLs interact and convert a-syn into toxic aggregates in patient-derived iPSC neurons. Furthermore, our group and others have shown that a-syn inhibits protein maturation of lysosomal hydrolases between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi, leading to depletion of hydrolases and lysosomal dysfunction. In turn, hydrolases accumulate in the ER and overwhelm the quality control machinery, causing their aggregation into insoluble species. Our proposal is focused on synergistic improvement of ER folding machinery, protein trafficking, and lysosomal activity. We hypothesize that improving two or all three of these pathways simultaneously will enhance therapeutic benefit compared to each one alone. During the R61 phase, we will use established small molecules to enhance ER chaperones and pharmacological chaperones that directly bind and stabilize GCase in the ER. These will be combined with trafficking enhancers that promote ER-Golgi SNARE assembly and hydrolase maturation into lysosomes. Finally, we will test the effect of direct GCase allosteric activators combined with both ER proteostasis and trafficking enhancers. We use a combination of patient-derived iPSC-neuron models and mouse models to test our hypotheses in vivo. Our assay readouts include protein folding in the ER, hydrolase maturation, lysosomal activity, a-syn / tau aggregation, cognitive functions, and neurotoxicity. Our go / no go decisions will be based on whether the combinatorial treatments synergistically improve lysosomal activity, reduction in protein pathology and improve cognition. The R33 phase will be focused on establishing thresholds and duration of activation that are required to activate lysosomes and reduce a-syn, development of blood biomarkers that accurately reflect brain target engagement, and safety assessments for escalating doses in vivo. Our studies may provide the groundwork for future combination therapies for DLB and PD."
10936970,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The Cole Lab’s overarching vision is to harness unique characteristics of the human genome to gain deeper
insights into the impact of environmental risk factors on human disease. Our research focuses on two key areas.
First, we aim to develop methods that address gaps in the derivation, analysis, and interpretation of phenotypes
and their associations with markers of human health. Second, we utilize these and other approaches to identify
risk factors and mechanisms related to disease, consequently driving the evolution of novel methods. These two
pillars of my lab are synergistic, continually reinforce one another, and will support my lab’s sustainable growth.
Over the next five years, our primary goals are to develop methods and expand resources for the broader
scientific community that improve the derivation and utilization of environmental phenotypes for human disease
research. One, we will improve the curation and optimization of phenotype pre-processing decisions using
genetic heritability as an unbiased metric for phenotype precision. Two, we will use genetic correlation as a proxy
for phenotypic correlation in non-overlapping individuals to evaluate phenotype similarity and harmonize traits
across diverse groups of individuals. Third, to improve the accurate identification and interpretation of the role
environmental risk factors play in human disease, we will extend traditional genetic causal inference methods
(i.e. Mendelian randomization) to better handle excess cross-trait correlation and genetic instrument mis-
specification commonly seen with environmental risk factors. Furthermore, we will use comprehensive sets of
phenotypes in diverse, large-scale biobanks (UK Biobank and AllofUs) to develop and optimize these methods,
and will make the methods and results publicly available for a broad range of scientists to utilize.
Both in the short-term and long-term, we aim to expand public datasets with more comprehensive, meticulously
curated phenotypes. In the next five years, we will link clinical trials with high-quality longitudinal phenotypes at
the University of Colorado (CU) with data available through the Colorado Biobank, including genetics, health
records, surveys, and geocoded data. This will enhance this resource for CU investigators, and specifically
enable our group to investigate the effects of genetic risk on intervention response and clinical-grade phenotypes.
Our efforts in the next five years will support our research focus on applied statistical genetics to identify risk
factors and mechanisms related to disease, with an emphasis on metabolic disease as a model system for which
our group has expertise. In the long-term, this work allows our group to identify novel research gaps for new
method development. Furthermore, our applied research positions our team to best identify the challenges of
uniting scientists across disciplines and skillsets and the gaps in current resources. Together this research and
my long-term vision will empower our group and others to advance scientific discovery by pinpointing causal
environmental risk factors for human diseases, anchoring our research in purpose."

 Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are at increased risk (~50%) relative to non-diabetic individuals
of suffering sudden cardiac death (SCD), most often due to fatal ventricular arrhythmias such as torsades de
pointes (TdP). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, there is the critical
need to identify and validate novel cellular proarrhythmic mechanisms in T2DM. In that regard, we have
identified and validated a proarrhythmic lipid mediator, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), that is elevated in diabetes
compared to non-diabetic patients suggesting that risk for ventricular arrhythmias may be highest for patients
with high levels of LTB4. LTB4 inhibitors are a class of FDA-approved drugs that have been shown to confer
major cardiovascular benefits. Recent evidence showed that LTB4 receptor (LTB4R) knockout or LTB4
inhibitor treatment of myocytes, prevented LTB4-related metabolic defects, supporting the results of a
separate report indicating reduced LTB4 biosynthesis prevented ischemia/reperfusion-induced arrhythmias.
Our pilot studies revealed that LTB4 is increased in multiple diabetes mouse models (ob/ob and PANIC-
ATTAC), induces a profound prolongation of ventricular action potential duration, triggers cellular
arrhythmogenesis, and severely depresses the repolarizing rapidly activating delayed rectifier K current (IKr)
density in guinea pig ventricular myocytes but not in healthy heart cells, consistent with TdP vulnerability. We
have further found that guinea pigs challenged with LTB4 displayed prolonged QT interval, and that this can
be prevented with LTB4R inhibition, suggesting that preventing such LTB4-LTB4R effects may be
therapeutically beneficial in T2DM ventricular arrhythmias. Our long-term goal is to accelerate the rational
development of clinically useful anti-LTB4 agents as treatments for malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The
overall objective for this application is to determine how the LTB4R signaling axis promotes arrhythmia and its
usefulness as a preclinical drug target. Our central hypothesis, based on preliminary data described above, is
that LTB4 through the LTB4R drives adverse remodeling of ventricular myocyte electrical activity and
propensity for ventricular arrhythmias by promoting impaired IKr biophysics and preventing its functional
expression. The rationale for the proposed research is that a science-based determination of the preclinical in
vitro proarrhythmic effects of LTB4 and associated mechanisms of LTB4R inhibition is likely to support the
development of new and promising therapeutic strategies in patients with T2DM. Our experimental studies
will combine optical (FRET, photo-switchable fluorescent proteins, quantum dot labeling, 3D reconstruction),
electrophysiology, genetic and pharmacological tools in guinea pig and human ventricular myocytes. Our
expectation is that, if we understand T2DM ventricular electrical remodeling from a perspective of LTB4 and
downstream pathways, we may be better equipped to provide new opportunities for the development of novel
therapies for arrhythmia progression and prevention in patients."
10938450,"Project Summary/Abstract
Older adults living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are at a sharply elevated risk for
falls and fall-related injuries resulting in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hip fracture.1 After a fall-related trauma,
evidence indicates this population is at a persistently elevated risk for poor outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality,
nursing home admission). One outcome of importance to patients is home time, or the number of days alive
and out of the hospital. However, there are currently few useful tools to help clinicians prognosticate home time
for patients with ADRD. Failure to identify patient subgroups will perpetuate the clinical practice of restricting
patients with ADRD to one common care pathway without consideration of individualized recovery trajectories.
Translating evidence from other clinical settings, the development of tools to guide precision medicine and
shared decision-making can facilitate desired patient outcomes.
Tools to help predict home time could be used for shared decision-making during a critical juxtaposition in the
life of an older adults—the recovery period following a serious fall-related trauma. The parent K76 grant for this
proposal evaluates factors associated with home time after hip fracture, but does not specifically focus on
trauma survivors with ADRD. Early results from our team on the parent grant highlighted tremendous variability
in home time among trauma survivors by dementia status, which is difficult to reconcile with current treatment
pathways. Thus, the overall objectives of this administrative supplement expand meaningfully on the parent
grant research and career development goals supporting additional research and training to 1) develop,
validate, and assess the equity of a predictive tool designed to help clinicals prognosticate home time for older
adults following fall-related trauma, and 2) determine how older adults living with ADRD, their care partners,
and clinicians caring for them could best utilize these predictions to guide care decisions.
Using prediction model outputs as a starting point, this project will inform an R01 testing tailored care pathways
based on these predictions to optimize home time for older trauma survivors living with ADRD."

10939354,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The primary goal of this Administrative Supplement application is to develop a fundamental understanding of
the Alzheimer’s disease-associated changes in brain-wide protein AMPylation. Protein AMPylation is conferred
by dedicated AMPylases, which exist as a single copy in most metazoans. These enzymes are increasingly
recognized to control proteostasis, modulating how and when amyloidogenic proteins, such as β-amyloid
peptide (Aβ), α-synuclein (α-Syn) and polyglutamine repeat proteins, aggregate. The goals of the parent award
(R35 MIRA) are to 1) dissect the mechanistic and physiological impact of FIC-1/FICD-mediated protein
AMPylation on proteostasis, and 2) elucidate the mechanistic basis of protein AMPylation in the cytoplasm and
nucleus. Our research program is utilizing four complementary model systems: the nematode C. elegans,
purified proteins for in vitro biochemistry, human cell lines and in vivo mouse models, each offering its unique
set of advantages to examine the consequences of aberrant protein AMPylation. In preliminary work expanding
from the parent award, we determined that the conserved AMPylase, FICD, accumulates in the nucleus of
Alzheimer’s disease patient neurons, whereas the enzyme resides perinuclear in neurons of neurologically
unaffected brain tissue. Recent advances in tool and assay development now make it feasible to assess
protein AMPylation in human brain tissue by immunofluorescence staining and immunoblotting approaches.
This proposed supplement will allow us to identify changes in protein AMPylation in specific brain regions and
cell types with the goal of defining a pathogenic role for these changes during the initiation and progression of
Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementias. This project will deliver a first-in-kind map of protein
AMPylation in the human brain and establish novel links between protein AMPylation and Alzheimer’s disease.
We will annotate, curate, and rapidly disseminate the data to the broad scientific community prior to publication
to maximize the utility of these data for meta-analysis and systems biology research."
10939799,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The parent award is focused on studying the mechanisms of novel psychoactive agents, with an emphasis on
phenethylamines. Some of these agents are hallucinogenic and induce pronounced long term changes in
dendritic branching and synaptic plasticity (termed as psychoplastogens). Even acute treatments with
dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an agent from a related class (an indole-alkylamine) results in long term synaptic
rewiring. The mechanisms behind these effects are the focus of significant interest for neuropsychiatric disorders
and may have applications for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates they may
work via direct activation of TrkB, but most investigations have focused on traditional targets associated with
these agents, such as 5-HT1A/2A, and few studies have used AD models. We propose to study binding partners
of psychoplastogens and effects of kinase signaling and gene expression in human AD patients derived iPSCs
via multi-omic analysis."
10922052,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mucopolysaccharidosis type IVA (Morquio A or MPS IVA) is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
disease with a prevalence of ~1/250,000 people in the US. It is caused by faulty genetic encoding for N-acetylgal-
actosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), an enzyme that hydrolyzes the glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin-6-
sulfate and keratan sulfate. Deficiency of GALNS leads to accumulation of the substrates in cartilage, bones,
and organs, compromising the tissues and their function and causing abnormal joint hyperflexibility and
weakness, widespread bone dysplasia, stunted growth, and organ complications. Current therapies include
invasive orthopedic surgeries, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT; FDA approved 2014), and hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), which has been performed more frequently in some other MPS variants.
Surgeries performed in many MPS IVA patients include vertebral decompression and fusion, hip reconstruction,
and laryngotomy. The need for ongoing surgeries and associated complications often reduce patient quality of
life, and total mobility loss can occur, requiring a wheelchair. ERT has mild to moderate benefits on organs
and functional endurance, but it does not improve degenerative skeletal and cartilaginous effects of the
disease. HSCT has been used for a limited number of MPS IVA patients, and although results show it
can produce normal enzyme levels in the blood and has some preventative effect on skeletal
degeneration, it lacks curative power and is not usually recommended. Clinical data support our premise
that the continuous cell-based delivery of supraphysiologic levels of human GALNS could dramatically
improve patient outcomes. The long-term goal of this project is to develop an allogeneic cell-based GT product
that will not require the expensive procedure of autologous cell isolation and modification, immunosuppression,
i.e. chemotherapy, and that will have a good safety profile, be relatively convenient, accessible to a wide range
of age groups, and eliminate the need for invasive surgeries by delivery of supraphysiologic levels of GALNS.
Current therapies are not curative because of delivery of insufficient levels of GALNS, particularly to the
notoriously hard-to-reach skeletal and cartilaginous tissues critically affected by the disease. The goal of Phase
I is to obtain evidence of the feasibility and efficacy of the cell-based GT system to systemically deliver a
continuous high dose of the enzyme. There are two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is focused on producing, optimizing,
and analyzing the characteristics of the genetically-modified cells in vitro. In Aim 2, we will test the therapeutic
efficacy of the continuous cell-based delivery of the recombinant human GALNS in a murine model of MPS IVA
that is engineered to engender tolerance to human GALNS and to lack endogenous murine GALNS activity. In
Phase II, we will test efficacy in another MPS IVA animal model and compare strategies to prevent or control the
tumorigenicity of implanted cells. A major focus will be performing studies in preparation for applying for
Investigational New Drug (IND) status from the FDA."
10925194,"SUMMARY
Despite their emergence from distal esophagus and distal stomach, respectively, esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC) and intestinal gastric cancer (iGC) share the natural histories and molecule genetics of a single disease.
Historically, EAC and iGC were among the first cancers to be linked to the prior presence of discrete, pre-
cancerous lesions that can progress to dysplasia and then invasive disease over a two-decade interval. In
both cases the earliest precancerous lesion was an odd ""intestinal metaplasia; IM"" known as ""Barrett's
esophagus (BE)"" for EAC and ""gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM)"" for iGC. These common evolutionary
features have been extended by cancer genetics breakthroughs that place EAC and iGC into single cluster
distinct from other gastric and esophageal cancers. While it was widely anticipated that advances in
endoscopic and ablative technologies applied to precursor lesions would spell the end of EAC and iGC, rates
of EAC and iGC have not appreciably decreased and most patients still present with advanced disease and
poor five-year survival. This dire clinical reality has predicated a broad effort to understand the cell-of-origin of
these diseases, their earliest emergence towards pathology, as well as their detection and pharmaceutical
elimination. A highly collaborative team consisting of upper gastrointestinal oncologists, stem cell and
molecular biologists, experts in murine cancer modeling, and proteomics specialists has employed advanced
stem cell cloning technologies to capture patient-matched stem cells in each of the successive lesions in
patients with EAC and iGC. In addition to the high-resolution phylogenetics afforded by these stem cells, this
analysis has revealed the BE and GIM stem cells are indistinguishable at the level of whole genome
expression profiling down to the level of homeotic transcription factors that define cellular identity. Common
cell surface markers of BE and GIM stem cells identify a discrete population of cells at both the
gastroesophageal (GE) junction and in the distal stomach of normal mice which we hypothesize are the
intrinsic source of the IM for EAC and iGC respectively. These markers have also enabled the cloning of the
corresponding site-specific stem cells, which we find to be indistinguishable gene expression profiles and to be
committed to IM upon in vitro differentiation. In three aims, we will 1) use similar methods to clone the intrinsic
IM stem cells from human fetal and adult GE junctions and gastric mucosa; 2) engineer mouse models for
conditional expression of oncogenic factors in intrinsic IM cells; and 3) identify small molecules that selectively
target intrinsic IM stem cells as leads for therapeutics to prevent EAC and iGC. We anticipate that the studies
proposed herein will provide new insights into the biology and origin of these remarkably similar and
widespread cancers, provide datasets essential for prospective early detection screens, and yield highly
selective therapeutics that eliminate the nascent lesions essential for the evolution of these cancers."
10925416,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application is for the “Trauma Resuscitation with Group O Whole Blood Or Products” (TROOP) trial, a
pragmatic, multicenter, phase III randomized clinical trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and safety of
whole blood, compared with component blood therapy, in trauma patients predicted to require large volume
blood transfusions.
Trauma is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and disproportionately affects the young,
killing those who might otherwise have lived long and productive lives. Injuries account for more years of potential
life lost before 75 than any other cause. Hemorrhage remains the most common cause of preventable death
after injury, and blood transfusion is an essential part of treatment. Modern blood banking practices separate
donated whole blood into components. The current standard of care in trauma transfusion is the balanced
administration of equal numbers of units of blood components (packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets),
effectively attempting to reconstitute whole blood. A renewed approach to blood transfusion therapy in trauma is
to use whole blood from the outset, which has not been separated. Compared with component therapy, whole
blood offers several potential advantages, but there are only a small number of, mostly observational, studies
comparing whole blood and component therapy, and they are very heterogeneous. TROOP will randomly assign
eligible patients to either whole blood resuscitation or component therapy (the current standard of care). The trial
uses a highly innovative, Bayesian, group-sequential, combined non-inferiority/superiority design. The trial has
been designed in collaboration with NHLBI’s Innovative Clinical Trials Resource, funded by a U34 Planning Grant
(U34HL148472). In keeping with recent expert recommendations, the primary outcome will be 6-hour mortality.
TROOP will enroll 1,100 patients, over 36 months, at 12 level I trauma centers. The trial will have 85% power to
determine non-inferiority, and 80% power to determine superiority. We have assembled a highly experienced
team of investigators with significant and complementary expertise in this type of research. The Clinical
Coordinating Center is based in the Center for Injury Science at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and
the Data Coordinating Center is based in the School of Public Health, at the University of Texas Health Science
Center at Houston.
The knowledge gained from this clinical trial will transform the way in which massively bleeding trauma patients
are transfused. TROOP is exceedingly well positioned to improve mortality from trauma, and reduce the number
of preventable deaths resulting from hemorrhagic shock."
10925420,"Abstract
 Partial nephrectomy is becoming an increasingly important treatment for kidney cancer because more
than 60% of kidney cancer cases are diagnosed in early, localized stages. Compared to radical nephrectomy,
partial nephrectomy offers much better preservation of renal function while having an equivalent oncological
efficacy for the localized kidney cancer, thereby significantly reducing the postoperative risk of chronic kidney
disease, kidney failure and cardiovascular events. However, accurate visualization of renal tumor and its
boundary remains a long-standing technique challenge. Although intraoperative near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence
imaging has been tested to identify the renal tumor boundary after intravenous injection of indocyanine green
(ICG), hundreds of clinical cases show that the rate of positive surgical margin has not been reduced because
ICG can only visualize the normal kidney tissues and is not able to selectively accumulate in kidney cancer cells.
While nearly 40 new fluorescent agents are being evaluated in the clinics for fluorescence-guided cancer
surgery, only 2 of them can target and hyper-fluorescently image a subgroup of clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC) (~50% of all cases) through ligand-receptor interactions and these two new probes fail to target papillary
RCC (pRCC), the one with higher recurrence rate, and other types of ccRCC. In addition, the complexity in the
probe design significantly increases the manufacture cost, >100 times higher than that of ICG. The goal of
ClearNano Inc. is to commercialize a safe, renal-tubule-clearable, tumor targeting NIR fluorescent agent, named
“ClearICG” for intraoperative, hyper-fluorescence imaging of kidney cancer including both ccRCC and pRCC.
The success of this project will advance the precision of partial nephrectomy for kidney cancer so that oncological
and renal functional outcomes can be simultaneously improved while overall medical expense is significantly
reduced (~20%). Partial nephrectomy will be the entry market for ClearICG, and its merits over ICG in the long
blood retention and tumor targeting will allow it to further replace ICG in other ICG-assisted fluorescence-guided
surgeries that require repeated injections and higher image contrast (expanded market)."
10922072,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial, polygenetic disease that is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Trends predict that by 2040, ~112 million people worldwide will have glaucoma, and many of those will be
legally blind. Several risk factors are known for this disease, with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and
fluctuations in IOP being the only modifiable risk factors linked to the development and progression of visual
field loss. Because of the critical role played by IOP, the current standard of care for adult-onset
glaucoma includes treatment with IOP-lowering medications that are delivered topically as eye drops.
Unfortunately, notwithstanding the convenience of instilling eye drops at home, patient adherence is a major
challenge making it essential that topical dosage forms be engineered to mitigate side effects and eliminate IOP
fluctuations. A market-based comparison has identified multiple issues with current glaucoma medications, the
most significant of which are: 1) limited options for different drug classes/mechanisms of action that are needed
when tolerance to treatment develops; 2) lack of sustained IOP-lowering action, thus requiring many patients to
apply eye drops 2-3 times daily to avoid IOP fluctuations, which are now known to be highly deleterious; and 3)
side effects¾intolerable orbital and systemic discomfort and hyperemia, iris pigmentation changes¾that
contribute to poor patient compliance. We have identified a new druggable target for the treatment of glaucoma,
as well as a highly promising drug and formulation to address all the above listed pain points and unmet needs.
Previous support from NIH SBIR Phase 1 and R24 awards to the OculoTherapy team allowed us to make
excellent progress on the optimization of a novel, topical IOP-lowering formulation, which addresses all the
major limitations listed above. Our formulation is engineered to be bioadhesive with extended-release
properties. In addition, it is well-tolerated, based on the outcomes of a non-GLP 7-day repeat-escalating dose
exploratory toxicity study. Moreover, IOP fluctuations are eliminated, beginning with the first topical application,
and the effectiveness has not waned after 8 months of daily dosing. The active pharmaceutical ingredient
¾pregabalin (PRG)¾represents a new IOP-lowering drug class and provides an additional therapeutic option
when current treatments fail. Because PRG is a safe and efficacious drug, our regulatory strategy is
streamlined. Our patent portfolio is robust and relies of composition of matter and use patents. Importantly, via a
June 2023 Type-B pre-IND meeting with the FDA, OculoTherapy obtained agreement for our regulatory
strategy, plan and pathway to IND and NDA approvals. Specifically, because of the extensive systemic safety
data that is available on PRG, the FDA has agreed to allow OculoTherapy to pursue a 505(b)(2) regulatory
pathway, which will save both time and cost. This Phase II SBIR application was crafted specifically to perform
the IND-enabling studies required by the FDA prior to submission of our first-in-human Phase IIa IND
application, a critical step to establish our PRG-ME as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma."

Major efforts to understand how brain circuits activity gives rise to perception, mental experience, and behavior
have broadly advanced our understanding of most of the central nervous system. In contrast, the brainstem
circuit that connects the brain to patterned muscle outputs is arguably the least understood. The brainstem also
generates rhythms on its own. Networks of premotor neurons (central pattern generators) control and
autonomously coordinate rhythmic movements such as breathing, chewing, drinking, swallowing, and
vocalization. Understanding this neural coordination is fundamentally important for a host of survival-critical
conditions. For example, disorganization of breathing and swallowing leads to choking, which is a leading cause
of death among children and elderly, and a common manifestation of neurodegeneration. Current understanding
of brainstem central pattern generators, such as the breathing oscillator, are derived from neurophysiological
recordings, but these data are extremely limited. Central pattern generators for drinking and swallowing have
not been definitely identified and there is no suitable model system for study neural coordination of multiple
rhythmic movements. A challenge has been applying emerging technologies for large-scale neurophysiology
and mechanistic circuit dissection to the brainstem in behaving animals. I propose a transformative research
program to map and dissect brainstem central pattern generators that coordinate orofacial rhythms. First, using
approaches recently established in my lab for large-scale high-density electrophysiology mapping of multi-
regional neural circuits, we will map the premotor networks for licking, breathing, and swallowing in brainstem of
behaving mice. Using circuit tracing tools, we will further delineate the organization of these premotor circuits in
terms of their molecular cell types and connectivity. Using this roadmap, we will probe interactions between these
premotor circuits using simultaneous recordings of their activities in conjunction with controlled perturbation of
individual circuits. Finally, we will dissect how brainstem intrinsic rhythms interact with descending volitional
control (analogous to how we are able to adjust our breath when we vocalize) by simultaneously recording the
higher motor centers with the downstream brainstem circuits in mice performing volitional drinking. The outcome
will shed light on why life-threatening symptoms occur in many forms neurological malfunctions that all trace
their roots to the brainstem, paving the way for development of therapeutic interventions."

Teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) remain a problem in the U.S. Although 15-24 year
olds are only 25% of the U.S. sexually active population, they account for over 50% of the 20 million new cases
of STIs each year. While historically low, the U.S. teen pregnancy rate remains one of the highest in the
developed world and racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in teen birth rates persist. The long-term goal of
this project is to support school and community-based educators working to reduce the ongoing problem of teen
pregnancy and STIs in the U.S. Making Proud Choices! (MPC) is one of the most used, evidence-based
HIV/STI/teen pregnancy risk-reduction programs. However, MPC must be implemented with fidelity to achieve
outcomes, and educators must be trained to ensure MPC is implemented well. Unfortunately, lack of affordable,
accessible training options make it difficult for educators to implement the program with fidelity. This project
proposes a cost-effective, easily implemented solution through avatar-based virtual training. These trainings
simulate real-life, two-way exchanges, allowing trainees to practice and get immediate feedback on core
concepts from a student audience programmed to display a range of reactions. This asynchronous training can
be used anytime and anywhere, unlike live remote training. In sum, avatar-based training can help schools and
community organizations overcome limitations of in-person training, provide sustainable, widespread access to
training in efficacious prevention programs, and dramatically improve sexual health outcomes for youth at a
reasonable cost.
In Phase I, we developed a novel, online avatar-based training prototype for select components of MPC. In a
pilot test with 53 participants comparing avatar-based and in-person training, results showed that a) the avatar-
based training was no different, and in many cases better, than the in-person training on improving facilitator
quality and instruction adherence; and b) participants positively rated the trainings’ high levels of acceptability,
usability and applicability to teaching youth about sexual health and safety. For this Phase II project, we will fully
develop and test the 10-module version of the online, avatar-based MPC training. The project has three specific
aims: 1): Develop a full-scale avatar-based MPC virtual training for educators of this STI/pregnancy risk reduction
program; 2): Evaluate the training’s impact on 165 educators of 9th-12 grade students, assessing their
STI/pregnancy prevention knowledge, teaching skills and curriculum fidelity compared to live training and no
training/curriculum only conditions; and 3): Evaluate the impact of exposure to educators from the two treatment
groups on students’ knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding safer sex practices."
10921441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to develop a solution that allows for rapid, safe, and scalable initial treatment and
transport of patients with highly transmissible infectious diseases. This is a necessary innovation because
resource management and infectious transmission control were two of the greatest challenges healthcare
providers faced when fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. When a patient is suffering from highly transmissible
respiratory diseases and requires breathing assistance, they are placed in negative pressure rooms.
However, given the limited supply of negative pressure rooms available to prevent virus transmission, and
the misperception regarding the safety and effectiveness of negative pressure rooms, a new solution is
needed. To help prevent the spread of highly transmissible infectious diseases, start-up company Inspire Rx
has developed a personal negative pressure device called the AerosolVE™ BioHelmet. The BioHelmet is
capable of preventing the spread of aerosolized pathogens while also enabling the use of non-invasive
oxygen therapies on patients with respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, influenza, tuberculosis, measles,
and chicken pox. The negative pressure AerosolVE™ BioHelmet immediately isolates patients with any
highly transmissible respiratory infectious disease and serves as an instant personal negative pressure
environment that is more effective than a traditional negative pressure room. The BioHelmet is intended to
provide safe transportation via ambulance, airplane, or helicopter, allowing critical EMS and transportation
staff to remain safe, and it can also be used in any area of a hospital (including waiting rooms, hallways,
imaging facilities, and any patient room). In this project the team will refine and further evaluate the
AerosolVE BioHelmet, building on their preliminary data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. They will
first refine the BioHelmet design and fabricate 5 AerosolVE BioHelmets and pump units for follow-on bench
testing and obtaining end-user feedback (Aim 1). They will conduct performance and bench testing for the
different device components of the BioHelmet to demonstrate that the device performs as expected for its
intended use, including particulate testing (Aim 2). Finally, they will obtain end-user feedback from clinicians,
hospital administrators, and others to inform final design requirements (Aim 3). In a future Phase II grant, they
will conduct performance and bench testing in FDA approved labs to ensure safety and efficacy, as well as
clinical testing to ensure the BioHelmet can be comfortably worn for an extended period (several days). They will
then submit an FDA 510(k) application to enable commercialization. The BioHelmet will provide a novel,
compact, portable, and inexpensive solution that offers a safe negative pressure environment both inside and
outside the hospital, which will ultimately save lives by protecting healthcare workers while treating patients."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mission of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Research Program is to conduct exceptional cancer
prevention and control research in the YCC catchment area of Connecticut and beyond that informs policy,
guides clinical practice, and drives equitable care. The CPC mission is aligned with and in support of the YCC
Strategic Plan’s mission to conduct impactful research and translate findings into improved prevention and
treatment, with a focus on the cancer burdens in Connecticut.
Xiaomei Ma, PhD, and Michaela Dinan, PhD co-lead CPC. Together, X Ma and Dinan facilitate the collaboration
of CPC members with members from other Research Programs and Clinical Research Teams (CRTs) with the
goal of stimulating transdisciplinary research that will impact cancer risk and mortality rates within and beyond
the State of Connecticut. X Ma serves as a liaison with the Cancer Research Training and Education
Coordination Core (CRTEC), and Dinan is the liaison with YCC’s COE Center for Community Engagement and
Health Equity (CEHE).
There are 42 CPC members, with primary appointments in 9 departments across three schools. CPC has a
strong program-wide emphasis on health disparities research, as well as conducting impactful research in YCC
cross-cutting themes of obesity, tobacco control, and early-onset cancer. Of the four priority cancers established
in the YCC Strategic Plan, CPC members have strong programs of research that align with each of these disease
areas – breast, prostate, lung, and liver cancers. However, CPC members’ research also extends beyond these
priority cancers into many additional areas of expertise, often collaborating with other YCC research programs.
CPC is closely aligned with COE, with many CPC members playing key roles within COE, allowing for optimal
integration of the community voice and underserved populations into CPC’s research. CPC also works closely
with YCC’s Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED) Office to recruit, retain, and promote a culture of inclusivity within
CPC to advance the research and careers of women and members of groups that are under-represented in
oncology. CPC is also actively engaged with CRTEC with CPC members leading two T32 grants, mentoring
recipients of multiple F and K career development awards and leading a nationally recognized NCI R25 training
course in transdisciplinary research in energetics and cancer.
CPC members published 616 papers during this award period, 18% in high impact journals, with inter-
programmatic (29%) and intra-programmatic (25%) collaborations demonstrating interactions among CPC

10939415,"Project Summary/Abstract
Disparities in kidney health is an important long-standing problem in the US. African Americans (AAs) who
represent 13% of U.S population, develop end stage kidney disease at 3.5-fold higher rates than European
Americans, explaining why 31% of people with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) are AAs. Two protein coding
mutations in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene are the causal drivers of 70% of this excess risk of ESKD in
AAs. Despite the urgent need for treatment of APOL1-associated kidney disease (AAKD), there have not been
any therapeutic trials specifically focused on AAKD. This need is compounded by severe underrepresentation
of AAs in clinical trials. Until these needs are met, disparities in kidney health in the US will persist. Our long-
term goal is to develop targeted therapies for the two most common forms of AAKD: APOL1-associated focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and hypertension-induced chronic kidney disease (HTN-CKD) in order
to mitigate the disparate burden of ESKD among AAs. The objective of this particular application is to target a
proximal pathway that drives APOL1-induced podocyte injury, which is a central mechanism of AAKD. Our
central hypothesis is that inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 kinases will block APOL1-induced podocyte injury, and
proteinuria, and thereby mitigate progression of AAKD to ESKD. This hypothesis has been formulated on the
basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratories. The rationale for the proposed research is
that discovery of an effective treatment for AAKD will reduce disparities in ESKD incidence, the high cost of
ESKD care, and the enormous loss of lives associated with ESKD—which is responsible for nearly as much
loss of life-years as breast cancer in women and more loss of life-years than colorectal cancer in men.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Build the
Durham Community APOL1 Program for community engagement and translational research; 2) Perform a pilot
phase II randomized clinical trial of a clinically available JAK1/2 inhibitor in patients with AAKD; and 3) Conduct
an ex vivo clinical trial “in-a-dish” using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived podocytes (iPods) of AA patients
with FSGS and HTN-CKD. Our approach is innovative because it leverages a creative community
engagement strategy to addresses the critical problem of underrepresentation of AAs in clinical trials while
simultaneously studying the efficacy and safety of an innovative treatment for AAKD. It also leverages our
innovative iPod platform as a tool for individualized therapy. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to serve as the basis for a future phase III trial of JAK1/2 inhibitor as therapy for AAKD. The impact of
therapy for AAKD includes reduction of the disparate burden of ESKD, mortality and financial cost associated
with AAKD, which are priorities of NIDDK. Additionally, because of its ability to predict patient’s future clinical
response to a drug, the iPod platform strives to advance personalized therapy of AAKD from theory to reality."
10911675,"Women comprise about 50% of the 36.7 million people living with HIV worldwide and in many sub-Saharan
African countries including Nigeria, ~2 out of 3 HIV infected adults are women. Even more worrisome is the
observation that overwhelming number of new infections in Nigeria occur among young women of childbearing
age, and as such, one-third of all global cases of mother-to-child transmission of HIV occurs in the country. Not
only is the burden of HIV higher in women, the impact of its scourge is far more reaching. HIV is the leading
cause of morbidity and mortality among women of reproductive age in Nigeria. HIV complicates every aspect
of health across a woman’s lifespan, including reproductive health where it impacts partner sero-sorting and
sexual habits, fertility desires and contraceptive choices, pregnancy and delivery, menopause and aging.
Tackling the myriads of health challenges confronting women living with HIV is a necessary step to achieving
the WHO global strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescent health. It will require nurturing a critical mass
of local health scientists and equipping them with the skills to conduct valid research that addresses the local
health needs of women living with HIV. To address these needs, we established the Emory-Nigeria HIV
Research Training Program (EN-RTP). The EN-RTP leverages the research education infrastructure at Emory
University and the partnering Nigerian institutions (Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR); University of
Lagos (UNILAG); and AIDS Prevention Initiative Nigeria (APIN)) to provide state-of-the-art in-country research
training with focus on methodologies, rigorous mentorship, and grant management capacity building.
The EN-RTP training is focused on three main domains of HIV/women’s health research: a) HIV prevention
and reproductive health; b) Challenges in HIV therapeutics unique to women living with HIV (WLWH); and c)
Complications of chronic HIV infection relevant to WLWH. Preceptors are selected based on their expertise in
these areas and their international research education and mentoring experience. We can report that the EN-
RTP is now an established program with a cohesive administrative structure and program plan that includes
both didactic and mentored research components implemented by a multidisciplinary team of in-country faculty
and US-based investigators who have a wide range of mentoring experiences. The short- and medium-term
accomplishments include high scholar productivity (over $3M in grant funding, including 3 NIH K 43 awards
and more than 150 peer-reviewed publications by trainees), fostering robust scientific networking opportunities,
developing emerging in-country scientific leaders, and nurturing the next generation of HIV research mentors.
The EN-RTP has demonstrated a potential to be truly transformative in promoting mentored research training
and the growth of the HIV biomedical research workforce. Committed to the primary goal of capacity building in
HIV research, we look forward with enthusiasm the next cycle – particularly the opportunity to pilot new
initiatives and best practices arising from our evaluation processes to enhance program outcomes."
10913341,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in understanding the immunological paradox by which solid tumors first
metastasize via lymphatic channels into the immune-rich lymph node. During this process, immune
surveillance is disabled, ultimately allowing metastatic dissemination to the precise location where it should be
first eliminated—the tumor-draining, sentinel lymph node (SLN). While notably prognostic, it is clear the
metastatic status of the SLN alone is not sufficient in determining patient’s risk or relapse. Therefore,
understanding the mechanisms underlining this chronic process of tumor mediated regional
immunosuppression, commonly referred to as pre-metastatic niche (PMN) formation in the SLN will lend
significant insights for developing improved prognostic and therapeutic tools to detect and reverse cancer
dissemination early in the natural history of metastatic progression. Our long term goal is to develop
therapeutic strategies capable of overcoming the immune compromise of the SLN PMN and thereby disrupt
the first stage of cancer metastasis. Therefore, the objective of the current work is to mechanistically
interrogate the process by which the subcellular component of the primary tumor lymphatic effluent directly
mediates PMN formation. The central hypothesis proposes that in solid tumors, subcellular mediators derived
from the primary tumor microenvironment actively traffic through the lymphatics and in a cargo-dependent
manner create a PMN in the tumor-draining SLN. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of
preliminary data produced in the applicant’s laboratory; namely the discovery and characterization of
human lymphatic extracellular vesicles (L-EV) which have a demonstrated capacity to modulate
immune function. The rationale asserts that in elucidating the factors and signatures that define PMN
formation in the SLN, the knowledge gained will be significant as it will identify histopathologic biomarkers that
could aid in patient risk stratification beyond the presence of melanoma cells in the SLN. Guided by strong
preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) identify mechanisms whereby lymphatic
subcellular factors promote immune dysfunction in the pre-metastatic SLN beyond those already identified (i.e.
S100A9); 2) evaluate the prognostic utility of these immune-modulating factors in predicting risk of recurrence
by considering the comprehensive, interactive cellular landscape that defines the immunologically
compromised SLN. The approach is innovative as it will use a mechanism-driven model to identify subcellular
factors from a previously uncharacterized biological fluid, human lymph (Aim 1), complemented by a novel,
multiplexed biomarker imaging approach in order to survey the SLN immunological landscape in a quantitative
and spatially preserved manner to ultimately translate predictive features into clinically amenable platforms
(Aim 2). Such findings will result in a refined definition of early-stage patients at risk of relapse and in need of
earlier interventions."
10913346,"Abstract
Despite long-standing gender parity in the number of medical students, women remain underrepresented in the
senior ranks of the physician-scientist workforce, and research suggests that the mid-career transition is a
point at which many careers stall. Research is needed to identify effective, scalable interventions to promote
the careers of female physician-scientists throughout the career cycle, and particularly at the mid-career stage
when they are positioned to ascend to senior leadership. We previously generated actionable insights by
investigating the early career experiences of a national cohort of highly apt, research-oriented faculty members
with clinical doctorates: recipients of NIH K08 and K23 career development awards. This cohort has been
uniquely informative given its relative homogeneity in terms of high aptitude and motivation to pursue careers
as clinician-researchers and the resources initially invested in supporting their advancement to independence.
Ten years after our original study, we now propose to evaluate the impact of an intervention for women in this
national K-awardee cohort as its members enter mid-career, a time when individuals begin to gain resources
and influence in the form of endowed professorships, honorary society participation, and leadership positions.
Although there is strong evidence to suggest a need for an intervention to promote women’s careers in
biomedical research and some evidence to inform intervention design, we propose a brief period of
observational research to optimize the intervention for this particular mid-career cohort, who reached this
critical transition point just as the #metoo movement and potential backlash (including possible withholding of
sponsorship by senior men) developed. Therefore, in our first two aims, we propose survey and qualitative
methods to illuminate the mechanisms driving differences in career outcomes by gender in the post-#metoo
era and to explore the impact of the intersection of gender with other categories of disadvantage such as race
or sexual orientation, in order to inform the final design of our intervention. In our third aim, which is the primary
focus of the grant, we will implement and evaluate a peer mentorship intervention designed to mitigate the
differential challenges faced by women as they navigate the transition to senior leadership. We will compare
outcomes, including career advancement, productivity, and burnout among women randomized to either a
control arm provided with curricular materials or an intervention arm provided with the same materials but also
engaged in peer mentorship teams modeled on the Leadership Learning Model Framework developed for the
Executive Leadership in Academic Medicine Program, which is partnering with us in this work. This study will
be the first to test a readily scalable peer mentorship intervention that targets individuals at the critical mid-
career transition to senior leadership in biomedical research careers. Our prior research within this uniquely
informative cohort has yielded not only numerous influential publications but also inspired new policies and
programs, demonstrating the potential for this proposal to have broad impact."
10913462,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Membraneless organelles, or biomolecular condensates, have emerged as a strategy to organize the contents
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These phase separated compartments play key roles in a range of cellular
functions – from signaling to tuning metabolic pathways or controlling gene expression – yet there are still
questions about the fundamental mechanisms for their formation, dynamics, and function. The relationship
between condensate molecular properties and function is not yet understood, but this could provide an avenue
to treat diseases that involve dysregulated protein condensates (neurodegeneration, cataracts, cancer). Our
research proposes to develop functional synthetic biomolecular condensates in order to address several over-
arching questions: How do specific intermolecular interactions (electrostatic, cation-π, etc.) contribute to protein
phase transitions? How do protein sequence and structure influence the physical properties and function of the
condensed phase? Is there a connection between the materials properties and the function of biomolecular
condensates? Semi-synthetic biomolecular condensates will allow us to evaluate how molecular interactions in
the condensed phase contribute not only to the dynamics of the phase but also to small and macromolecule
partitioning, and ultimately the function of endogenous biomolecular condensates. The goals of the proposed
research program are to create enzymatically active synthetic membraneless organelles in vitro and in vivo. New
materials with varied chemical environments will be prepared and new methods for imaging protein condensates
at the molecular scale will be established. These advances will help us to understand how protein sequence
influences function at both the microscale (e.g. of an individual enzyme) and the mesoscale (e.g. of a condensed
phase cellular compartment). Engineering orthogonal biomolecular condensates has the potential to impact our
understanding of the function of native biomolecular condensates and provide a synthetic biology platform to
artificially regulate information flow in the cell."
10913593,"Project Summary
Fibrotic remodeling after myocardial infarction involves temporal development of several fibroblast phenotypes,
characterized by high proliferation rates, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and heightened extracellular matrix
deposition. These processes require large increases in metabolic demand to achieve or maintain the activated
fibroblast state. Nevertheless, how fibroblasts meet these phases of high metabolic demand and whether
particular metabolic steps could be antifibrotic targets remains unclear. Previous studies indicate that profibrotic
stimuli augment catabolic activity in fibroblasts and that lowering either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation
diminishes myofibroblast differentiation. These metabolic pathways are important not only for ATP production,
but also for their role in the synthesis of cellular building blocks and secreted proteins. In particular, several
glycolytic intermediates serve as amphibolic metabolites capable of entering into pathways responsible for de
novo nucleotide, phospholipid, and amino acid synthesis. These biosynthetic pathways could be particularly
important in the fibrotic response because activated fibroblasts require higher anabolic output to provide
biomolecular building blocks for cell division and ECM secretion. Our preliminary data suggest that the
gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 2 (Pck2), is upregulated in activated fibroblasts.
This enzyme is positioned to coordinate anabolic processes because it can deliver carbon from the Krebs cycle
intermediate pool to the 3-carbon glycolytic pool, thereby increasing precursors for several biosynthetic
pathways. We also find glutaminase to be upregulated in activated fibroblasts, which could augment glutamine-
derived carbon for the Krebs cycle pool, which is then available to Pck2. Suggestive of its importance to fibroblast
function, Pck2 deletion decreases fibroblast proliferation and appears to affect markers of myofibroblasts,
indicating that it is a critical enzyme that may facilitate or uphold the activated fibroblast phenotype. We propose
that Pck2 is a fundamental regulator of fibrosis that regulates fibroblast activation by meeting the biosynthetic
demands required for proliferation or ECM deposition. Nevertheless, virtually nothing is known about how
biosynthetic pathways change in fibroblasts in response to fibrogenic stimuli or how Pck2 influences fibroblast
metabolism and cardiac fibrosis. To address these gaps in knowledge, we will: (1) elucidate how Pck2 influences
cardiac fibroblast metabolism; and (2) determine the influence of Pck2 on fibroblast activation and MI-induced
cardiac remodeling. This project will yield fundamental knowledge necessary for understanding how fibroblast
metabolism modulates fibrotic remodeling after cardiac injury."

Training Program which is an interdisciplinary training program that seeks to provide research
and curricular-based training to a pool of talented and highly motivated students who seek training
in microbial pathogenesis and beneficial host-microbe interactions. The HMI program consists of
18 Training Faculty who have an average of $736,699 direct costs per year, and annual direct
costs for research total to $13.3 million. Trainers currently have 72 trainees in their labs. Areas of
strength among our Trainers include molecular genetics of bacterial, fungal, and viral
pathogenesis, and prion biology, study of the microbiome, interaction with immune and epithelial
cells, and ecological modeling. These areas are pursued using the full range of modern genetic,
molecular, biochemical, immunologic, and computational techniques. Trainees are supported by
one of three excellent multidisciplinary graduate programs, the Microbiology and Molecular
Pathogenesis program (M2P2), and the Guarini School of Graduate and Advanced Studies. We
have both hired new faculty whose research is directly aligned with the program goals, indicating
the institution’s commitment to research in microbiology and recruited to our program Dartmouth
faculty whose research in host-microbe interactions has expanded. Most importantly, our past
Trainees have been extremely successful. Of the 33 HMI Training Program Trainees who have
left Dartmouth in the past 15 years, 32 are in PhD-level careers in science and one is a high
school science teacher and thus is still leveraging their training. HMI Trainees from the past ten
years have published 83 papers. In the past four years since the last renewal, we have made
several positive changes to the program including 1) mentor training from the Center for the
Improvement of the Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER) with 94% of our Trainers having
already completed training, 2) increased the involvement of early career or new-to-Dartmouth
faculty in program subcommittees, 3) enhanced support for preparation of F31 applications, and
4) focus of a Trainee curriculum that is broadly useful across sub-disciplines within the area of
host-microbe interactions. To continue our positive impact on the biomedical workforce, we
request to continue supporting five trainees per year."
10938478,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder with ~5.4 million Americans
living with Alzheimer’s disease. Central to Alzheimer’s disease is the ongoing loss of neuronal plasticity which
impairs cognitive functions and eventually disrupts basic brain functions, resulting in death. Yet, we still lack
significant disease-modifying interventions for the disease. Thus, new approaches are needed to identify the
mechanisms involved in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Key clues come from evidence that exposures to
environmental neurotoxicants are causally linked to a higher incidence of Alzheimer’s disease. Moreover, there
are sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease with women more affected compared to men. Finally, one of the most
salient consequences of Alzheimer’s pathology is the loss of neuroplasticity and neurodegeneration, which
strongly correlates with memory loss as well as cognitive and motor decline. Together, these findings extend our
existing NIEHS-funded R01 (R01ES034037) whose focus is to investigate mechanisms by which the vesicular
glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) mediates selective vulnerability to neurodegeneration in males and females
caused by exposure to environmental toxicants including pesticides. To adapt the core concepts of our R01 to
Alzheimer’s disease, we established an experimental system where we can convert human fibroblasts from
Alzheimer’s disease patients and age-matched unaffected individuals directly into induced neurons (iNs). This
approach enables the iNs to retain the epigenetic and transcriptomic age signatures similar to those of the aging
human brain and has proven vital for modeling the pathology for age-related neurodegenerative disorders like
Alzheimer’s disease. Critically, we can generate several unique patient-derived iNs of sporadic and familial
Alzheimer’s disease from male and female patients, enabling us to recapitulate key aspects of human
Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology. In parallel, we developed new live-cell and cryo-electron tomography
approaches in primary neurons and iNs to study activity-driven local translation – a process that is central to
synaptic plasticity and which is lost in Alzheimer’s disease. In this supplement, we will take advantage of
innovative new tools and our team’s expertise in neurodegeneration to answer several fundamental questions:
1) whether pesticides exacerbate mitochondrial oxidative stress in Alzheimer’s disease patient neurons to
increase Alzheimer’s pathology (e.g., amyloid-b and tau accumulation) and accelerate cell loss; 2) if pesticide
exposures impact mitochondrial function and cell plasticity differently in male vs female Alzheimer’s iNs; and 3)
if modifying VGLUT2 expression alters pesticide-induced neurodegeneration in male vs female Alzheimer’s
patient iNs. We hypothesize pesticide-induced mitochondrial dysfunction initiate or exacerbate accumulation of
pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, culminating in less neural plasticity and neuron loss. Ultimately,
our proposed work will provide the basis for an Alzheimer’s-focused R01 grant and provide mechanisms by
which environmental neurotoxicants foster development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease pathology."
10938480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pediatric long-segment airway defects are caused by congenital malformations or result from trauma,
infection, or malignancy. Although rare, these defects are often fatal. There is currently no established surgical
technique to repair long-segment tracheal defects and the reconstructive options remain heroic. Tissue
engineering has the potential to replace failed tissue with a normal, living organ. Despite its potential, clinical
outcomes of tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETG) have been poor.
 The main barriers to translation of tracheal replacement are graft collapse and delayed epithelialization.
We assessed the performance of partially decellularized tracheal grafts (PDTG) in our mouse model of orthotopic
tracheal replacement. Using resorbable biomaterials to stabilize PDTG, we created a Composite Tracheal Graft
(CTG). We hypothesize the CTG can improve overall survival in long-segment tracheal replacement, attenuate
graft collapse, promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production and SAE differentiation.
 To test this hypothesis, we will first assess how CTG promotes ECM regeneration in the tracheal
cartilage. In our first aim, we will implant PDTG and CTG in a mouse model of tracheal replacement and quantify
ECM production and mechanical properties. Using a conditional knock-out of chondrocyte-mediated ECM
production, we will then assess the impact on graft chondrocytes on ECM production. In our second aim, we will
define how SAE differentiation is promoted by CTG. We hypothesize that modification of graft dimensions with
splinting reduces wall shear stress (WSS) resulting in improved epithelial differentiation. To test the effect of
WSS on SAE differentiation, we will implant PDTG and CTG of normal and small diameter, thus increasing WSS
by reducing graft radius. To quantify WSS, we will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to topographically
map WSS through the grafts and correlate these values with quantitative immunofluorescenceof neo-epithelium.
Finally, we will validate CTG performance in an ovine model of tracheal replacement in our third aim. Using
routine radiographic and endoscopic surveillance, we will quantify animal survival, clinical manifestations, graft
dimensions, and graft regeneration.
 This proposal advances the field of airway tissue engineering through the development of a composite
tissue engineered tracheal graft and defining the mechanical factors contributing to graft regeneration."

The Cardiovascular Sciences Training Program (CSTP) at the University of Chicago provides both pre-doctoral
and post-doctoral training. The postdoctoral trainees who participate in the CSTP include both M.D. and Ph.D.
trainees. The M.D. trainees are physician scientists most commonly recruited from the Cardiology Fellowship
Program at the University of Chicago, and the Ph.D. trainees have received their graduate degrees in diverse
areas and seek additional training in the cardiovascular sciences. The CSTP also supports pre-doctoral
training, an element essential to this integrated training program. The post-doctoral training strikes a balance
between clinically-trained M.D. fellows who plan careers combining research with clinical medicine, and
outstanding Ph.D. fellows who are dedicated to cardiovascular research. The CSTP offers training in six core
components:
1) Molecular Cardiology and Cell Signaling
2) Genetics/Genomics of the Cardiovascular System
3) Development, Stem Cell Biology & Regeneration
4) Cardiovascular Imaging and Translational Biology
5) Vascular Biology & Inflammation
6) Systems Biology and Bioinformatics
Each of these areas has as its scientific mission furthering our understanding of cardiovascular function in
health and disease. To this end, participants in this training program receive didactic, laboratory-based, ethics,
and analytic training in order to prepare for careers in cardiovascular research. We propose to continue
supporting 3 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees. The range of experience for the post-doctoral trainees
ranges from 0 to 6 years of post-doctoral training since M.D. fellows have often completed postgraduate
medical training at the time they begin in full time research in the CSTP. In the last training period, we
emphasized programs in genetic and genomics reflecting the growth in these fields and their successful
application to the cardiovascular sciences. We also enriched training opportunities in regenerative sciences
since important advances have been made for cardiac and vascular biology in this area. In this next interval,
we have additionally enlisted trainers with accomplishments in systems biology and analysis responding to
needs to take better advantage of emerging and existing “big data” and the expertise on the University of
Chicago campus. Systems analysis will be integrated with cardiac genetics and development and regeneration
biology, since these topics are critical to define the normal and abnormal function of the heart."
10936819,"Cancer patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (SCT) face numerous challenges because of this
treatment’s toxicity, lengthy hospitalization and recovery, and persistent medical and psychosocial stressors.
Patients describe needing more information and support to help them manage distress, medical symptoms, and
poor quality of life; feel prepared for SCT; and adhere to critical post-SCT preventive behaviors. Patient education
from healthcare providers is a critical information resource, but patients also describe wanting information from
other patients and needing types of information and emotional support that are best provided by people who
have undergone SCT (i.e., peer support) including realistic information about the experience of treatment and
recovery, side effects, and ways of coping. Peer support can reduce distress and social isolation; increase hope
and optimism; help patients feel more informed, empowered, and prepared; normalize their reactions and
experiences; alert them to available resources; support and inform decision making; and model new ways of
problem solving and coping. Research shows that cancer patients have limited access to peer support, which is
challenging to provide in a scalable, cost-effective way. In the prior project period for this award (R01CA223963),
we developed a website (called Mosaic) in both English and Spanish to deliver peer support to SCT recipients
through a collection of first-hand, survivor-written narratives paired with coordinated educational content and
stress/coping resources. Developed with extensive guidance from a community advisory board, focus groups,
usability testing, and a strong theoretical foundation, Mosaic was designed to be scalable, easily accessible, and
able to help patients understand a range of SCT experiences in a way that is tailored to their emotional and
problem-focused coping needs. Mosaic is now ready for efficacy testing. We propose a 2-arm randomized
controlled trial to evaluate whether providing patients with Mosaic prior to SCT can reduce their psychological
distress (primary outcome) and improve other patient-reported and clinical outcomes. We will randomize 356
English- and Spanish-speaking patients recruited pre-SCT to Mosaic or to a rigorous web-based enhanced usual
care condition that includes only Mosaic’s educational content. Participants will complete assessments at pre-
SCT baseline, and 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months post-SCT. The trial will allow us to achieve 3 aims: (1) establish
Mosaic’s efficacy for improving patient-reported outcomes of English and Spanish-speaking SCT patients; (2)
determine mechanisms driving Mosaic’s effect on patient-reported outcomes; and (3) examine moderators of
Mosaic’s effects on patient-reported outcomes. We will also use rich qualitative methods to explore patients’
experiences of whether and how Mosaic affected preventable clinical SCT outcomes with the goal of informing
more focused, rigorous future research on these mechanisms. If efficacious, Mosaic could be quickly
implemented clinically to reduce distress and improve outcomes in SCT."
10936899,"Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides in the world because they broadly target chewing and
sucking insects. Imidacloprid (IMI) is a common neonicotinoid that accounts for 30% of neonicotinoid sales
globally. IMI is used in commercial agricultural systems, sold for use in home gardens, and found in veterinary
pharmaceuticals in the form of flea and tick preventatives for companion animals. IMI is also used as crop
seed treatments and spreads throughout crops as they mature. Thus, IMI cannot be washed or peeled off
produce. As a result, humans are routinely exposed to IMI through consumption of contaminated food and
water as well as interactions with their pets. IMI kills insects by acting as a systemic neurotoxicant after
binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the nervous system. To date, exposure to IMI has not
been considered a public health concern because it is a weak agonist for mammalian nAChRs compared to
insect nAChRs. However, our preliminary data indicate that the ovary bioactivates IMI to desnitro-imidacloprid
(DNI). This is of concern because DNI has a higher affinity for nAChRs than IMI. Further, our preliminary
data indicate that the ovary contains nAChRs and that DNI is toxic to antral follicles. Specifically, DNI
exposure causes slow antral follicle growth, decreased estradiol production, follicle rupture, and increased
expression of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax in mouse antral follicles in vitro. Slow follicle growth, increased
Bax, follicle rupture, and low estradiol levels are of concern because they can lead to subfertility/infertility.
Although IMI exposure leads to production of DNI by ovarian follicles, DNI is an ovarian toxicant in vitro, and
ovarian toxicants often cause subfertility/infertility, we do not know if IMI exposure causes ovarian toxicity and
female subfertility/infertility in vivo. Thus, the goal of the proposed R21 studies is to expand our preliminary
data using a mouse model to test the hypothesis that IMI exposure leads to molecular changes in the ovary
to cause ovarian toxicity, leading to female subfertility/infertility. To test his hypothesis, we will: 1) determine
the extent to which IMI causes ovarian toxicity and female subfertility/infertility in vivo and 2) identify IMI-
induced changes in molecular factors in the ovary using spatial transcriptomics. Collectively, the proposed
R21 studies will determine whether IMI poses a female reproductive health hazard in mammals and should
be considered for regulation of use in adult women."

Pathogenic variants in ACTA1, which encodes skeletal muscle-specific α-actin (SKA), cause a
range of congenital myopathies; at the severe end of the disease spectrum are patients
diagnosed with nemaline myopathy with intranuclear rods, or intranuclear rod myopathy.
Intranuclear rod myopathy is characterized by the formation of SKA-containing rod-like
structures within the nucleus of myocytes, and is associated with infantile-onset muscle
weakness and death in early childhood due to respiratory failure, for which there are no current
targeted therapies. Recurrent variants affecting Val163 in SKA are associated with intranuclear
rod formation, but the pathogenic mechanisms driving the severity of disease in these patients
are unknown. We were the first to show that the smooth muscle-specific α-actin has a critical
function in the nucleus: loss of nuclear smooth muscle-specific α-actin prevents complete
differentiation of smooth muscle cells. Muscle biopsies from patients with intranuclear rod
myopathy show immature muscle fibers and increased numbers of progenitor-like satellite cells,
suggesting that incomplete differentiation of skeletal myocytes may be a pathologic feature of
this disease. We therefore hypothesize that SKA functions in the nucleus to promote skeletal
myocyte differentiation and that disruption of the nuclear functions of SKA in patients with
intranuclear rods causes incomplete skeletal myocyte differentiation, which underlies the severe
and early-onset disease. We will test our hypothesis by the following specific aims: 1) In the
C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line, we will identify intranuclear localization, protein binding
partners, and target genomic loci for nuclear SKA with and without p.Val163 variants. 2) We will
assess whether the intranuclear rod-associated p.Val163Leu variant prevents complete
differentiation in vitro using a model of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)
differentiation to skeletal myocytes. We will differentiate Crispr/Cas9-edited ACTA1 p.Val163Leu
iPSCs alongside isogenic controls. 3) We will generate a conditional knock-in mouse model for
the Acta1 p.Val163Leu variant and induce knock-in in skeletal myocytes either during
development with a constitutive Acta1-Cre or after development with an inducible Acta1-
MerCreMer. We will assess whether introduction of the variant during development results in a
more severe phenotype of incompletely differentiated muscle. Taken together, these data will
identify a novel role for SKA in the nucleus during healthy skeletal myocyte development and
will identify a key pathogenic mechanism for intranuclear rod myopathy. Identifying a disease
mechanism may lead to development of therapeutic strategies for these patients."

peroxides that results in oxidative damage and plasma membrane disruption. Ferroptosis is a form of cell death
that is mechanistically and morphologically distinct from other forms of cell death, such as necroptosis, apoptosis,
and pyroptosis. Targeting ferroptosis has garnered immense interest in the cancer research community owing
to the potential to selectively active this mechanism of cell death in cancer cells. To realize the full potential of
inducing ferroptosis in cancer, non-invasive imaging markers are needed.
System xc-, the cystine-glutamate antiporter, is a plasma membrane transporter mediating the cellular uptake of
cystine in exchange for intracellular glutamate. System xc- plays a critical role in ferroptosis by regulating the
availability of cystine, a crucial precursor for glutathione biosynthesis, thus impacting the cellular antioxidant
defense system and ultimately influencing susceptibility to ferroptosis. Modulation of system xc- activity with
pharmacological inhibitors is a potential therapeutic strategy that regulates this form of cell death in anti-cancer
therapy. Molecular imaging of system xc- therefore has the potential to identify cancers with appropriate
transporter activity that would be suitable for ferroptosis induction, assess drug engagement and inhibition of
system xc- in living subjects, and monitor the efficacy of targeting this emerging mechanism of cell death in
cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the investigation of system xc- radiopharmaceuticals in this context of
ferroptosis, has yet to be reported.
We have pioneered the development of [18F]hGTS13, a homo-glutamate radiotracer specific for system xc-.
Importantly, [18F]hGTS13 demonstrates several advantages over existing system xc- radiotracers including: 1)
incorporation of a UV-active group, thus greatly facilitating radiosynthesis and quality control; 2) improved
transporter specificity; and 3) reduced uptake in multiple immune cell types and improved cancer specificity. The
goals of this proposal are to establish [18F]hGTS13 PET as a non-invasive imaging marker of drug induced
cancer ferroptosis in cell culture and pre-clinical models and to clinically translate [18F]hGTS13 by determining
its pharmacokinetics in healthy human volunteers through an exploratory investigational new drug mechanism.
We will first establish the relationship between [18F]hGTS13 uptake and sensitivity to cancer ferroptosis in the in
vitro and in vivo setting (SA1). We will then test the ability of [18F]hGTS13 to monitor the engagement of pro-
ferroptotic drugs in vivo and predict treatment response (SA2). Lastly, we will translate [18F]hGTS13 for first-in-
human testing and determine its biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in healthy volunteers (SA3).
Successful completion of this project will establish the foundation for employing [18F]hGTS13 to select patients
that are likely to be sensitive to ferroptosis inducing therapies and monitor treatment effects. The findings from
this work will have high impact as inducers of ferroptosis advance to clinical investigation."

The brain must maintain immunological homeostasis to prevent dysregulation and disease. Coordination of
immunity in most tissues involves the drainage of antigens or antigen-presenting cells within conventional
lymphatic vessels to the draining lymph nodes. In the lymph node, antigen presented to T cells, typically by
dendritic cells (DCs), can initiate an immune response. Control of immune response is unique in the central
nervous system as the brain parenchyma lacks conventional infiltrating lymphatic vessels and instead utilizes a
combination of intra-tissue glial-dependent clearance pathways and meningeal lymphatics surrounding the brain
to drain waste, antigens, fluid, and cells. Recently there has been mounting evidence implicating meningeal
lymphatic vessels as passive conductors of drainage in the progression, and resolution of various
neuropathologies. We previously discovered that neuroinflammation induces lymphangiogenesis of the
meningeal lymphatic vessels at the cribriform plate (cp) (Hsu et al. Nat Comm. 2019). We found that in situ
meningeal lymphangiogenesis was driven by VEGF-C producing DCs, and this is unique to the cp, highlighting
potentially different roles for dural lymphatics in neuroinflammation depending on their precise location. Here we
show single-cell RNA sequencing data revealing that neuroinflammation induces cribriform plate lymphatic
endothelial cell (cpLECs) gene expression related to antigen presentation, leukocyte adhesion, and
immunoregulation. This indicates that cpLECs are not just passive conductors of drainage, but active
contributors to the formation of a neuroimmune regulatory niche. We hypothesize that during neuroinflammation,
the cribriform lymphatics represent an immunoregulatory niche in which migratory DCs drained from the brain
are retained and communicate with cpLECs to regulate downstream immune response and homeostasis of the
central nervous system. The pathways of DCs traffic through the brain to the cribriform lymphatics, the
mechanism of their interaction with cpLECs, and the functional consequence of these interactions on both cell
types and on the formation of a neuroimmune niche are not known.
The long-term objective of this project is to define the pathways and dynamics of interactions between dendritic
cells and the cribriform plate lymphatics to understand the regulation of brain homeostasis and disease. The
specific objectives of this proposal are to map the timeline, origin, and mechanism of dendritic cell - cribriform
lymphatic endothelial cells interaction (DC-cpLEC) in the meningeal lymphatic vessels at the cribriform plate
(Aim 1); to define expressional consequences of the interaction between DCs and cpLECs (Aim 2), and to
examine the impact of DC-cpLEC interactions on lymphatic functionality and immunity (Aim 3).
Pharmacological manipulation of the cross-talk between dendritic cells and cribriform lymphatic endothelial cells
in CNS diseases may have potential therapeutic value for diseases related to CNS autoimmunity and
homeostasis."
10933770,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescent cells were hypothesized to contribute to development of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) by secreting inflammatory factors in their surrounding microenvironments. However,
the exact role of senescent neurons in brain aging and effective ways to mitigate their contribution to
ADRD development are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we need high-resolution spatial
omics data, which covers hundreds of genes and potentially have the information on how a cell impacts its
microenvironment.
In this study, the Orr Lab generates spatial omics data from ADRD brains and the corresponding mouse
models. The Zare Lab uses deep learning and other machine learning techniques to fully leverage the
spatial aspects of these data. In the R21 phase, we identify molecular changes in the microenvironment of
senescent neurons compared to healthy neurons. In Aim 1, we identify the general molecular markers of
senescent neurons while Aim 2 is focused on their role specifically in neuronal death in brain aging and
ADRD.
The rationale for this study is the accumulating evidence by our team, and others, that demonstrate a
mechanistic link between cellular senescence and ADRD. Specifically, a) in a seminal study, the Orr Lab
identified senescent neurons in human Alzheimer’s disease that were mechanistically linked to
neurodegeneration using tau transgenic mice, b) by analyzing transcriptome data of 140K single nuclei
derived from 76 human brains with various levels of ADRD pathology, the Zare Lab identified cyclin-
dependent kinase inhibitor 2D (CDKN2D/p19) as a marker for senescent neurons. Using p19 and other
markers, we showed that senescent neurons have a significant overlap with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT)
pathology in the human brain, and c) we have recently discovered that Fas receptor (CD95), which
induces apoptosis, is overexpressed in the microenvironment of senescent neurons in ADRD brains
compared to normal brains.
 The R33 phase has a mechanistic approach aiming at limiting negative effects of neural senescence on
brain aging. In Aim 3, the Zare Lab uses deep models to simulate deregulation of a particular gene in
senescent neurons to predict its effects on other genes in the microenvironment. In Aim 4, we use a
similar approach to determine the most promising treatment that can possibly mitigate the negative effects
of neural senescence. The Orr Lab determines their mechanistic role in pathogenesis using mouse
models for ADRD.
The expected outcomes of this study includes the discovery of negative senescence effects in brain aging
and possible novel treatments for ADRD that mitigate these effects."

Endemic and emerging zoonoses both represent profound threats to public health. While these two disease
systems diverge in many ways, fundamental to both is the importance contact networks in which humans and
animals mix. In STI research and veterinary epidemiology, analysis of human-only and livestock-only networks
have led to significant insights on how transmission occurs, and how best to interrupt it. Yet to our knowledge,
no prior research has modeled a human-animal contact network using empirical data, leaving the benefits of
network epidemiology inaccessible to zoonotic disease research and control. As a result, researchers must as-
sume that humans and animals mix randomly, or rely on weakly-justified assumptions about stratified risk, when
building mathematical models, designing surveillance systems, or planning interventions. There is a critical need
to characterize the structure and dynamics of human-animal contact across a range of settings and disease
systems, in order to reduce the burden of endemic zoonoses and prevent emergence of novel zoonoses. Our
long-term goal is to develop a suite of methods for conducing human-animal network analyses. Our overall
objective is to demonstrate proof-of-principle: that analysis of human-animal contact networks is feasible, and
results in improved inference. Because emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens is a rare event, we will instead
use data from four high-burden endemic zoonoses representing a range of transmission modes: brucellosis, Q
fever, leptospirosis, and anaplasmosis. This ensures we will have adequate power to achieve our objective, and
contributes to the control of high-morbidity, poverty-reinforcing diseases. Across Dornod and Uvurkhangai prov-
inces in Mongolia, we will use an egocentric approach to sampling whereby ego households are randomly se-
lected and asked to name alter households: those whose animal herd mixes with their own. In Aim 1, following
formative qualitative research we will collect empirical human-livestock contact data using surveys and livestock
GPS collars. GPS collars will be placed for five months, during which period network changes will be captured
using a monthly husbandry log (household) and a 24 hour contact diary (individual) completed once per month.
In Aim 2 we will fit a generative network model to the network data gathered in Aim 1. We will simulate synthetic
networks from this generative model, and demonstrate their validity using disease data from real-time qPCR
testing and molecular strain typing. Finally, in Aim 3 we will combine these synthetic networks and disease data
in an epidemic model of disease transmission, separately for each disease, broadly following an SEIR frame-
work. Using these models, we will evaluate the added utility gained by incorporating network structure compared
with assuming random mixing. We expect our contribution to be methods for measuring and modeling human-
animal contact networks. These will provide the necessary foundation for conducting human-animal network
analyses across a range of settings, allowing benefits to accrue through improving the validity of zoonotic disease
modeling and generating broad insights on human-animal network structure."

In many cognitive processes, information is processed in a parallel manner across many brain regions. This is
thought to make our cognitive abilities highly tolerant to perturbations or neuron-loss because disrupted
processes are compensated by other redundant neurons coding the same information. Yet, it remains poorly
understood how interconnected networks of neurons are organized into redundant representations to produce
robustness. We recently discovered that persistent activity in mouse frontal cortex during short-term memory is
remarkably robust to perturbations. The two hemispheres of cortex are organized into redundant modules where
each one can independently maintain persistent activity. When one suffers a perturbation, signals from the other
hemisphere help restore the activity. Modularity and redundancy may be a general organizing principle of
information processing and storage in cortical circuits. Understanding the neurobiology of this novel and
potentially fundamental organizing principle will have deep implications for design of neural manipulation
strategies and understanding behavioral manifestation of chronic neurodegeneration. In the proposed research,
we will establish and validate a novel framework that combines computational modeling, population recording,
and targeted optogenetic perturbations to identify, probe, and chronically track modular organization of cortical
circuits. Our goal is to dissect redundant modular organizations within and across brain areas, obtain a deeper
understanding of how multiple redundant modules coordinate information to support robust behavior, and how
such modular organization is shaped by learning to manifests in robust behavior."

10936791,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While one of the most remarkable features of the human species is our capacity for extreme longevity,
understanding the marked variation in life spans within and between populations and the capacity for further
life span extension are key priorities for aging research. A key insight from research thus far is that early life
has an especially important influence on life span differences both within humans and between humans and
other species.
Given its profound negative impacts on morbidity and mortality risk over the life course, early life
adversity is an important source of heterogeneity that also shapes disparities in human health and life span.
The widespread nature of these effects in humans and other animals suggests that the mechanisms that
underlie them have deep evolutionary roots, making comparative models appropriate and useful for assessing
responses to early life adversity across many ecological and social conditions. This study investigates two of
humans’ closest living relatives, chimpanzees and gorillas, to determine how variation in the prevalence of and
resilience to early life adversity shapes the capacity to achieve long life span in diverse environments. To aid in
distinguishing species differences from differences due to local ecologies, we include 2 populations of
chimpanzees. The three study systems differ in life span and occupy markedly different ecological and social
systems, exposing them to different regimes of adversity. This is a mixed prospective and longitudinal study,
leveraging 170 years of detailed demographic and early life adversity data from approximately 400 wild
chimpanzees and 485 wild gorillas. Aim 1 will determine the causes, severity, and responses to early life
adversity within populations, and between sexes, to quantify its influence on individual risk of mortality and
frailty. To accomplish this, we will analyze detailed demographic data and systematic quantitative measures of
social and ecological adversities, while generating novel and harmonizable measures of the biological effects
of these adversities for both developing and adult individuals. Aim 2 will use these data to determine how
different frequency of and sensitivity to adversity shapes heterogeneity in adult cohorts, and in turn influences
variation in demographic aging and life span. We will also perform structured comparative models and
simulations to evaluate the effects of early life adversity on population and species differences in longevity-
influencing life history traits. This project is made possible by three exceptionally rich longitudinal datasets from
wild apes, incorporating extensive biological sampling and health monitoring. The project will generate new
information that addresses key priorities for research on human life span, including the gender morbidity-
mortality paradox, determinants of social gradients in health span and life span, and identifying promising
targets for interventions to enhance human health span and life span."
11077507,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a leading cause of liver-related mortality/morbidity, and there is no
FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD. Advanced ALD conditions, including severe alcohol-associated
hepatitis (sAH) and decompensated alcohol-associated cirrhosis (deAC), have especially poor outcomes.
Indeed, the 90-day mortality for sAH is ~30%. Return to drinking impacts quality of life and mortality in these
patients. There are limited drug therapies or well-studied behavior therapies in this patient population. An optimal
approach would be the integration of AUD and ASLD care givers and therapies, but there are no guidelines for
this approach. Our proposed AUD/ALD team approach seeks to overcome the perceived stigma of alcohol
misuse which can adversely affect treatment seeking, quality of care and patient outcomes. The AlcHepNet study
was stopped at the interim analysis because of the unexpected 90% 90-day survival in sAH patients treated with
prednisone using the Lille stopping rule. These dramatic results need to be confirmed, and novel therapies such
as IL-22 need to be studied in sAH. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) improved MELD score
at 30 days and reduced drinking at 6 months in patients with moderate AH (e.g., novel AUD/ALD therapy).
Acamprosate appears to be the safest FDA-approved therapy for AUD in patients with ALD, but safety and
efficacy in severe ALD need to be evaluated. Take Control is a novel computer-based behavioral platform derived
from the NIAAA’s Rethinking Drinking which we propose to evaluate in severe ALD. Based on preliminary data
and knowledge gaps, our overall hypothesis is that an integrated management of ALD and AUD will
improve clinical outcomes in patients with sAH and decompensated ALD. We will utilize the following AIMS:
Aim 1. Perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial of treatment for steroid-eligible patients with
severe AH. A masked study comparing daily prednisone for 28 days (with the 7-day Lille score-based stop rule)
vs. IL-22 fusion protein (F-652). Early intervention for AUD will include behavioral therapy platform (Take Control)
in all subjects and either acamprosate or placebo before discharge from the hospital. The primary endpoint of
the trial will be a composite measure of mortality, liver, and alcohol use related outcomes.
Aim 2. Evaluate Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) in patients with decompensated ALD cirrhosis. In
patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to ALD, in whom corticosteroids are not effective, a randomized,
placebo-controlled trial of LGG in combination with Take Control and locally accepted SOC for 6 months will be
performed. A composite measure (as in AIM 1) at 6 months will be the primary end point for this AIM also.
AIM 3. Build a platform for biosamples, data repositories, and patient registries to support site-specific
and network-wide ancillary studies.
In summary, these proposed studies will leverage the existing resources of the AlcHepNet to evaluate the clinical
impact of integrated ALD/AUD treatment in a diverse cohort of typically underserved patients."

Aging causes cellular damage that leads to functional decline, chronic diseases, and ultimately mortality. Stem
cell functional impairment or loss is a significant effect of aging. To counter the effects of aging, intervention
strategies are being developed to refocus efforts on extending/enhancing the healthspan, i.e., the period of life
prior to the onset of chronic disease and disabilities of aging by maintaining good health. Endurance exercise
has long been held as an important lifestyle intervention to boost healthspan. However, the ability of chronic
exercise adaptations to affect signaling pathways that impinge on stem cell functions is unclear. Two key stem
cell populations—somatic intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and germline testis stem cells (GSCs)—serve as ideal
model cell types in Drosophila to determine the impact of exercise adaptations on the aging stem cell. Despite
their key similarities and differences in functional dynamics, both stem cell populations respond strongly to
JAK-STAT signaling, which, with aging, produces paradoxical effects on each population. In the ISCs, aging
increases JAK-STAT signaling and leads to a hyperproliferative phenotype resulting in gut dysplasia and
decreased healthspan. In the GSCs, however, aging leads to JAK-STAT hypoactivation and results in reduced
stem cell number and functional decline. Hence, aging perturbs the functional equilibrium for stem cell JAK-
STAT signaling. Using a Drosophila model of endurance exercise training, this project investigates the capacity
of exercise adaptations to ameliorate or even significantly prevent the deterioration of JAK-STAT signaling
dynamics in ISCs and GSCs, thus, furthering the healthspan of aging animals. Genetic approaches are
combined with morphometric imaging to determine the impact of exercise on aging ISCs and GSCs.
Furthermore, cell biological approaches complement unbiased, whole genome approaches—ChIP-Seq and
single cell transcriptomic profiling—to determine whether exercise adaptations can reset the gene expression
profiles and prolong normal functions in the aging stem cell. Together, these approaches are likely to uncover
results that are expected to enhance the understanding of fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms
driving the impact of exercise on stem cell aging. These findings will have important implications for
translational approaches directed at investigating lifestyle intervention strategies to prevent aging-induced stem
cell malfunction."

Indirect calorimetry (IC) is based on measurement of the exchange of respiratory gases. All aerobic energy-
releasing reactions in the body use oxygen; oxygen consumption, V.O2, is proportional to energy expenditure
(EE). Research-grade IC systems measure V.O2, carbon dioxide production, V.CO2, and minute ventilation, V.E,
breath by breath and then average results over multiple breaths to obtain accurate measures of cardiorespira-
tory function. Subjects' V.O2max (i.e., maximum attainable V.O2) is the gold standard for assessing cardiorespiratory
ﬁtness (CRF). Indirect calorimetry is a part of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), providing a comprehen-
sive assessment of physiology at rest and during stress. Further, derived variables (e.g., V.E=V.CO2, V.E=V.O2) have
signiﬁcant prognostic implications. For example, V.E=V.CO2 and V.E=V.O2, which can be obtained under maximal
and submaximal conditions, provide measures of ventilatory efﬁciency; higher ratios indicate reduced breathing
efﬁciency (e.g., due to pulmonary shunting or increased dead space ventilation). Like V.O2peak (i.e., the maximum
V.O2 attained by a patient in an exercise stress test), V.E=V.CO2 and V.E=V.O2 improve with treatment/training.
 In cardiac rehabilitation (CR), for example, patients with coronary artery disease or chronic heart failure
undergo supervised exercise training to improve heart health. Most CR is performed in outpatient settings,
where the lack of equipment and specially-trained staff have precluded quantitative measurement of key values.
To obtain such measures, patients have to be scheduled for CPET, which is expensive and generally not covered
by insurance after an initial test. In practice, due to the nonavailability of V.O2peak and other derived measures
in outpatient settings, suboptimal, semi-quantitative substitute measures are generally employed (e.g., 6-minute
walk test). The Mobile Metabolic Measurement (M3) system will enable this limitation to be overcome, enabling
objectively-measured V.O2, V.CO2, and V.E values to be available to provide CR patients with their initial exercise
intensities, to track their progress, and to optimize their exercise prescriptions to maximize safe progress. The
M3 system represents a substantial and practicable advance in quantitative CR patient monitoring.
Phase I Results All Phase I objectives were successfully achieved. Speciﬁcally, the statistical equivalence of
the M3 system's V.O2, V.CO2, and V.E measurements was demonstrated vis-à-vis two criterion systems: (1) the
VacuMed Metabolic Simulator with Mass Flow Controller system [158]; and (2) the Oxycon Mobile system [49].
Phase II Goal Phase II will involve: (1) developing and validating the M3 system product using the VacuMed
Metabolic Simulator, including the clinical software that will run on tablets and other computers; (2) evaluating
M3 system performance in healthy adults; and (3) evaluating M3 system performance in patients with chronic
stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Rigorous comparisons with commercial IC systems (viz., Oxycon Mobile
and Vyntus CPX metabolic cart) will be made during aerobic exercise. Performance testing will be conducted in
collaboration with the Arizona State University (healthy subjects) and the University of Virginia (CAD patients)."
10921133,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are rare inherited metabolic disorders caused by defects in the cellular
catabolic system. Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIC (MPS IIIC or Sanfilippo disease type C) is one such LSD
that is caused by deficiency of the enzyme heparan sulfate acetyl CoA: -glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase,
(HGSNAT) essential for degradation of heparan sulfate, a repeating carbohydrate generally found attached to
proteoglycans. This disease causes accumulation of heparan sulfate resulting in a progressive and severe
neurological deterioration early in life with little somatic features. The symptoms in patients with MPS IIIC may
present at an average age of 3.5 years of age with psychomotor developmental delays and behavioral problems.
Before the age of 15 years verbal communication is often lost in patients with MPS IIIC. Most lose the ability to
walk between the 20 and 30 years of age. The condition is fatal by an average age of 34 years (range, 25-48).
Enzyme replacement therapies are not an option since the protein is localized and bound to lysosomal
membrane. There are currently no treatments available for treatment of MPS IIIC. Individuals affected by
MPS IIIC are managed with supportive care, consultation with medical professionals from multiple disciplines,
physical therapy, and pharmacological interventions to alleviate symptoms. Gene therapy represents a
reasonable and promising approach to provide a meaningful and long-term therapeutic benefit for this population
in the near future.
We had a positive interaction with the FDA and got guidance for moving our program into the clinics. In
preparation for the interventional study the recommendation was for a thorough natural history study (NHS) in
the available patient population with a broad net to capture endpoints that are most likely to predict the clinical
benefits in individuals. Since the number of diagnosed patients is small, individuals could potentially serve as
their own control at the time of intervention, where the patient will receive the gene therapy. Most of the work will
be executed by contracted service providers. The clinical trial itself will be conducted at UT Southwestern Medical
Center, Dallas, TX. The clinical protocol was designed by the team at Phoenix Nest with help of KOLs and clinical
experts in the MPS III field. We have engaged expert third party clinical service providers to help with the
execution, monitoring and data collection. Crucial data collected from the patients on this study will help us
develop clinical outcomes that will be tools for measuring the efficacy of our AAV9 gene therapy. This trial will
put a step closer to executing the pivotal trial to assess the efficacy of our experimental therapy and its
commercialization."
10934268,"BIOSPECIMEN AND BIOMARKER CORE: PROJECT ABSTRACT
The Biospecimen and Biomarker (BB) Core, Core B, will provide outstanding leadership and expertise in
biospecimen sciences and molecular analyses needed in this P01 to investigate the evolution of two of the most
common brain tumors, glioblastoma and meningioma. High-quality, well-annotated biospecimens and rigorous
and standardized analysis of tumor tissue are essential for testing the hypotheses associated with the scientific
Projects. The Core will acquire, annotate, distribute, track, and analyze brain tumor patient biospecimens from
the operating room. This will include the acquisition and analysis of image-guided regional and multiple spatially
distinct samples from patients with newly-diagnosed and recurrent meningioma and GBM. In addition, the Core
will provide histopathologic and molecular analysis of both human tumors and human tumor xenografts. The
overall goal of the Core is to improve the outcomes of patients with glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, (GBM) and
meningioma by working with the four research Projects and three other Cores to acquire high-quality, well-
annotated biospecimens and apply routine and advanced analytic methods that describe tumor heterogeneity.
Specific Aims of P01 Biospecimen and Biomarker Core:
Aim 1. To provide the staff and expertise for the acquisition and optimal preservation of high-quality
biospecimens, including whole tumor sampling, and their 3D spatial coordinates from the operating room.
Aim 2. To provide standardized routine and advanced tissue handling/processing and analytical techniques,
including multiplex immunoprofiling, multiplexed protein and RNA assays, and quantitative whole slide image
analysis that will allow each Project to fulfill its goals.
Aim 3. To provide biospecimen and neuropathology expertise to ensure optimal biospecimen quality and
extraction of high-quality, quantitative data from biospecimens collected from the operating room and animal
models.
Aim 4. To provide consistent oversight of the Core activities that will ensure the stringent compliance with
regulations governing informed consent and patient confidentiality, as well as management of the biospecimens
and the information derived from the biospecimens. This will include maintaining a tissue inventory and database
of associated molecular parameters that is linked to the Brain Tumor Center Database, integrating imaging,
clinical, molecular, and pathology data.
Impact: Well annotated clinical, imaging, histopathological and genomic data will be generated through close
collaboration with the Projects, ITHM, and ACS to advance our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and to
provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma and meningioma."
10931205,"ABSTRACT
Non-invasive recordings of human brain activity – be it of BOLD or neural field potentials – all share a common,
insurmountable weakness: it is impossible to identify whether amplitude changes to these signals are due to the
excitation or inhibition of their neural generators (i.e., the underlying patches of cortex). Hence, there is a critical
need to develop non-invasive measures of the moment-to-moment physiological excitability of the human cortex.
 Such a method exists for primary motor cortex. The TMS-induced motor evoked potential (MEP) in the
electromyogram indexes the physiological excitability of cortico-motor tracts originating in primary motor cortex
(M1). The MEP increases alongside motor-neuron firing during movement preparation and decreases alongside
reductions in M1 firing during movement cancellation. Here, we aim to test whether a signal with similar
properties can be derived outside of M1. Specifically, we aim to test whether the TMS-evoked potential (TEP)
in EEG recordings from human cortex similarly reflects changes in the cortical excitability of that underlying
cortex evoked by cognitive processes. The TEP is an EEG amplitude deflection that occurs after single pulses
of TMS applied anywhere on the brain.
 We will use a cognitive task to differentially induce the excitation and inhibition of the same cortical region
outside of M1: the frontal eye fields (FEF). The firing rate of FEF neurons is known to increase during memory-
guided saccades and decrease during the anticipation of anti-saccades (while notably, non-invasive BOLD
recordings show signaling increases in both conditions). We will perform an MRI-guided, sham-controlled
investigation of combined EEG and TMS to test whether the TEP – unlike fMRI or EEG – faithfully indexes these
changes in task-related neuronal firing. If so, this work would provide fundamentally novel, original method to
non-invasively measure the excitability and inhibition of cortical areas outside of M1."
10937834,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rising expense associated with stability and delivery are significant obstacles for using therapeutic proteins to
treat diseases. To resolve these issues, we propose to have the system that is making the therapeutic protein
also be the direct delivery system. Delivering proteins directly from an expression system to a target tissue has
the advantage of bypassing purification and eliminating stability issues during storage. Improvements to protein
expression and secretion in Pichia pastoris make this yeast a prime candidate for this purpose. We have
previously reported on P. pastoris’s ability to grow with cultured mammalian cells and secrete basic fibroblast
growth factor to influence fibroblast growth. We have since tested P. pastoris’s ability to live in the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract of C57BL/6J mice. The preliminary results showed that P. pastoris DNA was detectible in the murine
feces 24 hours after the last treatment, while green fluorescent protein secreted by this strain of P. pastoris was
detectible 72 hours after the last treatment. The fecal samples from P. pastoris-treated mice yielded no
measurable levels of calprotectin, a biomarker of inflammation. Histological analysis of the small intestine,
cecum, and colon showed no obvious signs of inflammation while enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis
of the GI tissues detected no increase in tumor necrosis factor alpha or interferon gamma. Furthermore, P.
pastoris-treated mice gained similar weight to control mice and exhibited no noticeable change in behavior. In
continuing with studies in animals, the goals of this proposal are to extend the duration of which P. pastoris can
remain in the murine gut and to provide proof of concept that P. pastoris is capable of surviving and delivering
recombinant proteins in the GI tract. Specific Aim 1 will determine if increasing dose and duration of treatment
will allow P. pastoris to remain in the gut for a longer time. To further enhance P. pastoris survival, we will
engineer a new strain of P. pastoris that will have affinity to mucin, an abundant protein in the mucus layer which
lines the entire GI tract. The effects of these treatment strategies on the inflammatory response in the murine
gut will also be assessed. In Specific Aim 2, we will use a hyper-lactose fed mouse model to determine if P.
pastoris can secrete recombinant proteins into the gut. A diet of 70% lactose causes adult mice to lose weight
due to an inability to digest lactose. Since lactase hydrolyzes lactose, a b-galactosidase (lactase)- secreting P.
pastoris strain that lives in the GI tract would be expected to enhance lactose digestion. Prevention of weight
loss in hyper-lactose fed mice would indicate that P. pastoris is secreting active lactase, suggesting that the
yeast has potential of secreting other heterologous proteins in the gut of mice as well. These studies establish a
foundational basis, upon which proteins made by P. pastoris can be directly administered to the GI tract of
animals as therapeutic agents for treating diseases."

The foundation of the Kim Research Group at Temple University is built upon the development of new designer
reagents and methods to access high-value carbonyl compounds from acetal-based radical precursors. To that
end, this proposal strives to implement acetal radicals as a means to access a diverse array of medicinally
relevant molecular platforms. To address these challenges, we have designed a set of novel reagents to
overcome rapid decarbonylation side reactions of acyl radicals and developed a platform to synthesize carbonyl
compounds of interest to those in the agrochemical, pharmaceutical, and material industries. Additionally, our
fundamental research in acetal radicals has provided alternative opportunities to study them in fragment coupling
reactions. This work will aid in the rapid construction of molecular complexity by combining C–H activation with
C–C bond formations to construct a wide variety of molecular scaffolds. This research is well poised to tackle
necessary synthetic challenges in order to build pharmaceutically relevant precursors, allowing it to be widely
adopted within the synthetic medicinal community. We have devised two research programs to address these
research aims. Research Program I will explore the use of acetal radicals to install high-value ketones that can
serve as carboxylic acid bioisosteres. Research Program II will explore alternative C–C couplings of acetal
radicals to install highly oxidized carbon fragments for complex molecular syntheses. This research will be
essential in shaping the next generation of design principles for improved pharmaceuticals to tackle human
diseases more effectively."

The T35 short term research training program at The University of Michigan Medical School,
now in its 37th year, introduces medical students to the concepts of medical research to spawn
the next generation of physician scientists. While the program was previously run in a
summer session between first and second year, a new medical school curriculum has moved
elective research time to the third year. This application proposes to move the T35 supported
training period to this point in the curriculum. The third year medical students entering the
program will have completed preliminary basic science and clinical training and be in an
excellent position to capitalize on this research opportunity. The students will undertake basic,
translational, or clinical research projects under the supervision of 103 faculty preceptors
representing 21 basic science and clinical disciplines. Despite the change in the schedule the
goals of our short term research program are unchanged: (1) Provide students with the
opportunity to learn research concepts and methodologies from active investigators, and
assess their desire to pursue careers in research; (2) Expand the scholarly and research
experiences of medical students as part of an overall career development strategy aimed at
increasing the number of talented students choosing careers as physician scientists; (3)
Promote high quality and intensive research opportunities for those students who are already
on a path toward academic medicine; (4) Provide students who elect not to go into academic
medicine an understanding of the scientific method and critical analysis of literature through
their research experience; (5) Increase the number of students from diverse backgrounds
who participate in a research experience, and ultimately choose careers as physician
scientists; (6) Promote research experiences that can develop into longer-term student-
faculty mentoring relationships; (7) Provide trainees with experience in scientific presentation
and publication of research and (8) Provide students with a high quality didactic program in
research with an emphasis on the ethical and responsible conduct of research. The NIH and
other institutions have recognized the need to increase the number of US physician scientists
and enhance the quality of healthcare and foster clinically relevant innovative research. The
short term research training program at the University of Michigan, with NRSA support, has
a strong record of meeting this need."

The program on Research Training in the Neuroscience of Aging provides predoctoral students in Neuroscience
with an integrated training experience in the laboratories of nationally and internationally recognized faculty. The
predoctoral training program builds on an exciting, translationally relevant curriculum taught in years one and
two of graduate school that has been awarded NIH support through the Jointly Sponsored Predoctoral Early
Stage T32 Training Program mechanism (T32 MH087004). This training program is the first at Mount Sinai to
focus specifically on the neuroscience of aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases (primarily
Alzheimer's disease), complementing Mount Sinai's historical concentration and strength in research in these
areas. Outstanding training faculty in this program share common research interests in the mechanisms of brain
function in health and disease, employing a diversity of experimental approaches and working at levels of
analysis ranging from molecular neurobiology to human neuropsychology and neuroimaging. The training
program specifically encourages participation of faculty mentors whose research grants directly focus on aging
neuroscience research, while not excluding those whose research expertise is critically important for the
interdisciplinary training we seek to impart. Through their coursework, predoctoral trainees will have received a
solid foundation in basic neurobiology and the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric diseases, as well
as biostatistics and the responsible conduct of research. Advanced coursework includes two seminar courses,
one on the biology of aging and one on the neuroscience of aging, complementing the broad foundational
coursework in neuroscience. Selection of a research mentor is made in a collaborative environment that actively
promotes multidisciplinary, integrative research. Research training also has a ‘work in progress’ component, to
foster important interdisciplinary interactions, hone presentation and writing skills, and improve awareness of
ethical issues. This program began in September of 2015 with 4 predoctoral training slots and to date has
supported 8 students, 2 of whom have already competed their PhD training. Using this approach, the program
on Research Training in the Neuroscience of Aging provides predoctoral students with the guidance and
experimental tools, in the laboratories of our training faculty, to launch successful, productive, and independent
careers in aging research."
10914024,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Deregulation of kinase function in cell signaling pathways is implicated in numerous cancers. In response, kinase
inhibitors (KIs) have been developed to interact with these kinases for highly specific treatment. Though nearly
50 KIs have been FDA-approved, KI monotherapy is seldom curative, likely owing to tumor heterogeneity and
acquired resistance. For example, intra-tumoral heterogeneity can result in the treatment of sensitive cell sub-
populations, while simultaneously promoting the outgrowth of resistant “persister cells.” In response, effective
combination therapies must be tailored to known resistance mechanisms to efficiently engage with their targets
and exploit cellular vulnerabilities. However, standard drug screening tools (e.g., plasma analysis, western blot
[WB]) are bulk in nature, and no established technology exists to quantify KI target engagement, concomitant
with local protein expression, while assessing tumor response heterogeneity. To address these shortcomings,
our group has (1) developed protocols to fluorescently label KIs (and other small molecule therapeutics) that
mimic the native drug, (2) advanced a novel intracellular paired agent imaging (iPAI) platform to quantify drug
target availability (DTA) with these fluorescent KIs, and (3) established and validated a highly multiplexed im-
munostaining strategy utilizing DNA barcoded antibodies, enabling in situ cyclic immunofluorescence (cyCIF)
imaging. In this proposal, we will combine these three complementary innovations into a fluorescence imaging
platform we call TRIPODD (Therapeutic Response Imaging through Proteomics and Optical Drug Distribution
and binding). Herein, we will use TRIPODD to demonstrate the capability of iPAI to predict mono- and combina-
torial KI drug response and uncover drug resistance mechanisms across whole tumor specimens with single-
cell resolution. To achieve this, iPAI will be expanded to three-color imaging (i.e., two-drug DTA) while cyCIF will
be applied to monitor proteomic therapeutic response to gain a mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant
combination therapy outcomes. Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation positive (EGFRmut+) non-small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which currently lacks curative treatment, will serve as our model system. We hypoth-
esize that TRIPODD—as the first technology capable of comparing drug distribution and binding (iPAI) directly
to proteomic markers (cyCIF) at the cellular level—will be critical to uncovering salient mechanisms of therapeutic
response and resistance in NSCLC and ultimately enable tailored therapeutic strategy optimization based on
predictive algorithms. This hypothesis will be tested through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Demonstrate
that TRIPODD can quantify targeted KI-monotherapy response. Aim 2: Establish TRIPODD protocols to accu-
rately characterize KI-combinatorial therapy outcomes. Successful completion of this proposal will yield an opti-
mized fluorescence imaging toolbox (TRIPODD) that will provide an unprecedented view of the spatial correla-
tions between drug distribution/binding (iPAI) and the underlying tumor/microenvironment proteome (cyCIF),
enabling mechanistic understanding of NSCLC treatment strategies."
10914125,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of overweight and hyperglycemia has markedly increased over the past four decades,
constituting a global health threat due to the association of these conditions with type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. A common dietary approach for the management and prevention of weight gain and
hyperglycemia is to replace sugar in the diet with non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) that do not elicit a
postprandial glycemic response and are calorie-free. Despite the immense popularity of this approach,
epidemiological evidence in humans suggests that NNS may in fact counterintuitively promote the same
conditions they aim to treat. For lack of insufficient evidence of causality and no clear mechanism through
which these “metabolically inert” compounds can affect human metabolism, their use is still widely endorsed.
In my graduate work, I demonstrated that three common NNS (saccharin, sucralose, aspartame) can promote
glucose intolerance in mice, and that this effect on metabolism is mediated by the disruptive effect of NNS
on the gut microbiome. The ongoing clinical trial that I am currently leading, together with my published work,
demonstrate that in humans, susceptibility to this detrimental effect is person-specific and depends on the
pre-exposure microbiome composition. While it is now evident that NNS can in fact cause metabolic
derangements, and that the microbiome mediates the effects of NNS on the host, the mechanisms through
which NNS shape the microbiome, and through which the NNS-perturbed microbiome affects host health,
remain unknown. As my data show direct interaction between NNS and the microbiome, in Aim 1 we will
determine if bacteria that bloom in the presence of NNS can metabolize the NNS compounds, identify the
products of these reactions, and determine whether these products are sufficient to affect host health. By
identifying NNS-responsive bacteria, we would be able to use the microbiome to predict which individuals
will be susceptible to their detrimental effects. While some bacteria bloom in the presence of NNS, other
diminish, and we will identify the mechanisms of NNS toxicity to bacteria. In Aim 2, we will identify the
mechanisms through which the NNS-perturbed microbiome affects metabolic health in mice. We will follow-
up on my observation that the NNS-perturbed microbiome has enhanced capacity for glycan degradation
and ask whether this leads to metabolic derangements in two downstream mechanisms including the
production of short chain fatty acids, and erosion of the intestinal mucus layer leading to metabolic
endotoxemia. We will complement these approaches by analyzing two large datasets of host transcriptome
and microbiome profile in NNS-exposed humans and mice. Collectively, these approaches would improve
our understanding of the microbiome contribution to the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, and support
evidence-based policies regarding health benefits and risks of NNS."
10914126,"Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a growing health concern as the global population ages. While many promising treatments for ADRD have been developed and tested, they have largely failed to prevent disease onset or slow disease progression in older adults. However, research has found that subtle signs of ADRD pathology are detectable decades before disease onset. To develop treatments that can slow the progression of ADRD before intractable deterioration of the brain has taken place, we will need to better understand the lifespan trajectory of cognitive, biological and brain aging and develop biomarkers that can connect subtle signs of individual differences in midlife aging to ADRD in late life.  In the F99 phase of the proposed research, the candidate will characterize signatures of midlife brain aging and investigate potential surrogate biomarkers using a multi-faceted approach in the Dunedin Study, a population representative birth cohort now in midlife. Specifically, the candidate will investigate the ability of widely used measures of risk for ADRD in older adults, including white matter hyperintensities and brain age, to measure accelerated cognitive and biological aging in midlife. The candidate will then develop a longitudinal measure from 20 years of biological aging across 19 biomarkers to investigate the consequences of accelerated pace of biological aging on individual differences in the structural integrity of the brain in midlife. Then the candidate will use childhood exposure to the neurotoxin lead, a known risk factor for ADRD, to further examine the utility of these candidate surrogate biomarkers to capture risk-related features of midlife brain aging.  In the K00 phase of the proposed research, the candidate will utilize statistical techniques, developed when creating the pace of biological aging in midlife, to measure correlated decline in brain biomarkers in healthy aging and ADRD in older adults.  The proposed research will yield techniques to measure accelerated biological aging in midlife and in older adults, as well as insights into ADRD through application of these measures. Critically, the proposed project will provide a deeper understanding of connections between midlife and late life accelerated aging that will contribute to growing efforts to target ADRD intervention earlier in life."

The ⍺-crystallins (⍺A- and ⍺B- isoforms) are essential for the development and lifelong transparency of the eye
lens. As molecular chaperones – members of the small heat shock protein family – the ⍺-crystallins play an
integral part of the stability of lens proteostasis and preventing the formation of age-related opacities (i.e., protein
aggregates) responsible for cataract formation. However, this system may become destabilized and/or
overwhelmed as a result of the long-lived nature of lens proteins, and ultimately contribute to disease
progression. Despite these fundamental roles in lens transparency and disease, there remains a critical gap in
our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the ⍺-crystallins function, and how these proteins
aggregate in response to aberrant (or age-related) conditions in the lens. A hallmark feature of the ⍺-crystallins
is a remarkable degree of structural plasticity that is driven by sub-domain interactions involving flexible N- and
C-termini, a feature that is thought to prevent crystallization under the highly concentrated environment of the
eye lens. This molecular plasticity also contributes to ⍺-crystallin chaperone function, allowing it to adapt to and
sequester a diverse range of destabilized proteins (aka clients) and prevent cytotoxic aggregation. However,
these same features of intrinsic dynamics have stymied previous efforts to obtain the detailed structural
characterizations (atomistic details) required to provide mechanistic insights into the function of these critical
components of the eye lens. The aims of this proposal will leverage recent advances in the state-of-the-art
methods of single particle CryoEM cryo-electron tomography (CryoET) – coupled with biophysical and functional
studies – in order to obtain high-resolution structural information regarding the mechanism of ⍺-crystallin
structural plasticity/polydispersity (Aim 1). Additional insights into the pathway(s) of chaperone/client co-
aggregation (Aim 2) will be garnered from NSEM, light scattering, and crosslinking-MS/MS methods. Success of
these aims will fill critical gaps in knowledge that have evaded the field for decades and provide detailed
mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of ⍺-crystallin’s hallmark of structural plasticity and how the lens
chaperone system becomes overwhelmed leading to cytotoxic protein aggregates such as those found in
cataract."

This renewal Advanced Research Training in Immunology for Surgery Trainees (ARTIST) is a specialized
training program that responds to the accelerating demand for expertise at the intersection of surgery and
translational immunology research and the critical need to ensure a pipeline of surgeon-scientists. The long-
term goal of the program is to inspire and train the next generation of surgeon-scientists who will lead
immunology research focused on solutions for clinical problems relevant to tissue injury, repair, regeneration
and replacement. Discoveries by these surgeon-scientists are anticipated to lead to new tools for diagnosis or
prognosis of immune-mediated diseases and also to new immunotherapies. Program objectives are achieved
by recruitment of outstanding trainees with innate curiosity and the aspiration to become leaders in surgery,
selection of high quality interdisciplinary and collaborative NIH-funded faculty, and engagement in innovative
didactics and professional development activities. Eligible trainees are competitively selected from an
outstanding pool of surgery residents who have completed at least two years of clinical training in the Ohio
State University (OSU) General Surgery residency program, in other surgical subspecialty residencies at OSU
Wexner Medical Center and Nationwide Children’s Hospital or in general surgery residency programs at other
institutions. The diversity of the surgical trainee pool is a strength of the ARTIST program and will contribute to
the quality and diversity of the future biomedical surgeon-scientist workforce. Surgical trainees are prepared for
the mentored research experience far in advance of the T32 training period in order to optimize their research
success and productivity. Each trainee dedicates a minimum of two years without clinical responsibilities to
conduct mentored research, participate in immunology focused didactics (earning a Masters of Medical
Science (MMS) degree) and engage in professional development activities. MMS requirements include
coursework in Immunology, Rigorous Research Design, Biostatistics, Grant Writing, and Research Ethics.
Trainees are required to take “Career Development for Surgeons” course and “Applications of Immunology in
Surgery” journal club. Trainees also have ample opportunity to participate in OSU institutional research
workshops, seminars and career development activities. After completion of the research training program,
trainees transition back to complete 2-3 more years of surgical training. During this time, they continue to
publish, present at national meetings, compete for awards and participate in research and professional
development activities. To date, 17 trainees (4 URM) have been appointed, 2 are in training, 15 completed the
program (no attrition), achieved high productivity (publications, presentations, competitive awards), 3 exceeded
program milestones and earned PhD degree. Ten of 15 who completed both research and clinical training
placed into prestigious fellowships (9) and one proceeded directly into an academic faculty position and 5
remain in clinical training. We plan to appoint 5 postdoctoral trainees per year, each for 2 years duration."

GlyGen is a maturing (five years old) knowledgebase that accumulates data in the glycobiology domain and
connects it with other data types. GlyGen is unique; no other present or prior informatic resource has undertaken
such an integrative mission. In part, the lagging growth of accessible knowledge in the glycobiology domain,
compared to other -omics or biomedical research fields, reflects the inherent complexity of glycan structures,
which, unlike genes and proteins, exist in branched and isomeric forms whose biosynthesis is not attributable to
well-characterized, template-driven processes such as transcription or translation. Rather, glycan biosynthesis
is mediated by the regulated expression of ensembles of glycosyltransferases, substrate transporters, and
secretory pathway regulatory mechanisms that together generate dynamic cell- and tissue-specific patterns of
protein and lipid glycosylation. In addition, each glycosylation site on a glycoprotein may routinely be modified
by one of an ensemble of glycan structures, a glycoprotein feature called microheterogeneity. Importantly,
microheterogeneity is not random, but reflects the intrinsic biosynthetic capacity of specific cells and tissues and
may be modified by disease. These structural and biosynthetic complexities are essential contributors to the
tissue- and disease-specific functions of glycans and glycosylation, and, therefore, need to be captured and
represented in knowledgebases in a way that they can be queried and linked to other types of data. GlyGen
aims to expand its underlying data model to accommodate new and more complex datatypes, augmenting and
integrating new data types, and implementing robust modeling, unified procedures, and tools to improve
discovery and exploration of glycan and glycoconjugate data. Enhancement of the overall resource functionality
will be achieved through front-end improvements to accommodate user preferences and ensure exceptional data
communication and visualization. Improving the interconnectivity of GlyGen and its partner databases as well as
enhancing data-sharing across resources will continue to be core principles of the GlyGen project. All resulting
harmonized data will be available through highly permissive licenses for easy integration into other resources,
such as NCBI, EBI, SIB and other international efforts, as well as for easy repurposing by independent
researchers, educators, bioinformaticians, and commercial entities. By the end of the next project period GlyGen
expects to become the go-to, well-integrated resource for glycoscience data, similar to existing protein and
genomic resources and serving the same broad community of biomedical researchers."

10935866,"PROJECT SUMMARY -PROJECT 2
Hepatocellular carcinoma is (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and 3rd leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide. HCC etiology is rapidly changing toward metabolic drivers and is a growing medical threat.
Cellular insults cause accumulation of misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which activates the
unfolded protein response (UPR) in human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and HCC and is a negative
prognosticator for outcome in solid tumors. The UPR causes cleavage and activation of the transcription factor
ATF6 to produce the ATF6p50 fragment that migrates to the nucleus for transcription of ER chaperones and
metabolic genes. Our new findings show that ATF6 promotes HCC: a) Nuclear ATF6p50 is elevated in human
HCC tumor samples compared to non-tumor tissues and is associated with downregulation of the tumor
suppressor fructose 1,6, bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1); b) Expression of ATF6p50 promotes HCC in mice; and c)
Deletion of ATF6 reduces tumor incidence in mice. We hypothesize that ATF6p50 in hepatocytes promotes
HCC through ER stress, UPR induction, and increased cholesterol synthesis leading to a metabolic
imbalance favoring a malignant state which we will test: 1) Can discoveries from the mouse be translated to
human tissues and preclinical human HCC models for insight into mechanism and potential intervention? We
will analyze human HCC tissue samples by digital spatial profiling and next generation sequencing to define
ATF6p50-specific transcriptome signatures, associating ATF6p50 positivity with genes encoding ER,
mitochondria, or cytosolic functions in human HCC. We will decipher targetable mechanisms and assess the
therapeutic benefit of targeting ATF6 in xenografts of surgically resected tumor specimens obtained from NASH-
related HCC patients; 2) How does ATF6 exert its oncoprotein role in HCC? The role of ATF6 cleavage/activation
in driving HCC will focus on: a) Can UPR activation and cell death promote HCC in combination with oncogenic
drivers; b) Does ATF6 synergizes with NRF2 and/or play a parallel role through common downstream targets to
promote HCC, such as FBP1 (with Project 1); Activated NRF2 and ATF6 have overlapping signatures correlating
with human HCC omics datasets (with Core 2) and both suppress FBP1 to increase TCA cycle-related
oncometabolites (with Core 1); c) Metabolic reprogramming via increased cholesterol synthesis (with Project
3); and 3) Does genetic or pharmacological inactivation of ATF6 prevent NASH-HCC? We will perform
transcriptional, translational, and metabolomic analyses to define the impact of altered ATF6 signaling in HCC
cell lines and PDXs that will be orthotopically transplanted into syngeneic high-fat/fructose diet-fed mice to
monitor HCC progression. We will test whether ER protein misfolding drives NASH to HCC progression, which
may be rescued by ATF6 antisense oligonucleotides or small molecule ATF6 inhibitors. Projects 1-3 provide
synergy for the opportunity to advance understanding of nutrient excess and dysregulated interactions between
the ER, nucleus, cytosol, and mitochondria, linking ATF6, NRF2, FBP1, SAB+STARD1 in NASH-HCC."
10939140,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ANIMAL MODELS MODULE
 The Vanderbilt Vision Research Center (VVRC) includes faculty investigators with strong interest in
discerning relationships between visual circuits and behavior, between cortical structures and physiology, and
between brain regions and perception/behavior in non-human primate and prosimian species. These
cognitive- and systems-level investigations require access to expert veterinary husbandry and surgical skills,
especially for longitudinal studies requiring use of the same animal cohort over many months. Many of these
investigators and those using smaller rodents have increasing need of veterinary support for noninvasive live
imaging through the Center for Small Animal Imaging (CSAI) within the Vanderbilt University Institute for
Imaging Science, while others require expert guidance on animal model development, protocols, and
specialized care during longitudinal experimentation. The purpose of the VVRC Animals Models Module, which
is housed in Wilson Hall near primary users and directed by NEI R01 funded Christos Constantinidis, is to
provide a comprehensive veterinary service for support of vision research using non-human primates and other
mammals that is not covered by staff members supported by individual grants. This module is a VVRC-intrinsic
core administered through the Department of Psychology and is provided to VVRC members by request and
not through the VUMC Office of Research scholarship platform. In the current funding cycle, 6 investigators
with current NEI R01 awards used the Animal Models service for experiments with non-human primate or pro-
simian species (Calkins, Constantinidis, Kaas, Maier, and Tong), as did an additional 4 investigators with NEI
pending NEI R01 proposals (Bastos, Rex, Wareham, Woodman). Other vision scientists with NIH funding
round out this particular user base (Hoffman, Ramachandran, Wallace, Womelsdorf, and Woodman. In the
current funding period, the Animal Models service contributed material for 101 publications involving 13 VVRC
faculty authors. Projected use of the service module is considerable, with 11 of 16 current NEI R01 grant
holders projecting moderate (6) to extensive (5) use of the core. Of our 7 members with NEI RO1 proposals in
review, 5 will have moderate to extensive use. Leveraging this success, the VVRC Animal Services Module
will: (1) provide expert assistance with nonhuman primate surgical procedures, (2) provide training on best,
aseptic, nonhuman primate surgical practices, (3) support breeding of prosimian species used for vision
research, (4) facilitate access to and use of a multi-modal set of imaging tools for the study of vision in animal
models, and (5) provide veterinary guidance and expertise for model and protocol development. These
services and resources will enhance the scope of experimentation NEI-funded VVRC investigators conduct,
promote innovation through specialized veterinary procedures to those who otherwise would not have such
capabilities, including early-career vision scientists competing for extramural funding for their laboratories and
established investigators who rely upon the use of non-human primates for their research."

10892985,"The ability to control and monitor the maturation of human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 
tissues is critical for tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, pharmacology, and synthetic biology. This 
proposal presents an artificial intelligence (Al)-driven ""cyborg tissue"" platform that integrates tissue-like 
flexible electronic sensors and actuators with developing tissues and provides multimodal recording and 
control. Machine learning-based mathematical models will be built to integrate the data and tissue 
maturation status readout through the in situ single-cell RNA sequencing. This closed-loop system will 
control the tissue-wide distributed electrical actuations to promote tissue development. The aim is to use 
hiPSC-derived cardiac organoids as a model system to demonstrate that this Al-driven cyborg tissue 
platform can improve the maturation and eliminate the variations in patient-specific hiPSC-derived tissue 
samples. 
Specifically, flexible and stretchable mesh nanoelectronics with miniaturized multifunctional sensors and 
electrical stimulators will be fully implanted, integrated, and distributed across the entire three-dimensional 
(3D) volume of organoids for continuous, multiplexed sensing and actuation. Additionally, in situ 
electro-sequencing will be used to combine spatially resolved single-cell molecular phenotypes with the 
functional readouts from the electronics. A statistical learning architecture will be developed for modeling, 
testing, and interpreting multimodal electrical activities, mechanical contractile, gene regulatory, and 
signaling networks to determine the functional maturation of the organoids. Finally, a feedback control 
system will be implemented for real-time experimental design enhancement, electrical stimulation 
optimization, and model refinement to improve the functional maturation of cardiac organoids. 
The success of this work will potentially provide an improved mechanistic understanding of how genetic, 
molecular, electrical, and mechanical processes regulate the maturation of the hiPSC-derived cardiac 
organoids and establish an Al-controlled bioelectronics system to sense and control the functional 
maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiac organoids for various regenerative medicine and pharmacological applications. The technology is likely to be generalizable to help scientists understand the maturation and 
functions of virtually any kind of developing tissue and organoid systems and even in vivo systems. This 
proposed research will combine AI, machine learning, computational biology, biomedical informatics and 
multimodal cell data to advance stem cell maturation and enable new data-driven discovery, which aligns with 
the mission of the National Library of Medicine."
10936336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and affect
millions of patients, especially elderly women. Antibiotics do not reliably eliminate uropathogens and there is an
urgent need for more effective treatments to improve UTI patient outcomes. Thorough understanding of microbe-
host interactions in the urinary system will be key to the development of next generation immune therapies.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a key component of innate immunity, but the functions of these peptides have
been very difficult to study due to the lack of animal models. The largest mammalian AMP family, the defensins,
has >50 members in mice, and deleting any single gene does not result in a strong phenotype. In my postdoctoral
work, I solved this problem by generating a Defensin cluster knockout (Def cKO) mouse line removing all Def
genes in select tissues. My previous work focused on skin immunity and established the necessity of defensins
and novel defensin receptors in anti-bacterial immunity. In my independent lab, I will shift my focus from the skin
to a niche that is entirely new to me – the urinary tract. In this Stephen J. Katz application, I propose to utilize
unique and innovative genetic tools to analyze the functions of defensins and defensin receptors in a mouse
model of UTI. We hypothesize that defensins are important for anti-UTI immunity, but are also a main cause of
UTI-mediated pelvic pain. We have three independent aims: Aim 1 will examine whether defensins synthesized
and secreted by bladder epithelial cells contribute to the epithelium’s immunity against UPEC invasion. We will
study defensin interactions with both intracellular and extracellular bacteria. Aim 2 will systematically characterize
the defensin-related immune response in UTI using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) analyses and
compare infected bladder tissues of wild type (WT) and Def cKO animals. This will allow us to identify all cell
populations whose numbers and transcriptomes are altered by the lack of defensins. We will then focus on a few
innate immune cell types with known defensin receptors, neutrophils, mast cells and dendritic cells, and explore
the significance of defensin-immune cell signaling in urinary immunity. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
defensins released in the bladder during UTI activate urinary nociceptive neurons and contribute to UTI-mediated
pelvic pain. We will measure pelvic pain behaviors and urination frequencies of UPEC-infected WT and Def cKO
mice as well as mice whose defensin-responsive neurons are genetically removed. The proposed project will be
the first comprehensive loss-of-function analysis of defensins in the urinary system. This will also be one of the
first surveys of neuroimmune crosstalk in the urinary tract. The immediate goal for this project is to understand
the cell types and cell surface receptors that respond to defensins in UTI. The ultimate goal of my research
program is to develop better treatments for UTI by targeting specific immune defensin receptors to enhance
innate immunity while limiting painful side effects caused by neuronal activation."

Neuroscience has been revolutionized by the widespread adoption of two experimental methods: optogenetics,
where light is used to control neural activity, and calcium imaging, where light is used to monitor neural activity.
‘Sculpted Light in The Brain’ refers to the optical process of changing the shape of light to be more useful for
both imaging and stimulation purposes and is a fundamental theme of this conference. With the advent of these
approaches conventional electrical recording and stimulation tools are being progressively complemented and
sometimes replaced by these light-based approaches. However, progress is still needed for these optical
techniques to reach the speed, specificity, and range necessary to understand neural activity. This meeting is
timely since this new generation of advanced light-based biological tools is fundamentally transforming how
neuroscientists interrogate the nervous system, relying on the fusion of computational and optical methods with
neuroscience.
The repeated success of the SLB meetings highlights the timely nature of this topic and the extreme interest in
the topic. Sculpted Light in the Brain (2017) was originally designed as a brief (1 day) local conference at
University of California at Berkeley. However, due to overwhelming interest as well as the engagement and
commitment of the organizers, the meeting was rapidly expanded to a reoccurring international meeting series,
having meetings in London (2019), Boston (2022), and now Paris (2024). Feedback was overwhelmingly
positive, and the conference was highlighted in Neurophotonics (Shanker et al 2017), spawned a dedicated
research grant just for meeting attendees (The Kavli SLB Innovation Grant (2022)), has been spoken of as a
model of conference childcare support, and sparked enduring scientific collaborations. The program for the 2024
Sculpted Light in the Brain meeting was designed by an interdisciplinary, international committee guided by
suggestions from the field. The meeting organizers include four returning members from the 2022 and 2019
organization teams, as well as 3 new members. Four of the seven meeting organizers are women, and two are
based internationally. They are aided by the continued support of the SLB Board (the original six organizers) and
an advisory group of senior scientists.
This meeting will generate future collaboration opportunities by gathering established scientists and the next
generation of researchers from the fields of optics, computer science, and neuroscience in a discussion focused
on developing future light-based technologies that will enable real time communication with the living brain. This
forward-looking unique new conference satisfies an urgent need in the scientific community that is currently
completely unmet, since there are no other standalone meetings directly dedicated to this rapidly growing
scientific area."
10936232,"Project summary/abstract
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and overactivity of the sympathetic branch of
the autonomic nervous system (sympatho-excitation) plays a key role in the pathogenesis or progression of
numerous cardiovascular diseases. Overactivity of cardiac sympathetic neurons leads to increased release of
neuropeptide Y (NPY), the major neuropeptide in the heart. Excess NPY release has been correlated with worse
outcomes in heart failure, where it is speculated to be arrhythmogenic and contribute to sudden cardiac death.
Our long-term goal is to understand what molecular changes occur within cardiac sympathetic neurons during
sympatho-excitiation that contribute to the increased release of NPY in cardiovascular disease. The central
hypothesis of this grant is that increased NPY levels in sympatho-excitation are attributable to enhanced
trafficking, synaptic localization, and exocytic fusion of NPY-containing vesicles in postganglionic sympathetic
neurons. These studies represent a major change in research direction for the investigator who previously
studied neuropathic pain. We will utilize our novel high-resolution, live-cell imaging techniques developed to
study the dynamic regulation of nociceptors, and adapt them to investigating the pathological regulation of the
heart in cardiovascular disease. Using a compartmentalized chamber, we will co-culture sympathetic neurons
from the superior cervical ganglia of neonatal rats with ventricular myocytes to form neuro-cardiac junctions. The
central hypothesis will be tested using the following aims: 1) To observe the real-time relationship between
sympathetic neuron firing rates and release of NPY, 2) To determine whether the formation of neuro-cardiac
junctions enhances the trafficking of NPY-containing vesicles to and capture within synaptic varicosities, and 3)
To determine whether sympathetic neurons from a neurogenic model of cardiovascular disease (spontaneously
hypertensive rats; SHRs) exhibit increased baseline excitability, including increased release of NPY. The results
of these innovative studies will represent the first report of the dynamic regulation of vesicular trafficking and
neuropeptide release in sympathetic neurons, and could transform how we detect and treat some cardiovascular
diseases."
10936363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nonsense or missense mutations of the CHAMP1 gene, which encodes for a zinc-finger protein involved in the
maintenance of kinetochore-microtubule attachment during mitosis and regulation of chromosomal segregation,
causes a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by intellectual disability (ID), ASD-like behaviors,
microcephaly, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features. CHAMP1 interacts with POGZ, which encodes for a gene
that causes the White-Sutton syndrome, and it is known that the interaction of these two proteins is lost in the
presence of mutations. To date, 36 disease rare variants in CHAMP1 have been reported across studies
comprising nonsense, missense, and frameshift mutations. Recently, a Champ1+/- mouse model showed
relatively mild learning and memory impairment and depression-like behaviors and delayed neuronal
differentiation. Despite the mouse data, there is yet no study that focused on the human brain leaving the role of
CHAMP1 in human brain development totally unexplored.
As such, our central hypothesis is that CHAMP1 loss of function alter neurogenesis and neuronal migration in
human brain resulting in dysfunction of cortical local circuits.
We propose a series of complementary approaches, including high-resolution imaging, single-cell multiomics,
and electrophysiology tools to explore CHAMP1 loss of function in the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Determine the influence of CHAMP1 loss of function in the development of forebrain cortical
organoids.
Specific Aim 2. Profile single cell level transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of CHAMP1 loss of function
organoids at different developmental stages.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the effect of CHAMP1 loss of function in neuronal activity and local network."

 Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death and illness in our society and causes 30% of
cancer deaths. Despite this, 28.3 million US adults smoke. Most of them (70%) want to quit smoking someday, but
are not yet ready to quit or actively seeking treatment--they are ambivalent about quitting. Available evidence-based
stop-smoking treatments (medication and counseling) are not typically offered to people who are ambivalent about
quitting smoking (PAQS) due to cost and limited resources, but to meaningfully reduce smoking prevalence, low-
cost, scalable interventions are needed that can effectively engage PAQS, encourage them to stop smoking, and
support them through this process, including connecting them to available evidence-based treatment when they are
ready to quit. The current proposal is responsive to this public health goal and to NCI’s call for innovative, scalable
mobile health (mHealth) smoking cessation interventions. Building on our programmatic work developing digital
therapeutics for smoking cessation, population-level motivational interventions, and user-centered design and
development work with PAQS, we designed a mHealth app (called GEMS) which blends sound scientific theory,
evidence-based treatment, and best practice recommendations with novel, theory-based content that is responsive
to the needs and preferences of PAQS. The backbone of the intervention is a series of sequential, self-guided
exercises (called ‘personal experiments’) designed especially to help PAQS clarify their health goals; build and
strengthen their motivation and confidence for quitting smoking; and teach them the skills necessary to change their
smoking behavior. This content is paired with action-oriented guidance how to quit, an ability to earn free nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT), and in-app direct access to free evidence-based tobacco quitline counseling, as well
other tools designed to enhance engagement with the app, motivation, and self-efficacy. Findings from a recent
randomized pilot of GEMS (n = 57) were positive. Compared to an identical version of the app without the personal
experiments, GEMS was used more often, more users earned the free NRT and requested this treatment, and
more accessed free quitline counseling within the app. Moreover, twice as many GEMS users reported smoking
abstinence at follow-up. We now propose to test the efficacy of GEMS in a fully-powered randomized controlled trial
(n=800) using nationwide recruitment via social media and from a large health care system to recruit a diverse,
representative sample of PAQS. Co-primary outcomes will be objectively measured requests for either NRT or
quitline counseling accessed through the app and smoking abstinence at 6-months post-enrollment. App utilization,
smoking reduction, and other tobacco or treatment use will also be examined. GEMS is the first known app
designed exclusively for PAQS. If effective, it could provide a novel, highly scalable tool for increasing treatment use
and smoking abstinence among PAQS, thereby addressing a significant and under-researched public health gap."
10938229,"Proximity labeling (PL) has emerged as a powerful approach for elucidating subcellular proteomes. In PL, a
catalyst is localized to a subcellular region of interest, where it tags nearby endogenous proteins; the tagged
proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Although PL catalysts have enabled numerous
biological discoveries, new PL catalysts are needed to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spatially resolved
proteomic mapping. For example, genetically encoded enzyme catalysts (such as APEX and BioID) can be
conveniently targeted to cellular locations of interest, but they are limited in their chemical mechanisms of
tagging, which hampers control over the labeling radius (limiting specificity) and restricts which amino acids can
be tagged (limiting sensitivity). Recently, synthetic PL catalysts have enabled a greater diversity of chemical
labeling mechanisms, but new approaches are needed for selective activation of these catalysts in highly specific
subcellular regions of interest. My group has developed three classes of hybrid biological-abiotic PL catalysts,
offering improved sensitivity and specificity for spatially-resolved proteomic mapping. Each class of catalyst
offers complementary advantages, and the three aims will be pursued independently. In Aim 1, we have used
directed evolution to discover heme peroxidase enzymes capable of generating highly reactive radicals, which
exhibit a shorter diffusion radius compared to the widely used APEX/biotin phenol methodology, allowing for
enhanced spatial resolution. Additionally, we are developing peroxidase-based PL methodologies to label
chemically diverse amino acids, in contrast to the APEX approach that almost exclusively labels tyrosines. This
ability to react with more amino acids will enhance sensitivity for detecting proximal proteins. In Aim 2, we have
developed hybrid DNA-synthetic PL catalysts that become activated only in highly specific subcellular locations.
We are applying these switchable catalysts for activation of PL selectively at protein–protein interactions (PPIs)
on the surface of cancer cells, and we will extend this approach for activation at intercellular PPIs in neuronal
synapses. In Aim 3, we have developed hybrid DNA-synthetic catalysts that tag proteins through contact-
dependent mechanisms, instead of generating diffusible reactive species. We will attach these contact-
dependent catalysts to DNA nano-rod structures with tunable lengths and rigidities, enabling precise control over
the labeling radius in the range of ~1–50 nm. For all three research areas, we are applying the novel PL catalysts
for proteomic mapping in living mammalian cells, in collaboration with Prof. Lloyd Smith, an expert in high-
resolution biomolecular mass spectrometry. Additionally, we are collaborating with Prof. Edwin Chapman to
employ these PL tools in cultured neurons to benchmark their performance against existing tools. Throughout
the next five years, my laboratory will continue to develop new mechanisms for PL using hybrid abiotic-biological
catalysts. I envision that these tools will be employed not only in my laboratory, but also in the broader
community, to elucidate novel protein functions in a variety of biological contexts."

With the global implementation of prenatal antiretroviral therapy (ART), over 18 million individuals born to
mothers with HIV have been HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU). While infants and children with HEU are known
to be at increased risk of adverse health outcomes, the long-term implications of in utero HIV/ART exposure into
adulthood have not been well explored. The candidate has generated novel preliminary data to show an
increased prevalence of obesity in adolescents and young adults with HEU versus well-matched controls. These
findings convey the compelling need to characterize the extent of metabolic and immune dysregulation among
young adults with HEU, and to delineate molecular pathways that may underlie this phenotype. Candidate: Dr.
Fourman is an endocrinologist and clinical investigator at Harvard Medical School dedicated to identifying novel
mechanisms and treatment strategies for metabolic disease. Her overarching career goal is to become an
independent R01-funded clinical investigator committed to preventing and treating obesity and metabolic disease
in the rapidly growing HEU population, as well as in other groups exposed to abnormal intrauterine environments.
Training: To achieve this goal, Dr. Fourman has developed a career development plan that provides targeted
training in developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD), immunologic aspects of metabolic disease,
design and interpretation of epigenetic studies, and social and behavioral determinants of health. Mentors: The
candidate’s career development and research plans are overseen by her primary mentor, Dr. Steven Grinspoon,
who is an internationally recognized leader in metabolic disease research in HIV. The applicant also is supported
by a highly invested team of co-mentors and advisors with expertise in DOHaD, epigenetics, immunology,
infectious diseases, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Research: Dr. Fourman is leveraging her background in
endocrinology and HIV to test the innovative hypothesis that the HIV intrauterine environment influences fetal
development to confer an increased susceptibility to metabolic and immune dysregulation later in life.
Specifically, she will conduct the first prospective study that compares long-term health outcomes in young adults
with HEU versus well-matched controls without HIV exposure or infection. In Aims 1-2, Dr. Fourman will delineate
the downstream metabolic and immune sequelae of in utero HIV/ART exposure among young adults with HEU.
In Aim 3, she will investigate the contribution of epigenetic modifications to the HEU phenotype. This project
stands to establish in utero HIV/ART exposure as a previously unrecognized risk factor for metabolic disease.
Only by defining long-term metabolic and immune perturbations among the HEU population can screening and
prevention strategies be tailored toward this group. Funding from this administrative supplement will accelerate
the candidate’s completion of her K23 project and career development plan following the critical life event of
childbirth. With this support, Dr. Fourman will be poised to achieve her full potential as an independent
investigator geared toward redressing metabolic disease as approached from a developmental perspective."

This proposal describes the framework of an NIAID New Innovators DP2 award for Kiera Clayton, PhD. Dr.
Clayton is currently a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Walker at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard, whose current research focuses on T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected
macrophages, and the implications for HIV reservoir persistence and macrophage-mediated inflammation. In
addition to Dr. Clayton’s published work suggesting that macrophages are resistant to T cell-mediated killing,
preliminary results included in this proposal suggest that HIV exploits macrophages to evade NK cell-mediated
killing, by mechanisms distinct from those used to evade T cell responses. As macrophages also act as the
primary cellular reservoir for other chronic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the question
remains whether macrophages provide a common “Hide-Out” for immunoevasion. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms employed by macrophages infected by different chronic pathogens
to evade immune-mediated clearance and explore the possibility of targeting a common immunoevasion
pathway to enhance T cell and NK cell killing of infected macrophages. This proposal focuses on three Research
Areas. The first Research Area will build on preliminary data to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected
macrophages prevent NK cell-mediated killing. To quantify the resistance of macrophages infected with Mtb to
T cell and NK cell-mediated elimination and characterize the accompanying immunoevasion mechanisms, the
second Research Area will characterize the interactions between Mtb-infected macrophage and antigen-specific
T cells and NK cells. Finally, as Dr. Clayton’s published work suggests that inefficient killing of macrophages is
a result of resistance to apoptosis-inducing T cell-derived granzymes, the third Research Area will probe for the
identities of granzyme inhibitors expressed by macrophages, and subsequently knockout candidate genes to
enhance T and NK cell-mediated killing of infected macrophages. Together, these studies will provide insight
into whether targeting natural granzyme inhibitors can provide a common method to enhance immune-mediated
clearance of macrophages infected by different pathogens. The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the
mission of NIAID, and will enhance our understanding of distinct pathogen-specific immunoevasion mechanisms
and those inherently characteristic of macrophages that allow for pathogen persistence despite strong immune
responses. Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target HIV and Mtb
infection in macrophages, and will potentiate future studies to assess how macrophage-mediated
immunoevasion contributes to persistence of other pathogens, including human cytomegalovirus."

compensatory use of cognitive resources, collectively known as listening effort (LE), as a key change within the
ageing and hearing-impaired populations. Additionally, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), whose cognitive deficits compromise their ability to efficiently utilize LE mechanisms
for coping with distracting information, exhibit substantial deficits in perception of speech in the presence of
competing talkers. However, the neural underpinnings of these behavioral deficits in MCI remain poorly
understood, including the relative extent to which neurobiological changes in the brain due to AD affect lower-
level processing of speech acoustics versus higher-level mechanisms involved in linguistic processing.
Moreover, because cortical processing of continuous speech in people with MCI due to AD has been virtually
unexplored, it is unknown whether such measures could have utility as a neural biomarker for early, affordable
diagnostics of AD, as well as for tracking of AD progression. The present proposal aims to address both of these
key goals by collecting the first data set of continuous speech processing under varying listening effort demands
in people with MCI due to AD and matched controls. In Aim 1, we will address the question of how neurobiological
changes due to AD influence cortical processing of acoustic and linguistic features of speech in MCI. In a sample
of participants with MCI due to AD with AD biomarkers, as well as matched controls, we will measure non-
invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to continuous narrative audiobooks presented either in
isolation (Low LE condition) or dichotically in the presence of a distracting secondary audiobook (High LE
condition). Model-based temporal response function (TRF) analyses will subsequently be used to derive
responses to a range of acoustic and linguistic features of speech to assess how MCI status and LE demands
interact in cortical processing of speech. In Aim 2, we will test whether cortical responses to speech can be
reliably used to, 1), classify the MCI (vs. control) status of individual participants, and 2), predict speech
comprehension performance and scores on cognitive battery tests (e.g., working memory capacity, attentional
inhibition scores). These goals will be achieved by building cross-validated classification and regression models
to identify which features (acoustics vs. linguistic), conditions (clean vs dichotic speech), and types of neural
measures (e.g., feature tracking strength vs. response latencies) are most reliable for classifying MCI status and
predicting behavioral scores. This work will provide a foundation for future grant proposals aimed at elucidating
perceptual and neural consequences of AD, and identification of novel and affordable biomarkers of AD useful
for early detection of AD, tracking of disease progression, and evaluation of novel clinical interventions."

Aging has a pronounced effect on the human brain, yet differences between individuals can be substantial, and
are likely influenced by genetic, environmental lifestyle factors, including several modifiable risk factors that may
impact brain aging and play a role in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD related dementias (ADRD).
However, timely recognition and understanding of accelerated brain aging and the onset of neurodegeneration
underlying AD is needed in order to identify individuals at risk and take preventive measures.
 So far, most brain-age research uses structural neuroimaging to index brain volume, which sensitivity is
inherently limited to the millimeter resolution of MRI. Instead, we will use advanced, yet clinically feasible diffusion
MRI, which provides a unique window to the mesoscopic scale, intermediate between molecular and voxel
dimensions, where aging and distinct pathological processes happen. We hypothesize high sensitivity of dMRI
to determine brain-age and deterioration due to AD/ADRD. In addition, the role of white matter in aging and
AD/ADRD is still unclear, and particularly the exact contribution of both neuro-inflammatory processes (gliosis,
astrocytosis, macrophage infiltration) and neurodegenerative processes (demyelination, axonal degeneration
and loss). The desired specificity is attainable using our mesoMRI modeling approach.
 In response of RFA-AG-24-018, we propose to develop a biologically relevant multi-scale model of brain
aging using our in vivo mesoMRI approach, which holds enormous untapped potential to bridge the meso-macro
gap and disentangle the extent of neuro-inflammation and neurodegeneration. We will leverage the unique
presence at NYU Langone Healthy (NYULH) of a large series of mesoMRI scans of control, patient and subjects
of the well-characterized cohort of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) along with a large
collection of brain specimen of both controls and various dementia diagnosis.
 We propose in the R21-phase to create a large advanced, multi-shell dMRI dataset, unifying several large-
scale dMRI datasets along with our local NYULH cohort extracted from routine clinical MRI datasets and
electronic health record data. We will generate brain charts of quantitative dMRI and mesoMRI markers across
the life-span, to then create a brain microstructure age framework. In the R33-phase, we evaluate the effect of
race/ethnicity, sex and life style factors on aging and evaluate the sensitivity of brain microstructure to increased
aging, neuro-inflammation and neuro-degeneration along the continuum of AD/ADRD, in addition to validation
in postmortem human brain using histopathology and proteomics, and evaluation of longitudinal changes.
 Impact: Achieve a brain-age framework based on clinically feasible dMRI scans with robust sensitivity that
provides meaningful insight into the microstructural processes underlying brain aging and AD/ADRD and will
enable quantitative assessment of treatment response to future symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies."

 The long-term goal of our research is to develop first-in-class, protein-based inhibitors against
human bacterial pathogens by directly blocking efflux pumps. Drug resistant bacteria pose an
urgent global health challenge by reducing the effectiveness of antibiotics used to treat infections
in humans and animals. The broadest resistance mechanism against antibiotics are efflux pumps,
which transport drugs out of the cytoplasm and reduce toxicity to the organism. While it is known
that efflux pumps display broad specificity to structurally distinct compounds, the mechanisms of
polyspecific drug binding and ion-coupled transport remain unanswered questions in the field.
Given the promiscuity of efflux pump binding to structurally distinct drugs, it is also unclear
whether potent and selective efflux pump inhibitors can be designed to target specific classes of
efflux pumps. The specific goals of this project are to discover novel mechanisms of active
transport in drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and to harness this knowledge to design
selective inhibitors toward efflux pumps. Our proposal is strongly motivated by our recent
discovery of antibody fragments (Fabs) that bind the Staphylococcus aureus efflux pump NorA
and successful determination of high-resolution cryoEM structures using the Fabs as fiduciaries.
The structures revealed that the Fabs insert a loop into the substrate binding pocket from the
extracellular side, which suggests a design path toward protein- and peptide-based inhibitors.
This interaction is facilitated by an electrostatic interaction between a positively charged arginine
on the Fab and two essential anionic residues within NorA. Building on these preliminary data,
we propose to carry out four Specific Aims. Aim 1 will develop a hybrid approach of cryo-electron
microscopy and NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively study the transport cycle of NorA. Aim 2
will seek to determine the molecular basis for polyspecific drug binding. Aim 3 will design and
characterize protein-based inhibitors that target the accessible, outward-open conformation of
NorA. Aim 4 will develop peptides that miniaturize the antibody loops observed in the binding
pocket of NorA. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in structural biology,
protein engineering, microbiology, chemical synthesis, and computational chemistry to rapidly
answer fundamental questions about multidrug transport and inhibition of efflux pumps. All of the
approaches applied to NorA will be translatable to other transporter systems."

including Alzheimer’s Disease, in transgender populations. The project’s main aim will be to use a robust
method of identifying transgender individuals within claims data to assess rates of dementia diagnoses among
transgender persons compared to cisgender referents. Completing the proposed aims will 1) demonstrate the
utility of prior work by utilizing methods validated in the parent grant; 2) reveal further evidence in a unique
population of traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease that are linked dementia; and 3) inform future
research into aging and dementia prevention in transgender populations. By engaging in mentored research
with Drs. Emelia Benjamin (Mentor), Michael Paasche-Orlow (Mentor), Howard Cabral (Mentor), and Sari
Reisner (Mentor), and collaborators, and participating in seminars, conferences, and regular mentoring
meetings, I will develop expertise in four new areas critical to my development as an independent clinician-
scientist evaluating health outcomes to characterize and mitigate CVD and dementia risks for transgender
individuals: 1) Quantitative methods to analyze claims-based & electronic health record data; 2) Quantitative
methods to assess prediction models; 3) Clinical skills in transgender endocrinology, cardiology, & preventive
care. Moreover, I will extend my grant writing and oral presentation skills by participating in grant writing
courses and presenting at research meetings and seminars. Boston University offers junior scholars with the
intellectual and practical resources they need to develop into successful independent investigators, including
junior faculty seminars, grant writing, editing, and review services, and opportunities for intellectual exchange
and collaboration with senior colleagues. An administrative supplement to my K01 award will provide me with

Lewy bodies are aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein (𝛼-Syn), that are seen in dementia-related diseases
such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While the central nervous system (CNS) has been the primary focus
of research, an increasing body of evidence suggest peripheral involvement, including that of the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract. Recent experiments in rodents and primates have shown gut-to-brain transmission of α-Syn,
consistent with clinical observations of GI symptoms in patients manifesting decades before motor and
behavioral alterations. This proposal pioneers the use of hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging (HP-MRI)
as a ‘brain scan’ for early detection of disease, and to assess new therapeutic interventions such as physical
activity.
HP-MRI is unique in its ability to detect metabolic flux. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that gut-
to-brain spread of 𝛼-Syn results in metabolic changes, well before development of dementia-related symptoms.
We test this hypothesis in mouse models of synucleinopathy. In Aim 1, we directly inject 𝛼-Syn pre-formed fibrils
(PFF), that has been shown to traffic from the gut to the brain. We will use HP-MRI to measure alterations in
pyruvate metabolism, expecting to detect increased lactate and reduced bicarbonate as 𝛼-Syn aggregates form.
Aim 2 explores a related, but separate application of HP-MRI - which is to detect the efficacy of exercise
intervention. Physical activity has been extensively study as an intervention to delay cognitive disorders. Here,
we hypothesize that HP-MRI can measure a ‘normalization’ of brain metabolism after 𝛼-Syn injection in exercised
mice. We also provide a mechanistic explanation, hypothesizing the apelin, an exerkine released after physical
activity, promotes autophagy to reduce the burden of 𝛼-Syn aggregation. Together, this proposal delivers new
tools and methods, that are ultimately translatable to patients suffering from dementia-related diseases."

Individuals living with likely incurable cancer (ILLIC) are a heterogeneous, growing subpopulation of cancer
survivors who have unique survivorship care needs. Principal among these is the need for psychosocial
treatment. Treatment of depression is particularly critical as up to half of ILLIC report depressive symptoms, with
negative sequalae including lower quality of life, desire for hastened death, and suicidality. Numerous trials and
meta-analyses have documented that evidence-based psychosocial treatment improves depression outcomes
for ILLIC. However, multilevel barriers limit access. Thus, ILLIC need feasible, accessible depression treatment
options. Brief depression screeners are now routinely administered in oncology settings. These data can be used
to proactively identify survivors in need of psychosocial treatment. Efficient identification (ID) of ILLIC, though, is
more challenging. Data necessary to determine likelihood of curability are recorded in unstructured EHR fields,
necessitating labor-intensive, manual chart review to identify ILLIC. To realize the goal of proactive ID and
delivery of scalable depression care for ILLIC, accurate, efficient, automated ID approaches are needed. Self-
guided digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) can be paired with proactive ID to deliver scalable depression
treatment. Our team previously adapted one evidence-based depression treatment, Behavioral Activation, for
delivery via a DMHI called “Moodivate” and demonstrated that Moodivate is a feasible, acceptable, and
efficacious DMHI. Thus, a proactive treatment delivery model using a self-guided DMHI such as Moodivate may
be a promising approach to deliver evidence-based depression treatment to ILLIC. [[We have confirmed
feasibility and acceptability of this approach via a recent pilot trial in which we specifically tailored Moodivate to
the unique needs of ILLIC and tested all methods proposed herein.]] Importantly, a sustainable model must
address the chronic evidence-to-practice gap that limits psychosocial care delivery. Thus, implementation
outcomes and determinants must be concurrently evaluated. Directly aligned with RFA-CA-22-027, we propose
a Hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to: 1) comprehensively assess the effectiveness of a proactive
ID + DMHI approach among ILLIC, 2) gather information on intervention delivery to guide implementation best
practices, and 3) develop an EHR-derived phenotype of likely incurable cancer. Our diverse stakeholder advisory
board, which includes ILLIC, oncology providers, and organizational leaders, has guided and refined this
proposal to ensure its clinical relevance and will continue to partner with our team on all aspects of the study
design, implementation, and dissemination of study findings. This program of research has the potential to
expand evidence-based psychosocial treatment access in a manner that is scalable across oncology settings
and ultimately decrease the undue burden of depression shouldered by ILLIC."

 The Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI2R) pursues a mission of bringing people
together to create new ways of seeing. The work of our Center has been focused on creating new paradigms
for the acquisition, reconstruction, and interpretation of biomedical images, and on implementing new
collaboration models in order to translate these developments rapidly into clinical practice.
 The world of medical imaging is changing, and CAI2R has been at the forefront of that change. Tasks that
were once the sole domain of meticulously-engineered hardware are increasingly being accomplished in
software, aided by modern AI and informed by diverse arrays of inexpensive auxiliary sensors. The longstanding
conviction that “bigger is better” in imaging technology is being supplanted, or at least supplemented, by a new
“less is more” philosophy. It is a time of remarkable creative flux, with new technologies and new mathematical
transforms causing long-held assumptions about the daily practice of imaging to be called into question. In short,
imaging is in the process of being reimagined. Each of our three Technology Research and Development (TRD)
projects will advance this project of reinvention, introducing new enabling technologies & transforms:
1. Reimagining the Future of Scanning: Intelligent image acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis.
2. Unshackling the Scanners of the Future: From rigid control to flexible sensor-rich navigation.
3. Revealing Microstructure: Biophysical modeling and validation for discovery and clinical care.
 Having pioneered the use of machine learning for accelerated image reconstruction, and having introduced
new continuous comprehensive data acquisition methods, we will bring the two together for improved quantitative
imaging. Based on our experience with use of shared information across time in dynamic imaging, we will also
explore new ways to leverage prior information in longitudinal scanning over spans of months rather than
milliseconds. In place of our early technology test beds of ultra-high-field MRI and MR-PET, we will explore new
applications in low-field MRI and MR-guided radiotherapy. We will extend the “standard model” of microstructure
originally conceived by our team, developing newly efficient and information-rich diffusion MRI methods.
 Our Center has an explicit translational focus, which is reflected in the day-to-day operation of TRD projects
as well as in the topics of Collaborative Projects (CPs) and Service Projects (SPs), which are focused on three
general areas of high public health impact: cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and neurologic disease.
 In keeping with this translational emphasis, CAI2R is also be driven by an embedded collaboration model in
which basic scientists, clinicians, and industry developers sit down together regularly at the scanners for
interactive technology development and assessment. With early involvement of clinical stakeholders and
industry partners, we aim to make CAI2R technologies, software platforms, and datasets widely available, for the
advancement of biomedical knowledge and for the benefit of patients and the physicians who care for them."

Texas State University (TxSt) and its partner in this Bridge-to-the-Doctorate Program application, the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio; UTHSA), are both designated Hispanic-
Serving Institutions and actively support and promote various programs targeting students from historically
marginalized groups (HMGs). We are partnering for a new T32 institutional training grant, the Texas Doctoral
Bridge Program (TDBP), which aims to increase the diversity of the biomedical workforce by preparing and
recruiting outstanding M.S. students from TxSt for competitive and high quality biomedical Ph.D. programs, such
as that found at UTHSA. Over the last ten years, TxSt has established an excellent record in training biochemistry
M.S. students for doctoral programs. In particular, NIH support of these trainees through an R25 grant program
strongly impacted the Biochemistry M.S. program by reducing overall time-to-degree while simultaneously
increasing the proportion of students from HMGs (from ~20% to ~50%). More than 70% of the NIH-supported
trainees from this R25 program were bridged to doctoral degree programs with many completing the Ph.D. and
transitioning to postdoc positions or other careers of choice. This new T32 will support to up to 14 eligible students
per year, who are enrolled in thesis-based M.S. degree programs in departments across the College of Science
and Engineering at TxSt, to include biology, biochemistry, chemistry, mathematics, and computer science tracks.
Concurrently, this collaborative training program will foster a strong research and training relationship between
faculty at UTHSA and TxSt. We anticipate that inter-institutional rigorous research thesis projects that utilize the
scientific resources at UTHSA will enhance the capability of trainees from HMGs at TxSt to be competitive for,
gain admission into, and thrive within high quality research doctoral programs in biomedical science. Our
program objectives are to: 1) increase the diversity and inclusion of HM students in thesis-based, biomedical
M.S. degree programs at TxSt, 2) develop trainee skillsets to ensure the transition to Ph.D. programs and for
long-term professional success in biomedical research careers, and 3) mentor the mentors by building a
community of excellence for effective, rigorous, and culturally aware mentoring."

This administrative supplement aims to reduce unnecessary or inappropriate care in older adults with
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), using breast cancer over-screening as a case study.
Mammography screening may decrease breast cancer mortality and morbidity, but the potential benefits are
often delayed for many years while significant harms can occur in the short term. The harms of routine
screening outweigh the benefits among older women with limited life expectancies, but many of these women,
including those with AD/ADRD, continue to be screened.
 The parent project (R01AG066741) is studying the novel use of messaging interventions to reduce
over-screening in the general population but does not focus on older women with AD/ADRD. Breast cancer
screening decisions in AD/ADRD patients may differ in process (e.g., caregiver involvement), decisional
factors, and communication. We propose in this supplement to examine whether the messaging strategies
developed in the parent grant will be acceptable and effective for older women with AD/ADRD and their
caregivers. The supplement also builds upon the parent project to examine AD/ADRD patients and caregivers’
decision-making about stopping breast cancer screening, which can serve as a case study to provide key
insights on the de-implementation of other unnecessary or inappropriate preventive care where short-term
harms outweigh delayed benefits.
 We propose to examine the perspectives of older women with AD/ADRD and their caregivers, including
how they make breast cancer screening decisions and consider de-implementation, and feedback on the
messaging strategies for reducing breast cancer over-screening from the parent project. We will conduct
qualitative interviews of 15-20 older women with AD/ADRD and 15-20 caregivers (Aim 1) and quantitative
survey of 400 caregivers for older women with AD/ADRD recruited from a nationally representative online
panel (Aim 2). Lastly, we will leverage stakeholder engagement that is already planned in the parent project for
devising messaging strategies. We propose to add stakeholders relevant to AD/ADRD patients and to expand
discussion to de-implementation of breast cancer over-screening in patients with AD/ADRD.
 The proposed supplement will 1) enhance the parent project by ensuring that the developed messaging
strategies are applicable to older women with AD/ADRD, and 2) provide key preliminary data on other
intervention approaches for de-implementing breast cancer over-screening and other unnecessary or
inappropriate care in older adults with AD/ADRD."

There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that target events that precede
the loss of synaptic connectivity and cognitive decline. The cytoskeleton of neurons plays a crucial role in the
development and maintenance of synaptic connections and dysregulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton is highly
implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the order of early pathological events that drive cytotoxicity
and neurodegeneration remain poorly understood. We recently discovered that depleting F-actin or inhibiting
nonmuscle myosin 2 in neuronal processes caused dramatic changes to the microtubule cytoskeleton and
dysregulated the transport of organelles in neuronal processes. This study revealed that disruption of actomyosin
can cause neurodegenerative disease-linked phenotypes which have not been attributed to the actin
cytoskeleton. Additionally, alterations to microtubules were completely reversed if actomyosin function was
restored, indicating that the actin cytoskeleton is potentially a target to control microtubule-based processes and
restore axonal defects. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that dysregulation of actomyosin is an
early event in AD that primes axons for degeneration and modifying its activity can mitigate AD-related pathology.
The goal of this administrative supplement is to perform pilot studies to determine if neurons from Alzheimer’s
disease mouse models have actomyosin defects and if they appear in an age-dependent manner. We will also
modulate F-actin and myosin activity to investigate if the development of dystrophic neurites and axonal
fragmentation caused by the application of Aβ oligomers can be reduced. This project, which is a natural
extension of current work in the lab, will create a better understanding of the cellular events that cause AD and
potentially identify new targets for therapeutic intervention."

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play critical roles in all aspects of RNA metabolism, with significant implications in
physiological and pathological settings. A crucial factor in these processes is the exact location of these
RBP:RNA interactions within the cell. These interactions are pivotal when cells adapt to stress and are often
dysregulated in disease. Our current tools fall short in identifying RBP targets with subcellular resolution. This
proposal introduces a groundbreaking approach to bridge this knowledge gap. We aim to develop and apply
innovative tools designed to capture subcellular information for individual RBP:RNA binding events at a systems
scale within living cells. Using cellular models that mimic halted protein synthesis, we aim to build a
comprehensive spatial map of RBP:RNA interactions, shedding light on the remodeling of these networks during
changes in post-transcriptional and translational control. At the level of individual RBPs, we will explore the
temporal sequence of events by which specific RBPs regulate the localization, stability, and translation of their
target RNAs, especially during stress-induced relocalizations. Using cutting-edge proximity labeling and isolation
techniques, we will map RBP targets across subcellular space and integrate them within the broader landscape
of cellular RNA networks and interactions. These data will be analyzed using state-of-the-art computational
approaches and integrated with other high-throughput datasets such as Riboseq and RNAseq. This integrative
analysis will enable us to construct and iteratively test predictive models of RBP activity based on their spatial
distribution. Building off of this, we will apply these innovative methods to discern RBP:RNA regulatory programs
in difficult to isolate membrane-less organelles, using static and oscillating mammalian stress granules (SGs) as
our investigative platform. Overall, this proposal lays the foundation for an advanced understanding of RBP
models that incorporate subcellular location as a critical determinant of their functions. Our comprehensive
approach, bridging experimental and computational analyses, promises to uncover novel mechanisms of RBP
action during changing cell states, providing insights that may guide future therapeutic strategies against an
array of RBP-associated diseases that impact human health."
10937803,"ABSTRACT
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a pivotal role in maintaining protein homeostasis by implementing
crucial quality control mechanisms. Newly synthesized polypeptides that fail to fold correctly, are directed for
degradation by the proteasome through ER-associated degradation (ERAD) or transported to the lysosome for
degradation via autophagic processes known as ER-autophagy (ER-phagy). Although ERAD and ER-phagy
share common features, these pathways function independently to recognize and degrade substrates. Despite
the critical role of ER quality control, there are gaps in our understanding of this process including a) how
damaged proteins are directed into specific proteostasis pathways and b) the role of cell-type specific
proteostasis adaptations. To address these gaps, the overall objective of this application is to understand how
ER quality control is regulated in different cell types. Here we outline three goals (1) Establish the principles
governing the selection of targets by the ERAD and ER-phagy system; (2) Define how glycan site occupancy
regulates the selection of ER quality control pathways; (3) Understand the cell-type specific roles of ER-phagy
receptors. We previously found that a disease-causing mutation in the NPC1 protein, an isoleucine-to-
threonine substitution mutant at position 1061 (I1061T), is rapidly cleared from the ER by both ERAD and ER-
phagy, making I1061T-NPC1 an excellent substrate to study this selection process. Additionally, we found that
differences in glycan site occupancy between species alter NPC1 ER degradation. To accomplish the goals,
we will leverage our recently developed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) expressing dCas9, and/or
NPC1 variants: WT-NPC1, I1061T-NPC1, or NPC1-null. This isogenic cell system enables the differentiation of
iPSCs into hepatocytes or excitatory neurons and modulation of cell type-specific proteostasis through small
molecules or by stably reducing specific gene products using dCas9. In goal (1) we will use small molecule
inhibitors and dCAS9 to study the role of glycan structures in ERAD and ER-phagy pathway selection. Goal (2)
involves introducing human and mouse NPC1 glycan mutants into NPC1-null iPSCs using lentivirus. These
cells will be differentiated into neurons and hepatocytes to study the role of glycan sites in NPC1 degradation
using biochemical methods. Lastly, in goal (3) we will use dCas9 to stably reduce the expression of a panel of
ER-phagy receptors in iPSC derived neurons and hepatocytes. Then we will leverage LC-MS/MS and
biochemical methods to study their role in regulating the cell-type specific proteome. The rationale for this
project is that understanding the recognition and evasion processes in ER quality control has significant
implications for many human disorders, including Cystic Fibrosis (CFTR), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (ATZ),
and Gaucher disease (GCase). These insights could potentially lead to novel treatments for these conditions."

Kidney-risk variants (KRVs) in the apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) are present only in African-derived populations, including African Americans. More than 30% of cases of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in African Americans are attributable to these variants. APOL1 KRVs also contribute to the more rapid failure of transplanted kidneys from African American deceased donors. However, only ~20% of those with APOL1 high-risk genotypes develop ESKD, and only a similar portion of transplanted kidneys from deceased donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes fail rapidly. Hence, modifiers (inherited or environmental second hits) likely impact development of kidney disease in individuals and donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes. The APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes Network (APOLLO) is an NIH-funded national prospective study of donor and recipient APOL1 genotype effects on transplantation outcomes. To optimize allocation of kidneys from deceased African American donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, we propose an ancillary study focused on critical questions not addressed in APOLLO. These include identification of APOL1 gene expression profiles in donor kidneys and factors modifying effects of APOL1 high-risk genotypes. The primary goal of this application is to reveal a clinically actionable approach to identify which kidneys are truly “high risk” among deceased donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes. We, and others, reported that overexpression of APOL1 KRV proteins induces cellular toxicity. Moreover, APOL1 KRVs cause cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. We propose to prospectively assess correlations between APOL1 protein abundance in kidney tissue and the main APOLLO study primary and secondary outcomes (i.e., time to allograft failure, long-term kidney function and proteinuria) – using kidney tissue from African American deceased donors studied at the time of transplantation. In addition, we will perform APOL1 mRNA (transcript) and global RNA sequencing analyses in kidneys to link transcripts in pathways that act in concert with APOL1 for associations with transplant outcomes. We will also perform single cell RNA sequencing to verify cell-specific genetic components that regulate APOL1 expression. Our state-of-the-art trans-omics approach integrates kidney-specific genetic and transcriptomic data and will infer component contributions to kidney transplant outcomes from African American deceased donors while accounting for recipient APOL1 genotype. Among donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes, we hypothesize that kidneys with higher levels of APOL1 KRV proteins at implantation will fail more rapidly, whereas those with lower levels will function longer, similar to donor kidneys with APOL1 low-risk genotypes. These results could lead to a rapid testing panel to optimize and transform kidney allocation of deceased donors with APOL1 high-risk genotypes. This work has the potential to shift current paradigms to optimize renal allograft survival, reduce the discard of good-quality kidneys, and increase numbers of kidney transplants, a critical need for patients with ESKD."

 Hence, the goals of the current proposal are to model lung cell immune dysfunction using HBEC (Aim
1). To assess immune cell involvement/recruitment and lung pathology post-vape exposure using our in vivo
model (Aim 2). We will then determine whether pre-exposure to e-liquid aerosol renders C57BL/6J mice more
susceptible to pulmonary distress/disease using Klebsiella pneumoniae as a pathogen challenge model (Aim
3). Completion of the proposed Aims will ultimately shed light on the possible health implications of new and
emerging tobacco products (such as E-cigs) and provide mechanistic detail on the possible initiation and
progression of lung disease in E-cig users."

Half of those living with HIV in the United States are over 50 years of age. As people living with 
HIV (PWH) live longer with the disease, the tradeoff is that they live with multiple comorbidities.
One of the more common comorbidities is depression. There is a need to find innovative and 
accessible nonpharmacological interventions that can help older people living with HIV/AIDS to 
manage depressive symptoms that may also affect their treatment outcomes. Tai chi/Qigong 
(TCQ) is a series of slow, low-impact meditative movements that integrate breath work, 
meditation, and stances; and may improve depressive symptoms. We propose testing the 
efficacy of a remotely delivered standardized TCQ intervention that has shown to be acceptable 
and feasible with a population of older people living with HIV/AIDS. Thus, this study proposes 
three aims: (i) to determine whether a remotely delivered TCQ intervention is directly efficacious 
in improving depressive symptoms compared to a health education control group among older 
PWH (50 years of age or older); (ii) to determine whether a remotely delivered TCQ intervention 
indirectly improves depressive symptoms via biological, psychological, and behavioral 
mechanisms compared to a health education control group among older PWH and (iii) to 
determine whether the direct and indirect associations between a TCQ intervention and 
depressive symptoms is moderated by gender among older PWH. Participants (n=326) will be 
recruited using social media sites (e.g., WebMD, google, Facebook) throughout the United 
States, and from at least two contact registries of older PWH. For the registries, research staff 
will contact participants via phone. All assessments will be conducted via Zoom 
videoconferencing or phone. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 conditions: the TCQ 
intervention, or a health education control group condition. Both the TCQ and the health 
education control condition will be delivered via Zoom to participants in the form of live, 
synchronous classes. We will assess the efficacy of TCQ by looking at instruments that 
measure depression; and potential mechanisms such as sleep, fatigue, emotional regulation, 
and heart variability at baseline, 3-month, and 9-month post-intervention. Blood will also be 
collected via Quest Diagnostics at baseline and at 9-month to collect viral load and an 
inflammatory marker (C-reactive protein). Data will be described using descriptive techniques. 
Efficacy of the TCQ treatment will be evaluated using a random effects analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model. We will follow the Baron & Kenny’s method for mediation analysis to assess 
if the effect of TCQ intervention on depressive symptoms is mediated by biological (heart 
variability, using HF power values expected to increase), psychological (emotional regulation, 
anxiety, stress), and behavioral (fatigue, sleep) variables."
10923236,"Project Abstract: Faithful epigenetic maintenance of repression is essential to developmental processes and
is frequently disrupted in diseases like cancer. Repression is maintained, in part, by chromatin-associated
proteins, like HP1 and Polycomb (Pc) groups that biochemically alter chromatin by depositing histone marks
and spatially reorganize chromatin by compaction and/or phase separation mechanisms. As such, a physical
mechanism of repression through stable compaction or phase separation of chromatin has been proposed as
the function of heterochromatin organization, resulting in discrete open (active) and closed (repressed)
chromatin states. My prior studies challenge this dogma by revealing that while Pc-repressed regions are
compact and separated on average, at the single-locus level there exists a continuum of repressed chromatin
conformations. I propose that instead of providing a physical mechanism of transcriptional repression,
heterochromatin indirectly represses chromatin by regulating epigenetic memory. A mechanism of spatial
feedback, through which dynamic chromatin folding permits distal loci to reinforce the deposition and
maintenance of histone marks, serves as an epigenetic memory regulator without the need for a stably
compact or phase-separated organization. In this model, the rates of interaction frequencies, facilitated by cell
type- or locus-specific HP1/Polycomb proteins, refresh epigenetic marks in the face of nucleosome turnover
and cell division. This dynamic chromatin organization can regulate stability of epigenetic memory such that a
balance between maintenance of the existing epigenetic state and reprogrammability scales with cell plasticity.
In this proposal I will rigorously investigate this functional feedback between 3D genome organization and the
repressive epigenetic memory that underlies developmental gene regulation and cell plasticity. In Aim 1, I will
evaluate how dynamic chromatin organization regulates epigenetic memory during development through a
highly multiplexed epigenetic state and chromatin imaging methodology. This will enable me to
analyze single-locus epigenetic states and chromatin folding in an organoid model, unveiling how spatial
feedback shapes cellular reprogramming and fate commitment. In Aim 2, I will perform live imaging of
 heterochromatin dynamics which will allow me to define the motion of HP1 and Pc-bound chromatin and
measure how chromatin motion influences epigenetic memory. Finally, I will develop a super-resolution
imaging methodology to quantify protein-DNA interactions and chromatin folding to better understand the role
of Pc associated proteins’ ability to alter chromatin organization and create different levels of chromatin spatial
feedback."

Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma (OCCC) is the second most common type of ovarian cancer and is associated
with poor survival because of the lack of effective therapeutic options. Our long-term goal is to understand the
molecular mechanisms that create therapeutic opportunities in OCCC and to translate such discoveries into
meaningful clinical applications.
ARID1A, a component of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, is mutated in more than 50% of OCCC.
With the support of our current R01 project, we have established a successful research program to study the
role of the ARID1A-SWI/SNF complex in regulating the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. In the
preliminary studies leading to this renewal application, we discovered a new role for the ARID1A-SWI/SNF
complex in transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin repetitive DNA sequences, namely satellite DNA
element (satDNA) in response to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage. We also showed that aberrant
IR-induced satRNA expression activates RNA-sensing innate immune response in ARID1A-deficient cells.
These exciting and promising findings have led us to hypothesize that ARID1A deficiency unleashes IR-
induced de-repression of heterochromatin repetitive satDNA sequences by impairing DNMT3A-mediated DNA
methylation and transcriptional silencing. This consequently activates the dsRNA-sensing RIG-1/MDA5
pathway, and provides the rationale to use ATM inhibitors to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy and
immunotherapy by selectively modulating nucleic acid-mediated innate immune response in ARID1A-deficient
tumors. We will employ multidisciplinary approaches, including molecular/biochemistry/cell biology-based
mechanistic studies, shRNA/CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic studies, bioinformatic analysis and preclinical
animal model-based translational studies, and analysis of OCCC patient samples to test this hypothesis.
Together, our proposed project will not only mechanistically advance our fundamental understanding of the
underlying biology of how the ARID1A-SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex maintains heterochromatin
transcriptional silencing to radiation-induced DNA damage, but will also develop new personalized immune-
based radiotherapy regimens tailored to the genetic contexts of tumors, such as ARID1A deficiency or more
broadly SWI/SNF-mutated cancers."

Lead (Pb) poisoning remains a global public health crisis and is responsible for 30% of the global burden of
idiopathic intellectual disability, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Exposure to lead during fetal
and early child development can have significant structural and functional effects on the brain and other organ
systems, and early symptoms of lead poisoning like neurological impairment and behavior disorders are hard to
identify. The CDC has declared that no level of Pb exposure is safe for children, yet the vast majority of newborns,
infants, and children in the US are not tested. A major limitation of current diagnostic testing for measuring blood
lead levels (BLL) is that it requires venous blood. Venipuncture is technically difficult to implement on infants,
and it is a frightening procedure for young children, which serve as an obstacle to Pb screening. This has led to
less than half of children under 6 years of age currently being tested for Pb exposures in the US. As a result,
there is a critical unmet need for new approaches to Pb screening in early life to identify at-risk individuals and
inform remediation efforts to remove or reduce Pb exposures during critical stages of human development. In
this Phase I STTR application we will optimize and validate a metals-free dried blood spot (DBS) collection
device to accurately quantify low BLLs in a single drop of capillary blood collected on filter paper. Our approach
features the following innovative and patented technology: (1) A process to remove Pb contamination from filter
paper before blood is collected, (2) A device to protect the filter paper from environmental Pb contamination
before, during, after blood collection, and (3) The use of discs of filter paper with known blood saturation volumes
to allow for accurately and precisely blood volume estimates, while simplifying blood extraction procedures in
the laboratory. Our approach combines the low cost and burden of capillary blood sampling with rigorous
quantification of BLLs in the lab. Successful completion of these study aims will result in a simple, low-cost, and
minimally-invasive blood collection device that can quantify BLLs with precision and detection limits similar to
gold standard venipuncture methods. This will provide new market opportunities to expand Pb testing in
newborn, infant, and children populations."

600,000 people in the US rely on intermittent catheterization (IC) for bladder emptying,
but current IC products not adequately meet users’ needs. CathBuddy, Inc. has
developed a novel IC system that is safely reusable, with an automated, validated
method to clean, disinfect and lubricate catheters for re-use. The objective of this SBIR
Phase II project is to modify the design of the 16” Aurie Reusable Catheter System
(developed first due to increased technical difficulty and use by both male and female
IC users) to a 6” system (preferable for many female IC users and needed to enhance
widespread appeal and recruitment for clinical studies). Patients with neurogenic
bladder (NB) are often unable to void spontaneously and require self-administered IC
multiple times each day. Current guidelines recommend the use of a new single-use
catheter with each catheterization, a practice adopted to reduce infection risk, although
IC still contributes to a 50% annual complicated urinary tract infection risk. No-touch
catheters reduce this infection risk by 44.5% with features including introducer tips and
insertion sleeves that reduce the likelihood of contact contamination, but they are often
prohibitively expensive on a per-use basis and only 5% of the user population can
access them. These factors have led to CathBuddy, Inc.’s development of a safely
reusable no-touch urinary catheterization system that alleviates many of the
documented obstacles in IC with a specific focus on human factors and ease-of-use
through a no-touch design. By incorporating a personal portable washer-disinfecting
carrying case for use by the individual into this novel catheterization system, the notouch
catheters can be safely reused on-the-go, and per-use costs drop dramatically. In
addition, plastic waste from catheterization can be reduced by up to 85%. In this Phase
II project, 1) the existing 16” system will be modified to incorporate 6” catheterspecific
design requirements. Modification of the 16” system will require first
evaluating the decrease in fluid volume requirements between the two catheter lengths;
this will be translated into smaller supply needs, smaller batteries (for onboard pumps),
and a smaller overall footprint. This effort will culminate in the development of an
alpha prototype of the female system that can be used in future efforts for FDArequired
Verification and Validation testing."

YoungHeartValve (YHV), Inc. is commercializing the Rejuvenate™ Heart Valve, a balloon-expandable,
stented, transcatheter aortic heart valve (TAVR) with hyaluronan-impregnated polymeric, flexible leaflets that will
obviate the need for chronic anti-coagulation and prevent calcification while simultaneously rivaling the longevity
of surgically placed mechanical valves. Unique and novel Dynamic Sealing Technology (DST) that activates
once implanted will form fit the valve to provide for a more complete and reliable annular seal, rivaling that of
sutured-in-place surgical valves. Further, YHV’s “no tissue / no farm” manufacturing automation and supply
chain will significantly reduce the cost and complexity of today’s pericardial based TAVR systems, thereby
opening up possibilities for this life-saving technology to truly be adopted worldwide. Aim 1 will verify Valve 2.0
design meets all ISO Standards and begin manufacturing for scale up. Aim 2 will complete acute and chronic
animal testing to achieve design freeze (Valve 3.0). This SBIR Phase II grant will help YHV emerge from the
“Valley of Death” commonly faced by start-ups. The Rejuvenate™ Valve will be ready for GLP pre-clinical
testing and “first-in-human” testing. YHV will have the supply-chain, manufacturing, and distribution relationships
required for commercialization, will have raised “Series A” funding in parallel with Phase II funding and have a

 This proposal outlines a five-year career development program for Caleb Lareau, Ph.D. to prepare him
for an independent research career in human genomics to study cellular processes underlying complex
disease. The candidate will conduct his postdoctoral training at Stanford University, which provides an
outstanding environment to complete the proposed research and develop skills in massive-scale computational
analyses, genomics technology development, and immunology. Dr. Lareau’s mentors and advisors, including
Drs. Satpathy, Kundaje, Greenleaf, Howitt, Curtis, and Anderson, have diverse technical expertise relevant to
all aspects of the proposal and track records of guiding trainees to independence. Further, the candidate will
utilize world-class resources available through the Stanford School of Medicine, Office of Postdoctoral Affairs,
and NHGRI-funded Centers at Stanford to acquire career development skills while interfacing with leaders in
genomics. Additionally, the research infrastructure within his mentors’ labs will enable him to efficiently perform
the scientific aims, receive training in areas encompassed by this proposal, and transition to independence.
 The goal of this work is to develop single-cell genomics methods to chart somatic evolution throughout
the human body. Evidence from recent bulk sequencing studies has indicated that somatic evolution occurs in
almost all tissues, but current approaches lack sensitivity to resolve clonal expansions, associated cell states,
or their prevalence throughout the body. A key bottleneck in studying somatic evolution has been limitations of
genomics technologies, which if addressed, may lead to insights into the pathogenesis of diseases like cancer.
 In Aim 1 (K99), the candidate will establish a new single-cell approach for measuring accessible
chromatin, protein abundance, and mitochondrial DNA mutations to identify clonal expansions and related cell
state changes. In Aim 2 (K99), the candidate will apply multi-omics technologies to identify the origins and
expansions of macrophages within human gynecological tissues and tumors. After transitioning to a faculty
position for Aim 3 (R00), the candidate will focus his effort on creating massive-scale single-cell whole-genome
sequencing methods that are paired with functional measurements, including RNA or protein quantification. All
Aims will utilize and build upon cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics technologies to study somatic evolution.
 Together, the pursuit of this research will result in tools and insights that will directly inform properties of
human tissue physiology and aid in the early detection, characterization, and understanding of age-associated
diseases, including cancer. All protocols, data, analytical frameworks, and software tools that are produced
during the duration of this research will be freely distributed. In total, the proposal will lead to novel insights into
the molecular signatures and regulation of somatic evolution and serve as an effective training program for Dr.
Lareau to launch his independent career as a tenure-track investigator."
10933008,"Project Abstract
The main objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms of YAP1-mediated metastatic niche and
immunosuppression in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) for novel therapeutic
discoveries. GAC is a major health burden in the US and worldwide. PC is common affecting ~45% of GAC
patients. GAC patients with PC have short survival and treatments are ineffective. Molecular understanding for
PC is limited. To address this unmet clinical challenge, we have established PC banking infrastructure aiming to
utilize these patient-derived specimens to discover and validate our novel targets. Our preliminary RNAseq
profiling of PC specimens revealed an enrichment of unique immune suppressive molecules, including TIM3 and
it’s ligand Galectin-9 (Gal-9), TGF-β and VISTA, but less expression of PD-1/PDL-1 and CTLA-4. YAP1 has
been implicated in human development, lineage plasticity, and upregulated in many tumor types. However, its
role in mediating PC metastases and immune suppression in tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unclear.
Our preliminary data suggest that YAP1 is highly expressed in primary and metastatic tumor cells of GAC
patients and is significantly associated with poor survival. Genetic knockout (KO) YAP1 significantly decreased
cancer stemness traits, tumor formation and PC in mice. Further, depletion of YAP1 in tumor cells consistently
increased CD3 and CD8 T cell responses from GAC. Through a single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) of PC samples
and validation using immunofluorescent staining, we noticed that YAP1, TIM3 ligand Gal-9 and DKK1 are highly
expressed in tumor cells of PC; while TIM3 is enriched in immune cells. RNAseq from YAP1high and YAP1 KO
patient-derived tumor cells revealed that Gal-9 and DKK1 were significantly decreased upon depletion of YAP1
and these factors are associated with poor survival of patients. We hypothesize that YAP1high PC cells are
metastasis-initiating cells that orchestrate a niche by conferring cancer stemness attributes to the tumor cells
and promote tumor immunosuppression through activating TIM3/Gal-9 axis and increasing paracrine of DKK1
in PC TME. Therefore, simultaneously targeting Hippo/YAP1 and immune checkpoint (TIM3/Gal-9) could be an
enhanced strategy. To test our hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Determine the functional
relevance of YAP1 in PC stemness and metastases in tumor cells using novel stem cell cloning technology and
PDX/PDO models in vivo. Aim 2. To investigate the mechanisms whereby YAP1 mediates immunosuppression
in TME of PC. Aim 3. Elucidating efficacy of inhibition of YAP1 alone or in combination with TIM3 inhibition using
the PDO models, KP-Luc2 syngeneic mouse model, GEMM, and ongoing YAP1 clinical trial. By utilizing patient-
derived PC cells, we will uncover functional importance of YAP1-mediated PC and elucidate the mechanisms by
which YAP1 mediated immunosuppression for novel therapeutic strategies. Upon completion of this study, we
will have a strong rationale for a novel combination that could overcome the shortcomings we experience in the
clinics today."
10934041,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT - ABSTRACT
Connecticut residents are diagnosed with approximately 21,622 cases of cancer each year. Yale Cancer Center
(YCC) is the state’s only comprehensive cancer center and provides high quality cancer care, clinical trial access,
and cancer knowledge and tools for prevention and early detection to all 3.6 million CT residents within a 60-minute
drive. State cancer incidence rates are higher than national incidence rates and overall cancer burden is shaped by
structural and social factors—beyond individual level risk factors—such as income inequality, residential segrega-
tion, and differential utilization and availability of preventive care. YCC priority areas, influenced by catchment area
data and concerns, were selected to have the most impact on statewide cancer burden. The priority areas include
breast, liver, lung, and prostate cancers as well as cross-cutting themes of brain metastases, early onset cancers,
drug resistance, obesity and metabolism, and tobacco use. COE has also prioritized four micro-catchment popu-
lations—urban core areas, specific age groups (adults < 50 years & older adults), people who identify as Puerto
Rican, and Windham County—for outreach and engagement, based on sociodemographic and risk factor data,
and partners (established and emerging) capable of accelerating reach among these populations.
YCC’s Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) component uses relationships and data-driven approaches
to facilitate and advance equitable and catchment area-responsive research across the cancer care continuum. The
YCC COE vision is to deploy community outreach and engagement to ameliorate cancer burden within and beyond
YCC catchment area communities and to advance health equity. YCC COE advances this vision through four aims
focused on: 1) catchment area-driven discovery, 2) collaborations with YCC members to enrich research practice
and training relevant to catchment area populations including the diversification of cancer clinical trials, 3) elevating
community and patient voices within research and critical trust-building conversations that influence care, and 4)
disseminating scientific information and evidence-based practices to community organizations and catchment area
residents. COE aims are realized through four innovative signature programs developed through the infrastructure
and procedures established by COE. The four signature programs are: 1) Community Research Catalyst Program,
2) COE Liaisons Program, 3) Community Research Fellows (CRF), and 4) Community Champion Partnerships
(CCP). Signature programs have been organized within broader in-reach and outreach strategies to facilitate align-
ment of catchment area needs and YCC research priorities. The signature programs provide a focal activity within
each COE aim to facilitate catchment area-relevant research and bidirectional communications about catchment area
cancer burden and the potential benefits of YCC science to help address cancers in Connecticut. Selected impact
stories help illustrate the signature programs and early effects of COE investments on YCC research."
10934043,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT - PROJECT SUMMARY
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM). CPDM for Yale Cancer Center (YCC) is
accomplished through the Clinical Trials Office (CTO), which provides centralized services for conducting cancer
clinical trials and supporting 14 Clinical Research Teams (CRTs) extending across 16 YCC/Smilow Network
sites. The CTO encompasses all forms of CPDM support: protocol development, regulatory, enrollment, study
coordination, data management, Investigator-Initiated Trials, training, and quality management. The CTO serves
as the repository and reporting body for all clinical research protocols and data, supports all YCC clinical research
committees, and facilitates representative recruitment of subjects in the YCC Catchment Area. While the CTO
experienced destabilization due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering consequences, substantial
institutional support and commitment allowed the CTO to rebuild and recover. Accomplishments include 1) New
medical and executive leadership, 2) Expanded training and quality management, 3) Optimization of staffing and
reduction in staff turnover, 4) Enhanced organizational structure, 5) Improved workflows and processes and 6)
Improved time to activation. The effects of these improvements have positioned the CTO to increase capacity,
improve efficiency, and ensure sustainability in alignment with the Director’s vision and 2023 Strategic Plan. In
FY23, the CTO reported the recruitment of 1040 individuals into all clinical research studies conducted at YCC,
including 601 interventional treatment accruals, and has facilitated the activation of 99 studies.
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM). DSM is required for all interventional studies. YCC has an
established DSM Committee (DSMC), which performs risk-based data and safety monitoring to ensure patient
safety. Effective quality control functions provide the highest level of protocol compliance in accordance with
YCC’s NCI-approved DSM Plan. In FY23, the DSMC monitored 180 studies, which included the review of 29
audits, 76 progress reports, and all reported deviations and serious adverse events.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Clinical Research. YCC actively promotes the recruitment
of women and minorities. In FY23, 56% of adults accrued to YCC interventional treatment trials were women
and 20% were underrepresented ethnic and racial minorities; in both cases, these exceed the respective
proportions of YCC’s analytic cases and those of YCC’s Catchment Area.
Part IV: Inclusion of Individuals Across the Lifespan in Clinical Research. YCC supports the NIH policy
on the inclusion of individuals across the lifespan in research. The percentage of accruals to interventional
treatment studies for patients aged <18 increased over the project period (1.5% in FY18 to 2.2% in FY23).
Children (age <18) accounted for <1% of YCC analytic cases, and 2.2% of total accruals (interventional and non-
interventional) in FY23. The percentage of accruals to interventional treatment studies for patients aged 65+
increased over the project period (41% in 2018 to 46% in FY23)."
10934114,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD related disorders (ADRD) affect millions of people in the United States and
are major contributors to dementia worldwide. Since neuroinflammation plays an integral role in AD/ADRD, we
propose to expand our long-term NIA-funded research (R01 AG018859-19) to gain new knowledge about how
advanced age and the gut-brain axis trigger the decline in cognitive function using our well-established
clinically relevant murine model of cutaneous burn injury. Clinical and experimental evidence reveal that
healthy aged subjects are in an elevated basal inflammatory state, referred to as “inflamm-aging,” which can
contribute to deficits in tissue injury and repair. We, and others, believe that inflammaging is caused, in part, by
translocation of bacterial products from the intestinal lumen and that exposure to these products triggers the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF),
interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2). Recently published work from our lab
revealed that aged mice who sustain a scald burn injury have a greater breach in intestinal epithelial barrier
integrity than younger mice given the same injury. Additionally, we found that this heightened intestinal
response, and an alteration in the intestinal microbiome, both parallel a profound rise in inflammatory markers
in the brain. Both neuroinflammation and burn injury in the aged population have been correlated with
breaches in the blood brain barrier (BBB), delirium, and other signs of cognitive decline. From these
observations, we hypothesize that increased gut leakiness and altered intestinal microbiome in aged
mice after burn injury leads to heightened systemic inflammation and breach of the BBB, neuronal
damage, and cognitive decline. To test this, we propose to examine BBB dysfunction, neuroinflammation
and cognitive function in young and aged mice after burn injury by comparing the integrity of the BBB, the
presence of gut-derived bacteria/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the brain, as well as the systemic circulation, and
characterizing the activation of microglia and neuronal damage/death following injury. Moreover, we will
monitor cognitive function in young and aged mice both before and after burn injury to allow us to correlate
these behavioral tests with the aforementioned biomarkers of leakiness, inflammation, and neuronal damage.
These studies will expand our understanding of how advanced age alters the gut in the context of burn injury
and the impact of intestinal permeability on neuroinflammation, a hallmark of AD/ADRD. It is our hope that this
work will lead to the development of novel therapies to treat the excessive inflammatory response and
cognitive dysfunction seen in older patients suffering from traumatic injuries and a variety of other disorders."
10913460,"Abstract: 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the loss of memory accompanied by neuronal cell death and 
metabolic dysfunction. Numerous studies have reported a dysregulation in neuronal intracellular calcium 
(1Ca2+) signaling as an early event in AD pathogenesis. It is thought that a prolonged elevation in neuronal 1Ca2+ 
promotes excessive mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) uptake, yet to date no study has examined the contribution 
of mCa2+ uptake to disease progression. Since mCa2+ flux is an important regulator of cellular respiration and 
cell death, both of which are involved in AD pathogenesis, we hypothesize that mCa2+ overload is a key 
contributor to AD pathology and may contribute to metabolic deficits and neuronal demise. To define the role of 
mCa2+ exchange in AD we have generated 3xTg-AD mutant mice with neuronal-specific deletion of 
Mitochondrial Calcium Uniporter (MCU), which is required for mCa2+ uptake. In addition, we have generated a 
gain-of-function mutant mouse expressing the recently identified mitochondrial calcium uniporter beta subunit 
(MCUb). MCUb was recently reported as a negative regulator of mCa2+ uptake and we have observed 
substantial changes in its expression in AD. These models will allow causative experimentation to test if mCa2+ 
uptake drives AD progression. Mice will be examined for alterations in memory, amyloidosis, tau-pathology, 
oxidative stress, synaptic and metabolic function. Preliminary data suggest that mCa2+ uptake overload impairs 
the clearance of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional mitochondria. Therefore, we will mechanistically examine 
the link between mCa2+ exchange and autophagic and mitophagic pathways. Optimally, the proposed studies 
will discover new therapeutic targets for AD and associated mitochondrial dysfunction and provide a training 
and research platform to promote the Pis independent research career."

assess the implementation outcomes (acceptability, adaptation, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, penetrance, cost-
effectiveness, and sustainability) of the multifaceted strategy simultaneously. The RE-AIM framework has
guided the development and evaluation of the multifaceted implementation strategy, which includes CHW-led
health coaching on lifestyle changes and medication adherence; church-based exercise and weight loss
programs; self-monitoring of physical activity, blood pressure (BP), and glucose; and provider education and
engagement. The primary effectiveness outcome is the difference in the proportion of participants having ≥4
ideal or improved cardiovascular health metrics (CHMs), defined as a healthy diet score of 4-5 components or
increase of 2 components from baseline; 150 minutes/week moderate- or 75 minutes/week vigorous-intensity
physical activity or a combination; never smoking or quitting ≥6 months ago; body mass index <25 kg/m2 or
weight loss ≥10 pounds; A1c <7.0% (or <8.0% with complications); use of statin therapy as appropriate; and
BP <130/80 mmHg or systolic BP reduced by ≥10 mmHg. Our study has 90% statistical power to detect an
absolute difference of 15% in the primary effectiveness outcome at 18 months using a 2-sided significance
level of 0.05. In the planning phase, we will work with stakeholders to ensure the multifaceted implementation
strategy is responsive to African American community needs; we will identify 42 black churches as research
partners and conduct a health needs assessment; and we will develop the study protocol and obtain approval
from the NIH, DSMB, and IRB. In the implementation phase, we will recruit 1,050 African American participants
(25 per church) aged ≥40 years who have <4 ideal CHMs and randomly assign 21 churches to intervention
and 21 to control; we will implement the multifaceted intervention program; we will follow-up participants and
collect data on effectiveness and implementation outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 months; we will evaluate the
sustainability of the intervention in a 6-month post-intervention study; and we will perform intention-to-treat
analyses and disseminate and scale-up the proven-effective implementation strategy. The proposed study will
generate evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability of the multifaceted intervention
aimed at eliminating cardiovascular health disparities in high-burden populations in the US."

There is a lack of measures available for domains of importance to individuals and families

constructs and/or complex response formats (e.g. 7-point Likert-type or numerical scales) that
are not optimal for persons with dementia. Interdisciplinary researchers are engaging in
innovative, person-centered interventions grounded in therapeutic optimism but are constrained
by instruments that primarily quantify negative behaviors, deficit and decline, and/or by
measuring broad constructs such as global quality of life. The NIH-PROMIS measures
demonstrate the value of standardized, common datasets but they do not currently incorporate
patient preferences and may not encapsulate the full range of positive outcomes. Rigorous,
multi-site psychosocial intervention trials would benefit from a common portfolio of robust
measures sensitive to change that capture modifiable and meaningful aspects of living well with
dementia over time. This project will develop the infrastructure for development, standardization
and validation of new outcome measures and methods for psychosocial interventions in
dementia. Emphasis will be placed on measures that are clinically meaningful to persons living
with dementia as well as measures that capture modifiable elements of living well with
dementia. Measures that optimize longitudinal evaluation of psychosocial intervention for
persons with co-occurring cognitive and sensory challenges will be prioritized. In the R21 phase,
an interdisciplinary steering council comprised of persons living with dementia, researchers and
biostatisticians will convene focused expert panels and collaborate with an advisory board of
researchers and clinicians. Using the principles of human-centered design, the council will
identify priority outcome measures and create standards for design and testing of novel
measures, methods and technologies. In the R33 phase, prioritized measures and methods will
be pilot tested. These will include self-report, carer-informed and observational measures.
Products of this work will include: 1) Research guidelines for the development and testing of
new measures for psychosocial intervention research and 2) Promising new measures,
methods and technologies available for larger scale testing with the goal of adding to the NIH-
PROMIS measure set. The dissemination of these products will enhance the existing research
infrastructure and accelerate progress in psychosocial intervention research."

Regulatory changes made during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) that relaxed criteria for take-
home dosing (THD) of methadone offer an opportunity to improve retention in care with a lifesaving treatment.
Methadone is a highly effective medication for treating opioid use disorders (OUD) that is provided in opioid
treatment programs (OTPs). Yet, longstanding regulatory restrictions limit the availability of methadone as well
as create demands that heavily burden clients by requiring frequent visits to clinics. The rationale for these
regulations is to safeguard against diversion and overdoses from methadone. Yet, the history and application
of methadone regulations stem from stigmatized and racist notions of people with OUD. Most OTPs are
located within communities with predominantly Black/African American or Latinx populations. Consequently,
Black/African American and Latinx individuals have greater access to methadone than other, less restricted,
medications for OUD. Within OTPs, Black/African American and Latinx individuals are less likely to receive
adequate dosing levels of methadone and have lower retention than non-Hispanic White clients. More flexible
THD may help address disparities in care. Currently, there is a national debate about balancing safety
concerns over more flexible THD against the benefits of client retention and quality of life. Low offering of THD
in many OTPs suggests a need for new data-driven interventions to encourage changes in engrained clinical
workflows and long-standing stigmatizing beliefs about OUD clients. OTP leadership and staff express concern
about misapplying regulatory flexibility, of iatrogenic effects of greater THD, and about legal liability from
overdoses or diversion. Finally, financial concerns mount for organizations that have long based their business
models on billing for frequent in-person medication dispensing. This project stems from a well-established
academic-public partnership in New York State between the Office of Addiction Services and Supports
(OASAS) and research collaborators from New York University, Cornell University, and the University of
Connecticut. We propose a two-phased project to develop then test a multidimensional OTP intervention to
address clinical decision making, regulatory confusion, legal liability concerns, capacity for clinical practice
change, and financial barriers to THD. The intervention will include OTP THD specific dashboards drawn from
multiple State databases. The approach will be informed by the Health Equity Implementation Framework. In
phase 1 (R61), we will employ an explanatory sequential mixed method design to combine analysis of large
state administrative databases—Medicaid, treatment registry, THD reporting—with qualitative interviews to
refine the intervention. In phase 2 (R33), we will conduct a stepped-wedge trial with 36 OTPs (~10,800
Medicaid clients/yr) randomized to 6 cohorts of a six-month long clinic-level intervention over three years. The
trial will test the effects of the intervention on 1) THD; 2) retention in care; and 3) adverse healthcare events.
We will specifically examine the effects of the intervention for Black/African American and Latinx clients."
10911134,"PROJECT 3: ABSTRACT
FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) have emerged as the first-line treatment for patients
with metastatic pancreatic cancer (PDAC). These two regimens have not been compared in the first-line
setting, and treatment selection is guided by physician choice. Among patients with metastatic PDAC who do
not respond to first-line FOLFIRINOX, a substantial proportion will have a robust response to second-line GnP.
This strongly suggests that there may be a subset of patients who may have significant clinical response to
GnP but not FOLFIRINOX. Matching patients to the most effective first-line therapy is a critical and unmet
need.
We have identified molecular subtypes of PDAC that are robust and replicable. Analysis from two clinical trials
has shown that the basal subtype does not respond to FOLFIRINOX-based therapies and emphasizes the
critical need to identify alternative treatments. Recent results have shown that patients with basal tumors are
more responsive to GnP compared to FOLFIRINOX. Based on our findings of subtype associated treatment
response, we developed a robust and replicable single-sample classifier (PurIST) that is now a CLIA-approved
assay, and will be used this proposal to prospectively evaluate whether the PurIST classifier can be used to
direct treatment selection.
Leveraging the strength of molecular subtyping expertise at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
the tremendous clinical infrastructure at the Medical College of Wisconsin’s Pancreatic Cancer Program, we
propose a clinical trial where PurIST subtyping will be used to direct the initial chemotherapy. To our
knowledge this will be the first trial to use molecular subtyping to direct treatment in the neoadjuvant setting.
Results from this trial will demonstrate if precision oncology approaches such as PurIST may help direct
treatment and improve outcome for patients that may otherwise be less responsive to either FOLFIRINOX or
GnP.
In parallel, we will determine if specific characteristics in the tumor and tumor microenvironment may predict
response to different therapies through innovative computational approaches of cutting edge trials. Finally,
through our novel proteomic approaches we have found that basal tumors have differential kinase profiles. We
show that effectiveness of kinases inhibitors in PDAC may have been overlooked as ~20% of PDAC patients
are basal, and that subtype-specific kinases may be promising targets."

10911141,"CAREER ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The primary objective of the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) of the UNC Pancreas SPORE is to augment
the career development of a diverse group of faculty members who will focus on pancreatic cancer research.
This will be accomplished by 1) providing financial support to develop and enhance the research effort of these
faculty and 2) to provide both clinical and laboratory mentoring for investigators who are new to the field. We
intend to foster the research careers of translational investigators working in pancreatic cancer. The CEP will
select investigators for support from the entire spectrum of translational research in pancreatic cancer; including
those working in public health areas of prevention and early detection, diagnosis and other pertinent areas of
population science; basic science investigators working to translate their findings to patient care in the clinic and
translational/clinical investigators working to improve the outcome for patients with pancreatic cancer. We will
support highly qualified investigators who are new to the field of pancreatic cancer with a focus on early career
or mid-career investigators transitioning to work in this area.
The CEP is led by Jonathan Serody MD Associate Director for Translational Science at the Lineberger
Comprehensive Cancer Center and Elizabeth Thomas Professor of Medicine, Microbiology and Immunology.
The co-leaders are supported by the CEP Advisory Committee (CEPAC) that is chaired by the co-leaders and
includes Melissa Troester, PhD (Population Sciences), Anne Menkens, PhD (Administration), Antonio Baines
PhD (CEP Minority Advisor, NCCU), Albert Baldwin, PhD (Director DRP), and Andrea Hayes-Jordan (Pediatric
Surgery) and our patient advocates. Applicants will be selected from the highly qualified pool of investigators at
the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and North Carolina Central University an Historic Black College and
University in Durham NC which has a strong scientific relationship with the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer
Center and has a large African American and Latino population of students and postdoctoral fellows. Recruitment
of underrepresented minorities, disabled individuals, and women to pancreatic research will be emphasized and
will be the focus of Dr. Baines’s efforts on the CEPAC.
Financial support will be for an initial period of one year, that will be renewable if there has been appropriate
translational progress. We will collaborate with our partner institutions to strengthen multi-institutional
collaborations as the CEP matures."

Center to create the “Harvard/Stanford GTN”. The GTN study plan features three Projects an 
Administrative Core, a Pharmacological and Genomic Imaging Core and a proposed Network 
Coordinating Center (NCC). The Administrative Core will be based at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the 
parent organization for the Harvard/Stanford GTN, and will serve as the coordinating center and hub for the 
four institutions comprising the program and all interactions with existing P30-supported resources for clinical 
trials. The core will coordinate internal and external components of this complex structure to foster and support 
multi-project, inter-disciplinary, and inter-institutional drug development research in adult glioblastoma. Core 
personnel include one GTN Principal Investigator, three Site Leads at the Harvard/Stanford GTN institutions, 
two scientific co-administrators, a program coordinator, two grants specialists, and an administrative assistant. 
There are five Specific Aims in the Administrative Core. In the First Aim, the core will develop and engage a 
multidisciplinary Internal Advisory Board to provide critical oversight of the overall Harvard/Stanford GTN 
program. In the Second Aim, the core will organize regular meetings of key stakeholders to foster 
collaboration, troubleshooting, and monitoring of progress. In the Third and Fourth Aims, the core will maintain 
a trans-institutional program for regular, internal and external electronic communication among 
Harvard/Stanford project and core co-leads, clinical trialists, the GTN Steering Committee, the NCC, NCI 
program officials, and industry partners. In the Fifth Aim, the core will engage with institutional leaders at 
Harvard and Stanford to promote diversity and inclusion throughout the Harvard/Stanford GTN program. The 
Administrative Core Leader, Tracy Batchelor, M.D., will serve as the overall Principal Investigator of the 
Harvard/Stanford GTN program with able assistance from Site Leads at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Patrick 
Wen, M.D.), Massachusetts General Hospital (Isabel Arrillaga, M.D., Ph.D.), and Stanford University (Michelle

10911202,"Pathology Core (Core B) Project Summary/Abstract
The Molecular Pathology and Tissue Resources Core will provide routine and innovative tissue resources and
materials essential for achieving the aims of the SPORE projects. Routine materials include tumors, non-
malignant lung specimens, tumor cell lines, and clinical annotation, all of which have been obtained with informed
consent and measures to ensure patient confidentiality. Over 6,000 tumors including tumors on clinically
annotated tissue microarrays (TMAs), 300 lung cancer cell lines of all histologic types, and over 180 lung tumor
patient-derived and circulating tumor cell-derived xenografts (PDXs/CDXs) are available to investigators. Many
of these samples have been distributed to our SPORE investigators, as well as other investigators at our own
and outside institutions (including other SPOREs). These partnerships have fueled multiple lung cancer
translational research collaborations, and have generated over 380 publications in the last ten years. In addition
to important clinical and histologic annotation, the genomic, molecular, and immune microenvironment profiling
of these samples provide important Human Endpoints for correlative data and synergy, both within the UT Lung
SPORE and as components of other lung cancer translational research. Given the increasing importance of
immunotherapy for lung cancer, the Pathology Core has developed methods to provide state of the art immune
profiling annotation. Additionally, the Core has participated in collection of patient samples from the MDACC
ImmunogenomiC prOfiling of NSCLC (ICON) and NEOadjuvant STudy of induction checkpoint blockade for
Resectable stage I-IIIA NSCLC (NEOSTAR) clinical trials. Our Aim 1 is to collect, process, store, catalog and
distribute tissues, cell lines and blood specimens, both malignant and non- malignant, tumor xenografts, and
relevant clinico-pathologic and molecular data, as requested by the various component projects of the SPORE
program; we will use IRB-approved protocols, informed consent, and measures to protect subject confidentiality.
Aim 2 is to develop and utilize innovative and routine tissue and cell line resources that will aid in the successful
completion of the SPORE program aims; these include development of new tumor cell lines, additional lung
cancer TMA resources, molecular analysis of tumors and liquid biopsy, and comprehensive immune profiling of
tissues. Aim 3 is to perform, interpret, analyze, and deposit tissue-based molecular and immune analysis
methodologies in close collaboration with the component Projects, DRP, CEP, and Data Sciences Core of the
SPORE program to achieve their approved aims. Within these aims, the Pathology Core will play a crucial role
in promoting vertical and horizontal collaborations among our own SPORE investigators, investigators at other
Lung Cancer SPORE sites, and other investigators at our own and other institutions. All of our SPORE projects
will use Core B materials and services. Heavy utilization of our routine and innovative materials, as well as close
interactions with the SPORE investigators, will greatly aid the successful completion of the aims of our SPORE

10934596,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Many researches have indicated the prevalence and important functions of repetitive genes and gene isoforms,
especially on stem cell biology and developmental biology. While the development of the existing techniques to
characterize transcriptome based on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), has dramatically accelerated the
research of different transcriptomic events and has led to many important biological findings, the abundance
estimation of repetitive genes and genes isoforms remain a challenging problem. Hence, many downstream
quantitative analyses, such as differential expression analysis and network construction are hindered by this
limit. As the new long-read techniques have been optimized to convey robust sequencing data of transcriptome
with more unambiguous alignment, it brings in new discernible information that is useful for addressing certain
challenging but important transcriptomic problems. Our objective is to develop a series of bioinformatics
methods to perform more reliable quantitative and function analyses of repetitive genes and gene isoforms,
including abundance estimation, network construction and function prediction. Aim 1 is to identify quantification
errors and the incorrectly quantified genes and gene isoforms. Aim 2 is to solve the problem of quantification
by data integration. Aim 3 is to construct gene isoform network and find the possible isoform-specific functions
by network analysis. The methods will be applied to study the expression and function of repetitive genes and
gene isoforms in human stem cells and differentiations in Aim 4. These studies are anticipated to provide the
first bioinformatics platform for improve our understanding of repetitive genes and gene isoforms with complex
biomedical context in a comprehensive manner."

While Botswana has attained the UNAIDS 95-95-95 target for HIV treatment and is the first country with
severe HIV epidemic to reach the milestone of elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission, the country
failed to achieve the national target of zero new HIV infections by 2016 and is equally unlikely to achieve
the UNAIDS target of zero HIV infection in Botswana by 2030. In 2021 alone, Botswana registered ~6,700
new HIV infections. The initial Botswana PrEP strategy focused on key populations (KP) including
adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) with primarily HIV clinic based PrEP dispensing, and the
general heterosexual population was not prioritized. In Botswana and the region, barriers to PrEP uptake
or persistence include competing needs, mobility, poor knowledge about PrEP, limited social support for
PrEP users, among others. New strategies to remove barriers related to PrEP knowledge, access, and
uptake are urgently needed because there are individuals at substantial risk for HIV even in low incidence
settings. Thus, in the proposed research, we will develop and test new strategies that target a younger,
mobile, heterosexual and digitally connected population with high rates of sexual concurrency. Our
proposed study will leverage a successful national ART program and infrastructure to first develop and
pilot a PrEP implementation strategy for the general population. The program will be developed in
collaboration with policy makers, healthcare providers, community leaders, information & communications
service providers and adults between 18 and 49 years old in Botswana. It is intended to be delivered in-
person and also using information and communications technology such as cellular, video or WhatsApp.
Following the pilot, we will then use the new implementation strategy to conduct a type 3 hybrid multi-
component cluster randomized trial to optimize evidence-based implementation (EBI) uptake and
improvement of PrEP."

The overall goal of the Bridges to Baccalaureate Research Training Program at University of Memphis is to
prepare a diverse group of highly trained biomedical scientists to enhance the diversity of individuals entering
the biomedical research workforce. This proposed project will be a partnership program between the largest
community college and four-year institution serving southwest Tennessee, namely Southwest Tennessee
Community College (STCC) and The University of Memphis (UofM). The short-term goal of this Bridges
program is to enhance the knowledge, skills, values, identity, and self-efficacy as research scientists of STCC
students from underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences within a community of researchers. The
intermediate goal is to inspire matriculation and persistence in biomedical science-related undergraduate
programs at STCC, resulting in an increase in the number of students that transfer from STCC to UofM and
complete the baccalaureate degree in the biomedical sciences. The specific aims of this Bridges proposal are
to (1) admit at least 4 students per year from underrepresented groups in biomedical sciences-related degree
programs at STCC into the Bridges program, (2) retain at least 80% of Bridges students for successful
matriculation to UofM on a 3-year rolling basis, and (3) assist transferred Bridges students to persist to
bachelor’s degree completion each year. New training strategies as well as plans for expansion and/or
enhancement of existing training and educational programs at both STCC and UofM have been designed
within an inclusive and culturally responsive context to attain our goals. The training and educational programs
include curriculum enhancements for supplemental instruction at STCC, embedding Bridges trainees in a
STEM diversity peer mentoring program for undergraduate researchers at UofM, expanding continuous
research experiences at UofM, and expanding faculty research mentorship training at UofM. The expected
outcomes of this planned training program are to significantly the 5-year average number of STCC students
matriculating to UofM and who complete the baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline, as well as increasing
the number of STEM graduates in underrepresented groups who successfully matriculate into doctoral degree
programs in STEM disciplines and/or enter the biomedical research workforce."
10938639,"ABSTRACT
Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic is a global public health concern affecting over 100 million
people worldwide. Arguably the largest poisoned population in history, more than 57 million people in
Bangladesh are persistently exposed to arsenic by consuming contaminated water. The toxic effects
of exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water include numerous cancers and non-malignant
morbidities; however, variability in the presentation and severity of arsenic-induced diseases exists.
Inherited variation has been implicated in susceptibility to arsenic toxicity and the biological response
to arsenic exposure. Therefore, efforts to identify genetic determinants of arsenic metabolism
efficiency (AME), a key regulator of toxicity risk and outcomes, and susceptibility to arsenic toxicity
have been made in the field of genetic epidemiology. Although previous studies identified loci and
genetic variants associated with risk of AME and dermatological outcomes, none of these studies
focused exclusively on identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in non-coding RNA
regions of the genome associated with the aforementioned traits. For this reason, the main objective
of the proposed research is to identify functional variants in non-coding RNA genes associated with
susceptibility to arsenic toxicity and characterize their potential functional effects. The aims include
identifying SNPs in microRNA-encoding sequences and 3’UTR sequences of messenger RNAs that
disrupt microRNA-mRNA interactions, and that are associated with arsenic-induced skin lesion
development. Our research strategy includes leveraging existing data from the The Health Effects of
Arsenic Longitudinal Study cohort, a group of >8,000 Bangladeshi participants with varying levels of
exposure to arsenic-contaminated drinking water. The proposed project will advance our
understanding of genetic and environmental susceptibility to dermatological diseases, identify
potential therapeutic gene and pathway targets to treat arsenic toxicity, provide insights about
processes likely involved in the etiology of arsenic-induced diseases, and inform potential prevention
strategies. The goal of the training plan described in the proposal will cultivate expertise in molecular
and genetic epidemiology, and environmental health research, while preparing the trainee for an
academic research career focused on contributing meaningful knowledge regarding the understudied
focus on variants in functional, non-coding elements of the genome."
10939146,"PROJECT SUMMARY: MASS SPECTROMETRY & PROTEOMICS MODULE
 The Vanderbilt Vision Research Center (VVRC) includes investigators with a strong interest in
discerning how protein signatures govern functional circuits in the visual pathways and predispose patients
towards disease and response to treatment. These relationships require the ability to measure protein content
and patterns in large numbers of samples, transgenic animals, and even within highly localized intact tissues.
The purpose of the VVRC Mass Spectrometry & Proteomics Module is to provide a comprehensive
resource for all mass spectrometry needs for investigators needing proteomics, metabolomics, or tissue
imaging via mass spectrometry. This module provides access to state-of-the-art mass spectrometry,
proteomics, and mass spectrometry tissue imaging facilities via subsidized scholarship use of the Vanderbilt
Mass Spectrometry Research Center (MSRC). The MSRC comprises the Mass Spectrometry Core
Laboratory, the Proteomics Laboratory, and the Tissue Imaging Core, all with bioinformatic support through the
MSRC Bioinformatics Group. VVRC support translates on a dollar-for-dollar basis to scholarships issued to
VVRC investigators applicable for all MSRC services. This scholarship system is implemented by the VUMC
Office of Research and is utilized instead of a discount or co-pay via the VUMC ILab accounting system. In the
current funding cycle, the Proteomics Service Module was used by 12 investigators who authored 142
publications using the service, including 6 current NEI R01 holders. In the next cycle, we expect moderate to
extensive use by 22 of 52 VVRC faculty members, including 9 of 16 current NEI R01 grant holders. The Mass
Spectrometry & Proteomics Module, housed in a centralized location conveniently accessed from all parts of
campus, is directed by Professor Kevin Schey, PhD, who also directs a subset of the MSRC housed cores.
Using resources and personnel supported in part by this core grant, the VVRC Mass Spectrometry &
Proteomics Module will assist in (1) experimental design for proteomics, metabolomics, or imaging mass
spectrometry projects and (2) preparation of visual system tissues for mass spectrometry analysis and provide
(3) comprehensive proteomics service, (4) a range of small molecule and metabolomics services, (5) access
to imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) services, and (6) training to members of the vision research community in
LC-MS or IMS techniques. These services and resources will enhance the scope of experimentation NEI-
funded VVRC investigators conduct, expand the training of students and fellows involved in vision science, and
promote collaboration by providing sophisticated, high-resolution and high-throughput proteomics and
bioinformatic services to those who otherwise would not have such capabilities, including early-career vision
scientists and clinician-scientists competing for extramural funding for their laboratories."
10904560,"An excess of circulating lipids in conjunction with dysregulated retinal de novo lipogenesis results in retinal
lipotoxicity which can lead to retinal inflammation and apoptosis contributing to the pathogenesis of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). The nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR), shown to be diminished in human and mouse diabetic
retinas, is of particular interest for therapeutic intervention due to its binding and activation of PPAR and LXR
that regulate the expressions of lipid metabolism-associated and inflammation-related genes. Recently we
synthesized two small molecules, the RXR agonists (rexinoids) UAB30 and UAB126 which demonstrated
marked efficacy in reducing DR progression when given systemically; however these agents reduced
hyperglycemia and thus the beneficial effect of rexinoids on DR could be directly due to improvement in
diabetes management. In the proposed studies, we directed our efforts towards developing retinal delivery of
rexinoids to remove the confounding effect on glucose regulation and establish whether this targeted delivery
could beneficially impact retinal lipid metabolism and reduce retinal inflammation directly. Our overarching
hypothesis is that intravitreal (IVT) delivery of rexinoids as sustainable released microparticles (UAB126-MP
and UAB30-MP) will activate RXR, provide a long-term therapy for DR, and enhance the pool of RXR
homodimers available to partner with the PPARs and LXRs to both prevent and reverse DR. Therefore, we
propose that rexinoids act through the stabilization of the RXR/PPAR and RXR/LXR complexes leading to the
normalization of lipid metabolism and correction of neurovascular defects typically seen in DR. We will test our
hypothesis using IVT formulations of UAB126 and UAB30 and two diabetic mouse models, as well as ex vivo
retinal models, primary human retinal microvascular endothelial and human retinal pigment epithelial cell
cultures, and a diverse set of molecular biological applications. In Aim#1, we proposed to determine the
physiological effect of RXR-based therapy in diabetic retinas by assessing the pharmacokinetics of UAB126-
MP and UAB30-MP and the therapeutic impact of IVT rexinoids to prevent and reverse DR. In Aim#2, we will
investigate the cellular mechanism of RXR-based therapy by examining the control of RXR on retinal lipid
profile and reveal the retinal cell type most vulnerable to RXR deficiency in diabetes. In Aim#3, we will focus on
molecular mechanisms of RXR-based therapy by investigating the requirement of PPAR and/or LXR as
binding partners of RXR in the retina and the gene expression network regulated by PPAR and LXR
responsive elements as consequences of IVT rexinoid delivery. This proposed study is highly innovative and
has marked translational significance by targeting retinal lipotoxicity and retinal inflammation and could be
tested not only as a monotherapy but also in combination with existing therapies for DR. Our interdisciplinary
team has expertise in drug discovery, ocular drug delivery, cell biology, biochemistry, and metabolism of the
diabetic retina and thus we have all the tools necessary to successfully accomplish this translational research."

Despite high enrollment in medical school and graduate programs, women remain under-represented in the
biomedical research workforce. NIH T32 training programs are an understudied yet important contributor to the
biomedical research workforce and are a key stage at which we can intervene. While roughly half of trainees
covered by T32 grants are women, women remain underrepresented amongst those earning extramural
research support. Given its prevalence in both medicine and science, sexual harassment is likely a contributor
to this disparity. Data from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine describe the
damage caused by sexual harassment, ultimately leading to a costly loss of talent as women, particularly
women with intersectional identities, and sexual and gender minorities leave. The drivers of sexual
harassment, including factors and conditions that allow it to thrive, have been described with a conceptual
model incorporating an iceberg as a metaphor. The vast majority of sexual harassment, this model contends, is
the portion of the iceberg that is invisible under water. Because of this, many do not fully perceive the
prevalence of sexual harassment; however, the behaviors described in this model are damaging whether they
are visible (i.e., above water) or not. Despite these data, it is not yet clear what interventions can effectively
decrease the occurrence of sexual harassment. Newer interventions, such as civility and upstander
interventions, have been recommended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but have not been
rigorously tested. Data suggest that interventions that go beyond sexual harassment alone and address other
related issues, such civility and upstander interventions, may be more effective than sexual harassment
training alone. We will conduct a randomized, controlled trial of NIH T32 programs to test whether a multi-
modal virtual intervention incorporating video game elements can increase T32 Principal Investigators’ and
mentors’ confidence in their ability to intervene when they hear about or see sexual harassment and increase
their knowledge on these topics. Furthermore, we will test the impact of the intervention on their mentees’
experiences with microaggressions and sexual harassment, sense of belonging, well-being, research
productivity, and persistence in a biomedical research career. Finally, we will test whether the intervention
improves the culture and climate of the learning environment. Rigorous evaluation of a virtual interactive
intervention to address and reduce sexual harassment for NIH T32 trainees can result in a generalizable and
easily scalable educational program to improve NIH training environments nationwide and ultimately improve
the diversity of the biomedical research workforce."

 My laboratory discovers metabolic adaptations required for cells to function, proliferate, and survive in
low-nutrient metabolic environments, identifies small molecule inhibitors that target these metabolic
vulnerabilities, and develops techniques to discover new metabolites and metabolic pathways. Cells require
nutrients to make biomolecules required for growth and proliferation, and restricted availability of these nutrients
prevents cell growth. Nutrient limits are imposed by the extracellular environment, such as the brain interstitial
fluid, which maintains low levels of amino acids such as serine and glycine. These amino acids serve as
neurotransmitters, and are needed to make proteins, nucleotides, and antioxidants. Cells also make some
metabolites, such as coenzymes, in limiting quantities. Coenzymes are organic cofactors required for all
metabolic pathways, and in unicellular organisms are made in a “just-in-time” manner to match cell growth. In
addition to carbon and nitrogen-based nutrients, most of the human body, including the brain and bone marrow,
maintains physiologic oxygen tensions below ambient oxygen availability. Oxygen is used for cellular respiration,
but also is the substrate for a variety of enzymes, such as the dioxygenases, that synthesize metabolites and
maintain epigenetic homeostasis. Both acute and chronic nutrient depletion and hypoxia contribute to the
pathogenesis of many diseases including autoimmune disease, cardiac disease, and cancer. Cells entering,
growing, or proliferating in the brain or other low-nutrient environments must find other sources of serine, glycine,
and coenzymes or synthesize their own, and prioritize the efficient use of nutrients and oxygen.
 Over the next five years, we will identify the metabolic adaptations needed for cells to enter the brain,
determine if cells acquire these adaptations before they enter the brain or adapt following entry into the brain,
and target these adaptations with small molecule inhibitors. These studies will reveal metabolic targets whose
inhibition could prevent diseases caused by cells inappropriately entering the brain, and offer proof of concept
that targeting these adaptations would be of therapeutic value in diseases ranging from autoimmune disease to
brain metastases. We also will define the enzymes, intermediates, and regulatory mechanisms of the mammalian
Coenzyme Q10 headgroup synthesis pathway, which we recently discovered, and determine how cells produce
the precise quantities of coenzymes needed for cell growth. Finally, we have developed novel techniques for
tracing isotopically labeled gases into metabolites. We will use these techniques to discover metabolic pathways
critical for the survival of cells in low-oxygen environments. These pathways have evaded discovery due to
metabolic pathway redundancy or metabolite sharing. These projects will address longstanding unanswered
questions in metabolic adaptation, reveal coenzyme-dependent mechanisms of cell growth control, and
systematically identify new oxygen-dependent vulnerabilites in intermediary metabolism."

Chronic liver disease is common and its pathogenic mechanisms are complex. There are no high throughput
genetic methods to uncover mechanisms that drive progression to cirrhosis. As a result, therapies that slow the
progression of liver disease are not currently available for most etiologies. The observation that our tissues
accumulate a large number of somatic mutations with age and chronic injury could provide a genetic window
into this process. Diseased livers harbor innumerable isolated islands of mosaic clones, but the identity and
functional importance of the somatic alterations within these clones remain undiscovered. In the past, somatic
mutations were generally assumed to be detrimental to health or drive cancer, but recently, some mutations
have been shown to exert adaptive effects that might benefit tissue health. In the liver, deep sequencing
experiments are beginning to reveal diverse somatic alterations, visually exemplified by the innumerable
nodules on cirrhotic livers. Stimulated by this landscape of mutations, we have developed in vivo genetic
screens to identify somatic mutations that have the greatest functional impact. Preliminary studies show that
some mutations can increase tissue regeneration and others can prevent metabolic liver disease. An emerging
concept is that cells can select for mutations that ameliorate, rather than cause, diseases such as
steatohepatitis or cancer. We believe that somatic mosaicism is an open frontier for human genetics, and
represents a potential source of unidentified disease genes and therapeutic targets. Using new technologies
developed in my lab, we propose to exploit somatic mosaicism as a genetic strategy to 1) identify adaptive
genetic pathways that are specific to particular liver disease etiologies, and 2) understand how mutant clones
expand within chronically damaged tissues, and potentially protect from disease in a therapeutic fashion."

Clinician scientists, and physician scientists in particular, are needed to advance the translational
research agenda. This is particularly true in rehabilitation, where the evidence base to support
practice is under-developed. The Rehabilitation Medicine Scientist Training Program (RMSTP)
aims to identify and recruit a diverse group of physician candidates for research careers in
rehabilitation; to optimally prepare those candidates to develop a competitive mentored career
development funding application; to support productivity during training and facilitate a
transition to scientific independence. To achieve these aims, the RMSTP, in collaboration with
the Association of Academic Physiatrists conducts an annual 3-day Research Career
Development (RCD) Workshop, supplemented by quarterly small group teleconferences
throughout the year, to support continued progress and productivity. The RMSTP is divided into
4 phases, which are reflected in content tracks in the RCD workshop and in the focus of the
teleconferences. The pre-applicant phase helps participants define their area of research interest
and identify suitable local mentors. The applicant phase provides guidance, including critical
peer review, on developing competitive applications for career development funding. The funded
fellow phase provides support to maximize productivity in training, including critical peer
review of research applications, and to apply that training to rehabilitation problems Finally, the
graduate phase provides ongoing support, as needed, to facilitate the transition to independence
and continue to develop their research programs. Didactic and hands-on training at the RCD
Workshop is provided by a diverse multidisciplinary Program Faculty consisting of successful
extramurally funded rehabilitation researchers focused on a broad range of basic and applied
topics. Quarterly small-group teleconferences are led by one of 4 Executive Committee members
all of whom are experienced and well-funded rehabilitation researchers and mentors. The
RMSTP, which had great success in the current cycle, has designed evaluation and continuous
quality improvement methods aimed at the RCD Workshop content, the diversity and quality of
the applicant pool, and the aggregate results of training with respect to key benchmarks of
scientific productivity."

Cardiovascular disease in the American population is continuously a major source of debilitation and death
despite increased prevention, diagnostic, and treatment options. This calls for increased scientific understanding
and innovative application of these findings to the care of patients to prevent or cure heart disease. This training
program in cardiovascular innovation is designed to teach the scientific and technical skills necessary to develop
a novel idea and carry this idea through to proof-of-concept in humans. The training program takes unique
advantage of the strengths of the Lillehei Heart Institute, the University of Minnesota Cardiovascular Division,
the wider community of translational medicine and entrepreneurship at the University of Minnesota, and the Twin
Cities biotech, pharma, and device industries. This application will train basic and clinical scientists in an
interdisciplinary environment to give them the insight and tools to be able to successfully carry an idea from
conception to implementation in humans. Therefore, the goal of this Training Program is to provide an
interdisciplinary research and training environment wherein trainees will be exposed to the continuum of
technological development from conceptual idea to testing at the basic, small animal, large animal, and human
levels. Trainees will be advantaged by community strengths in basic, translational, and clinical science, training
in cardiovascular innovation and entrepreneurship, and industry interactions and mentorship. There are several
unique features of this training program: 1) the focus on cardiovascular sciences, 2) the scientific qualification of
its Trainers, 3) the curriculum focused on innovation, 4) the presence of industry mentors, and 5) the opportunity
for meaningful industry interactions. The program will consist of a basic cardiovascular curriculum augmented
by specific training in cardiovascular innovation. Each trainee has the opportunity to participate in the Bakken
Innovation Fellows Program. The goal of this program is to train the next leaders in MedTech by fostering
leadership and teaching risk management for medical innovations. Trainees will also partake of the Carlson
School of Management Medical Industry Leadership Institute (MILI) program offerings. MILI offers students
innovative experiences through industry-specific courses and unique, hands-on evaluations of emerging
technologies from around the globe. Trainees will take at least 2 relevant half-day courses offered by the
Technological Leadership Institute: 1) Innovation, Leadership & Communication, 2) How to Create and Stimulate
a Culture of Innovation, 3) Communication in a Technical Environment: Developing Writing and Presenting Skills,
and 4) the yearly Innovation Workshop ""Becoming a Medical Technology Innovator."" Trainees will engage in a

(GU) is to provide our pre-doctoral trainees with in-depth knowledge and understanding of the
basic molecular mechanisms that underlie tumor initiation and progression, as well as with the
basic principles of cancer therapy and its translational applications. This highly successful
graduate training program is the only NCI-funded pre-doctoral training program at Georgetown
University (GU) and is the only GU training program dedicated to cancer research. The goal of
the program is to provide not only a rigorous training platform, but also T32-dedicated
research/training resources, including a personalized program for career development deeply
integrated into numerous educational and networking opportunities. This renewal application
incorporates a new leadership structure with the addition of Dr. Chunling Yi as part of a multi-PI
team with the current PI, Dr Anna Riegel. We request support for 6 predoctoral trainees who will
participate in an individualized training program consisting of integrated research, course work,
workshops, programmatic activities, exposure to clinical/translational aspects of cancer,
professional/career development, networking opportunities and engagement with cancer
advocates. The 35 TBTP faculty are drawn from the three highly interactive programs, Cancer
Cell Biology (CCB), Cancer Host Interaction (CHI) & Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) of our
NCI-designated Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC). These programs reflect
emerging themes in tumor biology, which include an enhanced focus on tumor immunology,
epigenetic regulation, mechanisms of therapy resistance, as well as cancer prevention and
control, especially in under-represented populations. The LCCC integrated environment
stimulates interdisciplinary collaborations, co-mentoring opportunities, and translational
initiatives. The TBTP has experienced much success over its 27-year history. For the next funding
period, we will continue to address the changing landscape of cancer research through constant
assessment and evolution of our program. We have incorporated a number of new initiatives
designed to provide new opportunities for cutting edge research, data analysis, translational
emphaisis and individualized learning coupled with professional development and wellness
support of all our trainees. Going forward we have also enhanced our rigor and reproducibility
and mentor training and have established an Advisory Committee for Diversity & Inclusion. We
will continue to challenge ourselves in all aspects of TBTP training consistent with the NCI mission
of “supporting cancer research across the nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all

 Growing clinical evidence suggests that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk-factor over an
individual’s lifetime, and results in symptoms and pathophysiology consistent with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD). Rodent models recapitulate early pathological clinical features of TBI, but it
is unknown if these models manifest long-term ADRD features such as cognitive decline, neurodegenerative
brain atrophy, chronic inflammation, vascular disturbances, and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and altered
fluid biomarker levels. Well-known risk factors for TBI-induced ADRD (i.e. APOE, sex etc.) influence
susceptibility for lifespan progression, but the role of TBI pathophysiology has not been well characterized.
This proposal will fill these knowledge gaps using a closed head injury (CHI) TBI model over the animal’s
lifespan that exhibits ADRD-like features. Using the CHI TBI model, we will examine how AD risk alleles (i.e.
humanized amyloid-β (hAβ), APOEε4, and hAβ.APOEε4) accelerate ADRD progression. Importantly, cognitive
behavioral outcomes, clinically relevant neuroimaging (PET, MRI) using established protocols (ADNI3)
combined with fluid biomarkers will be used to assess disease advancement. Construct and face validity
measures (within and between performance sites will be demonstrated using multi-modal data modeling to
confirm replicability and to differentiate between TBI+ADRD from TBI or ADRD trajectories alone.
 Using our CHI TBI mouse model, which replicates human mild/moderate TBI, and exhibits altered blood
brain barrier (BBB), progressive cognitive decline, late Aβ deposition, chronic neuroinflammation, and
progressive vascular perturbations, we will establish in sex and age-specific manner the conditions for TBI
evolution to ADRD. We also will leverage NIA-funded MODEL-AD platform mice expressing hAβ and APOEε4
on a C57BL/6J (B6) background, as significant risk factors for ADRD progression. Using these models
exposed to TBI, we will investigate how injury exposure at 3 epochs (juvenile 17D; middle 8M, old 12M) across
lifespan (24M of age) influences progression to ADRD (Aim 1). A repeated CHI TBI will be identically tested
to demonstrate a further increased vulnerability to ADRD (Aim 2). Finally, we will leverage these multi-modal
data in an unbiased manner to establish internal/external consistency and reproducibility (construct validity)
as well as modeling how this maps to human progressive trajectories to dissociate TBI+ADRD from TBI or
ADRD alone (Aim 3). These Aims will demonstrate, validate, and replicate our hypothesis that TBI throughout
the lifespan continuum leads to age-specific trajectories towards ADRD symptomology. The proposed
research will result in a deeply phenotyped TBI model as it progresses to ADRD, and the role of sex and age
of injury. The derived data will serve as a significant resource to accelerate future research into the
mechanisms of TBI ADRD."
10933855,"The blood-tumor barrier (BTB) hinders the delivery and penetration of systemically administered
therapeutic agents into the brain tumor microenvironment. The BTB is created by dilated and leaky microvessels
that cause regional perfusion variability and poor convective delivery gradients, often while still retaining
enhanced efflux transporter expression and tight-junction integrity. To enhance therapeutic delivery across the
BTB, we and others have deployed non-invasive, MR image-guided, transcranial pulsed focused ultrasound
(FUS), in combination with microbubbles (MBs). MBs oscillate upon exposure to FUS, exert mechanical stresses
on the microvasculature, and open the BTB for augmented payload delivery. Yet, despite the promise of this
approach, there is still room for significant improvement. Indeed, spatial perfusion variability still limits MB access,
dilated tumor vessels have diminished contact with oscillating intravascular MBs, and high interstitial tumor
pressure still limits transport when the BTB is opened. Here, we aim to overcome these obstacles to more
effective FUS+MBs-mediated drug delivery by “pre-normalizing” brain tumor microvasculature via VEGF-R2
blockade, a pharmacological approach not limited by the BTB because VEGFR2+ endothelium is in direct contact
with the bloodstream. We posit that vascular normalization will improve FUS+MB drug delivery because it
reduces interstitial tumor pressure, improves tumor perfusion and oxygenation, and reverses tumor endothelial
cell anergy that limits immune cell infiltration and function.
 In this proposal, for models of both primary and metastatic brain tumors, we will develop FUS+MB based
approaches that leverage vascular normalization to improve drug delivery across the BTB. Aim 1 will be to
identify vascular normalization timing window(s) that provide optimal conditions for focused ultrasound-mediated
drug delivery to brain tumors. We will identify such optimal windows for delivery of 2 different sized MRI contrast
agents [MultiHance (~1 kDa; simulating small molecule drugs) and Gad-IgG (~150 kDa; simulating mAb
immunotherapy)]. T1 MRI mapping will be used to precisely quantify the spatiotemporal distribution of contrast
agent after FUS+MB-mediated delivery. Aim 2 will use this information and leverage vascular normalization to
augment therapeutic efficacy of focused ultrasound-mediated immunotherapy delivery to brain tumors. Here, we
will deliver promising immunotherapies (αCD47 and αPD-1) that we hypothesize may best benefit from FUS+MB
delivery in the setting of vascular normalization and may also be rapidly translated into clinical trials at our
institution. Studies will include longitudinal assessment of tumor growth by MRI, generation of Kaplan-Meier
curves for animal survival, and histological analysis of tumor response. Because vascular normalization offers
opportunities for enhanced immune cell infiltration via augmented endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression,
we will also test whether tumor control occurs through CD4 and/or CD8 T cell-dependent mechanisms."

Dialysis vascular access (arteriovenous fistulae [AVF] and arteriovenous grafts [AVG]) is the Lifeline
for the 500,000+ patients on hemodialysis in the United States (3million+ worldwide). Unfortunately,
both AVFs and AVGs have high failure rates due to an aggressive venous segment stenosis which
results in multiple interventional procedures, hospitalizations, and increased catheter (CVC) use. This
results in vascular access also being the Achilles Heel of hemodialysis and an important unmet clinical
need which results in a very significant morbidity, mortality, and economic cost (over 5B USD per
annum).
In this proposal we will combine expertise and experience from both industry and academia to create
an innovative vascular conduit (the Functional INtegrated Electrospun [FINE] device) that comprises
an inner Cu-PAS core surrounded by an outer P4HB sheath that will have (a) a precisely controlled
microstructure to promote host cell integration (b) anti-bacterial and immunomodulatory properties (c)
vein-artery-matched geometry to minimize upstream injury pathways and (d) an intrinsic self-sealing
ability that allows for early cannulation.
At an operational level we plan to (a) selectively design, refine and prototype FINE devices (b)
document the safety and efficacy of selected FINE devices in a pig arteriovenous access stenosis
model and (c) develop clinical scale production capabilities for the FINE device.
In summary, this proposal brings together a trio of unlikely partners (industry x 1 and academia x 2)
that between them have the science, the infrastructure, the experience, and the people to bring
disruptive change to dialysis vascular access. While none of us on our own could have done what is
described in this proposal, we would also venture to say that the sum of the individual parts will in this
case be exponentially larger than the whole."

Summary.
Numerous studies in human populations, human tissue, animal models and cell culture demonstrate that
environmental genotoxic and oxidative stress are associated with accelerated telomere shortening and
dysfunction. Telomeres at chromosome ends are essential for genome stability and sustained cell proliferation,
and dysfunctional telomeres contribute to degenerative diseases and carcinogenesis in humans. The goals of
this project are to advance exciting discoveries and highly innovative work from two NIEHS funded R01 awards
investigating the consequences of nucleobase damage and excision repair at telomeres. The overarching
hypothesis for this R35 proposal is that telomere shortening and dysfunction caused by environmental
genotoxic and oxidative stress, occurs via formation of specific base lesions and toxic repair intermediates that
directly interfere with telomere replication and maintenance. Working with collaborators we pioneered a highly
innovative chemoptogenetic tool that selectively induces DNA lesions at telomeres. This technology is
transformative because targeting well-defined base damage to telomeres allows us to unequivocally attribute
phenotypic changes and health outcomes to the induced telomere lesions, eliminating confounding effects of
damage elsewhere. We fully validated this system for the targeted formation of a common oxidative guanine
lesion at telomeres, and remarkably, we discovered that the chronic generation of this lesion induces profound
hallmarks of telomere dysfunction that mimic genetic loss of telomere shelterin proteins. This project will probe
and uncover the mechanisms of DNA lesion induced telomere loss and dysfunction. A major strategy is to
extend and modify this flexible technology in a phased approach for introducing base damage, toxic repair
intermediates, bulky monoadducts, and other lesion types. We will measure various cellular and telomeric
endpoints after lesion induction and will use candidate and unbiased approaches to identify proteins required
to protect telomeres against the various forms of environmentally relevant DNA damage. This
chemoptogenetic tool has been adapted for use in model organisms, and as the R35 evolves we will translate
what we learn in cell culture to experiments in transgenic zebrafish and mice. Using this system, we will
generate telomeric damage in key organs and cell types and will measure the impact on organ function and
health. This program will lead to significant advances in mechanistic understanding of how environmentally
relevant forms of telomeric DNA lesions impact telomere function, cellular function, and organism health.
Ultimately, knowledge gained from this program will be highly valuable for developing new strategies that 1)
preserve telomeres to ameliorate the effects of genotoxic and oxidative stress in healthy cells or conversely,
that 2) inhibit telomere maintenance in malignant cells to arrest proliferation."
10936042,"Project Summary
More than 90% of cancer mortalities are associated with metastasis. Despite advances in cancer therapies, there
has not been significant progress in metastasis-associated deaths and there are not a lot of targeted treatment
options for late-stage patients. It has been challenging to target metastasis due to the complexity of underlying
mechanisms that lead to it. The phosphatase of regenerating liver 3, PRL3, has emerged as one of the most
promising cancer targets in recent years. It was originally identified as a biomarker for metastasis in colorectal
cancers. Interestingly, it has been implicated in increased invasiveness and metastatic potentials in several other
cancers. While its biological functions remain to be elucidated, studies in cancer models, patient data, and known
substrates all indicate that it has an active role in cellular invasiveness and metastasis. PRL3, therefore,
presents as a valuable molecular target in metastasis. The long-term goal of this project is to develop
migrastatics that specifically target PRL3. Given increasing interests in phosphatase drug discovery, particularly
those that have been linked to cancers, several PRL3 inhibitors have been identified over the past several years.
The promiscuity, non-specific action, and chemical instability of these molecules, however, have prevented
further development. More striking, though, is that none of these inhibitors have been shown to directly bind
PRL3. This prohibits the development of high affinity, selective inhibitors by rational design and optimization as
no atomic level information is available as to how PRL3 interacts with its inhibitors. Our group recently identified
two inhibitors that directly and specifically bind PRL3, the first such inhibitors. The objective of this proposal
is to uncover the molecular determinants of PRL3 druggability and to identify novel molecules with potential to
be developed as migrastatics. The rationale for the proposal is that structural information is critical for rational
drug design, and binders are necessary to get such structural information. Furthermore, this will provide
molecular mechanism of action for potential migrastatics that will be identified. This will be accomplished through
the following specific aims: 1) determine the structure of PRL3 in complex with inhibitors, 2) improve the current
molecules through structure activity relationships, and 3) identify novel fragments through a binding-first
screening by NMR. This proposed research is significant as it will directly contribute to the development of
molecular targeted migrastatics which has high"

Bicyclic peptides are conformationally constrained peptides comprised of two macrocyclic rings. Owing to their
conformational rigidity, bicyclic peptides are highly resistant to proteolysis, and can bind to protein targets with
antibody-like affinity and selectivity. As a result, these molecules are highly desirable scaffolds for the
development of peptide-based therapeutics. Phage display is a laboratory evolution technique that enables the
discovery of high-affinity peptide ligands from large, combinatorial peptide libraries. Although originally limited to
linear peptides, phage display was recently adapted for the discovery of novel bicyclic peptide ligands. Most
often, phage-displayed bicyclic peptide libraries are prepared by chemically modifying linear peptides using
cysteine-reactive small molecules; however, this method is time consuming and technically challenging. As a
result, phage-displayed bicyclic peptide technology has not been widely adopted. Recently, several studies have
used genetic code expansion to install cysteine-reactive noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into phage-displayed
peptides to produce libraries of cyclic peptides. This strategy has significant advantages over the chemical
cyclization approach, but is currently limited to monocyclic peptides. The overarching objective of this
proposal is to develop technology that enables phage display of bicyclic peptides using genetic code
expansion. Our central hypothesis is that bifunctional ncAAs, i.e. ncAAs containing two cysteine-reactive
functional groups, can be used to generate ribosomally synthesized bicyclic peptides by intramolecular reaction
with two cysteine residues. To realize our objective, we will pursue three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will engineer
an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that recognizes bifunctional ncAAs containing two cysteine-reactive moieties.
This will be accomplished using traditional and state-of-the-art methods of directed evolution. In Aim 2 we will
develop a phage display system that is compatible with co-translational installation of bifunctional ncAAs and we
will optimize this system for efficient bicyclic peptide formation. We will then validate this system by selecting
and characterizing bicyclic peptide ligands for two model targets. In Aim 3 we will use our phage-displayed
bicyclic peptide libraries to identify peptides that bind to the spike protein of human coronaviruses and inhibit
virus-host membrane fusion. By targeting spike proteins from diverse coronaviruses, we will strive to identify
inhibitors with broad-spectrum antiviral activity. The proposed work will provide a facile route for generating bi-
cyclic peptide libraries thereby greatly accelerating the discovery of therapeutic peptide leads."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability and represents the most well-
established environmental risk factor for cognitive impairment, progression to clinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and AD related dementia (ADRD). Following injury, brain blood vessels undergo many degenerative changes
ranging from, loss of pericytes (PC), remodeling of the vascular basement membrane (vBM), loss of blood-brain
barrier (BBB) integrity and impaired angiogenesis, which ultimately cause neuronal damage, cognitive decline
and ADRD/AD. BBB disruption in the human hippocampus predicts cognitive impairment in patients. In addition,
the acute inflammatory phase following TBI correlates with post-TBI ADRD/AD trajectories, supporting the idea
that the initial innate immune response, may influence the later adaptive immune response, resulting in
unresolved inflammatory responses, and the risk of post-TBI cognitive impairments and ADRD/AD - progressive
disorders that worsens over time. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that predispose TBI survivors to an increased
risk of ADRD/AD are unknown and consequently there are no treatments. Our parent grant (R33HL159949),
which focuses on understanding the effects of the blood components on NVU function following TBI, compared
to control, is importantly related to the development of ADRD/AD. A major impediment to the development of
therapeutic approaches to neurological disorders has been the lack of human in vitro NVU models that mirror
the spatial organization and molecular characteristics of NVU cells in the human brain. To address this challenge,
during the R61 phase, we established a 3D human blood-BBB interface microfluidic model, which allows for the
integration of defined iPSC derived cell types forming the functional NVU, and sera from patient or controls. The
focus of the R33 phase is to examine the effect of blood components (sera and immune cells) from donors
with/without TBI on BBB/NVU function. This timely Supplement proposal requires research beyond our funded
grant to test this hypothesis through two new aims in line with the original aims from our R33. The overall goal
of this Supplement is to better understand how changes within the acute and chronic peripheral immune
response following TBI, may influence BBB/NVU function over time, and predict progression of post-TBI
associated cognitive impairments and ADRD/AD. In this proposal, we outline a plan to examine the effect of sera
from Veterans (LIMBIC-CENC cohort) with chronic TBI whom develop post-TBI associated ADRD/AD, or do not,
in the BBB/NVU. Specifically, we will examine the influence on BBB cell biology (structural and functional BBB
properties) and NVU function (cell-cell interactions and -communication and functionality). We will use state-of-
the-art single cell kinetic imaging (KIC), transcriptomics, and functional approaches to address these questions.
The proposed work may facilitate discovery of potential biomarkers or pathways and allow development of
therapeutics targeting systemic inflammatory-driven neurological sequelae after TBI, including post-TBI
associated ADRD/AD, or other neurological or neurodegenerative diseases."

In response to the NIH NOT-AG-23-032, the current Alzheimer’s Disease study pilot project
administrative supplement application is to expand the parent R01 award (1R01AG080141-01)
entitled “Cell Senescence Regulating Osteoarthritis Progression: Sex-dependent Mechanisms”
and help develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) focused grants. The R01 focuses on discovering
mechanisms of aging-associated joint degenerative diseases. During this process, we found
common pathological mechanisms shared by both skeletal and neural degenerative diseases
during aging, specifically between aging-associated osteoarthritis (OA) and AD. Both OA and AD
present sexual dimorphism with higher prevalence in older females than older male. However,
the molecular mechanisms responsible for sexual dimorphisms of aging-associated degenerative
diseases are not clear. Recent evidence indicates that de-repression of retrotransposon LINE-1
or L1, which accounts for 17 percent of the human genome, is involved in inflammation and
degeneration of both cartilage joint and brain tissues during aging. We discovered that L1
activation is sex dependent in both mouse OA model and human OA patients by single-cell
transposable element (sc-TE) RNAseq analysis. The scTE methodology that we have developed
to study the relationship between L1 and cartilage joint degeneration can be used to determine
the sex-dependent, cause-effect relationship between L1 and AD. The scientific goal of this
project is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-difference in AD
pathogenesis. The innovative hypothesis is that females are more susceptible to early-onset and
progression of AD during aging because L1 activation is more prevalent in female CNS cell
lineages, which leads to cell senescence, inflammation, and degeneration. This hypothesis will
be tested through two aims as follows. Aim 1: Characterize and compare aging induced L1
activation patterns in the CNS between male and female in an AD transgenic mouse model with
scTE RNAseq. It will establish whether sexual dimorphism of AD progression is associated with
sex-dependent activation of L1 in a CNS cell lineage (neuronal, microglial, and astrocyte) in a
mouse AD model. Aim 2: Characterize and compare L1 activation patterns in the CNS between
male and female human AD patients with scTE RNAseq. It will correlate sexual dimorphism of
AD pathogenesis with sex-dependent activation of L1 in a CNS cell lineage of human AD patients.
The impact of this study is that it will establish whether L1 retrotransposon activation in the CNS
can be a target for sex-specific treatment of AD. It will not only change the concepts that drive the
AD research field, but also impact the clinical practice of how we treat AD patients."

Oral diseases are among the most common chronic conditions of humankind; their origins can often be traced
to socioeconomic and behavioral circumstances much earlier in life. Frequently overlooked are key life
transitions when behaviors and circumstances are especially fluid and potentially malleable with appropriately
tailored interventions. Emerging adulthood (the transitional period from adolescence to adulthood) is one such
life stage that has garnered limited attention in oral health research. Emerging adulthood is a particularly
sensitive period marked by changes in socioeconomic stressors, health risk factors, and potential protective
opportunities as young people enter new social circumstances. This proposed project combines detailed
measures of economic, social, and behavioral factors with quality assessments of oral and systemic health in a
diverse, prospective emerging adult cohort. We will examine potential interactions by race/ethnicity and gender
identities and the specific behavioral pathways connecting socioeconomic factors to disease risk, potentially
revealing health promotion opportunities during this formative developmental period. Indeed, such insight
informs a long-term objective to test how acquired access to socioeconomic opportunity afforded by higher
education impacts the trajectory of oral diseases, especially among those from minoritized and/or
disadvantaged backgrounds.
This time-sensitive proposal leverages the now-launching NHLBI-supported Economic and Educational
Contributions to Emerging Adults' Cardiometabolic Health (“3E”) cohort study of 4,000 diverse first-year college
students from two public Hispanic-Serving Institutions of higher education (>50% first-generation college
students, >40% Pell Grant recipients). This proposal augments rich prospective economic and behavioral data
with oral health-specific risk factors and self-reported and objective measures oral health. Specifically, this
project will: Aim 1. Examine the influences of early adulthood socioeconomic stressors on oral health over
time, including as potentially modified by race/ethnicity and gender. Aim 2. Examine the contributions of
education-related opportunities (e.g., academic engagement programming, basic needs supports, social
capital) as protective factors against adverse oral health outcomes (e.g., service non-utilization, gingival
inflammation). Aim 3. Assess the mechanistic role of health-related behaviors in linking socioeconomic
stressors and education-related opportunities to oral health outcomes.
Emerging adulthood, a transition period in health behaviors and socioeconomic opportunity, is a potential pivot
point in the development of chronic diseases and health inequality. Understanding influences of oral diseases
near their emergence will inform more effective oral disease prevention efforts."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life-altering event that leads to long-lasting motor impairment. Currently, there is no
cure for paralysis. Electrical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) combined with exercise training can restore posture
control, stepping, and voluntary walking in humans with SCI. However, the neurorecovery mechanisms induced
by electrical neuromodulation of the spinal cord are poorly understood. This project will generate evidence-based
knowledge of changes in short-term excitability and long-term plasticity of the neural circuits that may mediate
SCS-induced improvements in motor function. Participants with SCI and control subjects will perform 30-min leg
training sessions with a non-invasive body-machine interface controlling a computer cursor, and perform game-
like activities using voluntary movements and/or non-invasive transcutaneous SCS. We will quantify changes in
corticospinal, reticulospinal, and spinal neural excitability will be quantified by comparing motor-evoked potentials
elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation, the StartReact response, and the F-wave responses respectively
before and after training. We will determine (1) short-term changes in neural excitability that are independently
enabled by SCS and activity-based training, (2) whether task-specific training used commonly used in
rehabilitation enhances short-term changes in neural excitability, and (3) long-term changes in neural plasticity
mediated by SCS combined with activity-based training in individuals with chronic SCI. A clear understanding of
SCS-enhanced neural mechanisms and how they promote neural plasticity through residual corticospinal,
reticulospinal, and spinal connections will promote the development of personalized therapies that directly target
the specific excitability and plasticity states of these circuits to promote and enhance functional recovery in
individuals with SCI. Throughout the award period, I will obtain new skills and expertise in conducting clinical
studies as the lead investigator. In addition, I will gain further training in neurophysiological evaluations of motor
and sensory function, evaluation of cortical and spinal cord plasticity, spinal cord stimulation, career
development, and R01-level grant writing. To accomplish the proposed research and training, I have assembled
a multi-disciplinary team of world class mentors who are committed to my success. This training will build on my
previous experience in clinical and translational research as a trainee and ultimately provide me with the
knowledge and skillset to establish an independent research program and transition into an independent R01-
funded investigator leading global progress in understanding and exploiting neuroplasticity after SCI."
10925177,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
There is a need for integrative data analyses that anchor transcriptomic research in contexts predictive of
human health, as illustrated by growing awareness of disease-associated synonymous transcript variants
and RNA biotechnologies such as mRNA vaccines. To help uncover sequence features that are important
for RNA regulation, we present context-dependent models of translational efficiency, a key metric of
transcript function. We show that position-dependent codon usage bias (PDCUB) identifies start codons
among AUGs more consistently than the Kozak sequence, while high-PDCUB transcripts are enriched for
medically important genes tied to human development and neural function. Attention-based transformer
networks and interpretation techniques will independently predict translational efficiency in human
transcripts, with comparison to ribosome profiling and RNA abundance data in multiple human cell lines,
to characterize how PDCUB and other sequence features guide translational efficiency across health-
critical contexts. Transfection assays validate the roles of predicted sequence features.
 Beyond sequence, higher-order structures also drive RNA function and stability, including
translational regulation and interactions with microRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). A new RNA
structural alignment method and associated clustering will uncover structural domains and group them
by mutual similarity to find common structural motifs that impact RNA structure-function relationships,
improving our understanding of the role of transcript structure in pathogenesis. Evaluation will consist of
clustering RNA families in our previously built RNA structure meta-database, bpRNA-1m, with identified
structural domains analyzed in the context of ribosome profiling data to characterize the role of these
domains in regulating translation. Meanwhile, clustering structures according to RNA-protein crosslinking
data will let us identify motifs involved in the binding of RBPs.
 Finally, a comprehensive transcriptome browser and meta-database will integrate transcriptomic
data for known and new transcript-level features, including those described above. Easy to access and
use, this resource will enable scientific and medical researchers to find and define RNA sequence features
and structural motifs. By cohesively cataloging the complex facets of transcript-level interactions, along
with sequence and structural features relevant for transcript regulation, our transcriptome browser will
help researchers visualize ribosomal occupancy, examine RNA structures, microRNA and RBP binding,
catalog splice variants, and understand the sequence features that drive transcript interactions. Allelic
variants mapped to RNA transcript positions will be combined our annotations, along with feature-based
machine learning predictions incorporated into the browser, to assist researchers in generating first-pass
predictions of transcript variants and interpreting their outcomes in the context of human health."
10925397,"Head and neck cancer poses significant treatment challenges due to high rates of recurrence after definitive
therapy for locally advanced disease. Radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin has been the standard of care
for non-surgical management of head and neck cancer for the past 15 years, with no recent therapeutic
advances to improve outcomes for head and neck cancer that is unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection. Preclinical models of HPV-negative head and neck cancer are critical to improve the understanding
of the biology of these tumors to devise novel treatment strategies. Most currently available preclinical head
and neck cancer models utilize xenografts in immunodeficient mice or syngeneic transplant tumor models,
which have limited tumor heterogeneity and do not recapitulate gradual co-evolution of human tumors with an
intact immune system. This lack of preclinical models that mimic human head and neck cancer development
and metastasis represents a substantial barrier to studying tumor biology and discovering effective new
therapies for this disease. To address this gap, the current proposal employs novel spatially and temporally
restricted carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered mouse models of head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma in immunocompetent mice to interrogate mechanisms of chemoradiation resistance and to assess
novel therapeutic combinations with radiation therapy. The long-term goal of this research is to identify and test
new approaches to improve radiation response and to reduce development of metastatic disease for head and
neck cancer patients. In preparation for launching a successful independent research program, receipt of a
K08 Award will facilitate credentialing these novel primary preclinical tumor models. Moreover, a K08 Award
will provide the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skill sets to study genetic alterations and epigenetic
changes affecting tumor response and resistance to therapy. In addition, it will facilitate protected time for
focused training in grant writing, laboratory management, and career development. The proposed research is
innovative because it employs the first preclinical models with spatially and temporally restricted tumors
induced by genetic mutations that are commonly identified in human head and neck cancer, along with
exposure to a clinically relevant carcinogen present in tobacco. These novel models will be used to test the
hypothesis that targeting the ATR DNA damage response pathway and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-
1) immune checkpoint with concomitant radiation therapy will improve local and distant control of head and
neck cancer. This research will establish a preclinical platform for improving understanding of head and neck
cancer biology and for evaluating new therapeutic combinations with radiation therapy for this difficult to treat
disease."
10921064,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Alzarrok Bio is developing a peptide, derived from the human defense protein cathepsin G, as a
multitarget drug for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Existing drugs can temporarily mitigate symptoms or
marginally delay the progression of the disease in certain patients but absence of safe and effective
pharmacological treatment for AD remains a huge unmet clinical need. AD drugs (existing or currently in
development) usually engage a single specific target. This appears to be insufficient to significantly inhibit
the complex pathogenesis driving the progression of AD. Our solution is a peptide entity (ALZ100) with
inherent multitarget activity against 4 mediators of AD, which are driving a feed-forward loop between
neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. ALZ100 inhibits and reverses the formation of Aβ1-42
oligomers and fibrils; binds with high affinity the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE),
the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9); inhibits Aβ1-42 -induced
neuronal cell death; and suppresses the activation of TLR4 by S100A9. The targets of ALZ100 (Aβ1-42,
RAGE, TLR4, and S100A9) are overexpressed in the brain of AD patients and inhibition of each one of
them was shown to protect against AD-like phenotype in mouse models.
Building on our in vitro characterization of multitarget activity, our specific aim is to demonstrate the
activity of ALZ100 in vivo, by showing target engagement and inhibition of neuroinflammation
and neurodegeneration in an AD mouse model. We will use the double transgenic mouse model
APP/PS1 that recapitulates salient features of the AD pathogenesis, including Aβ deposition,
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and upregulation of the 4 targets of ALZ100. We will first infuse
wild-type (WT) mouse brain with low, medium, or high concentrations of ALZ100 and measure steady
state concentrations of the drug in brain and blood. We will then infuse both APP/PS1 and WT mouse
with saline alone, low, medium, or high concentrations of ALZ100 and measure the expression level of
each target, the activation of TLR4 and RAGE receptors by measuring transcription of downstream target
genes, as well as other markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.
At the conclusion of phase 1, we expect to have demonstrated efficacy of ALZ100 to inhibit
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in an AD mouse model and determined therapeutic
concentration of the drug in the brain. In phase 2, we will formulate ALZ100 for intranasal administration
and conduct preclinical efficacy studies in mouse models of AD, using extended intranasal treatment with
ALZ100. Completion of this project will advance our long-term goal, which is the development of a new
generation of drugs for AD, with game-changing multitarget activity and superior delivery method for safe
and effective treatment of patients with AD."
10921573,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Sepsis is one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the US, impacting nearly 1.7 million adults each year
and upwards of 250,000 deaths annually. Septic shock is sepsis characterized by hemodynamic failure, with
exceptionally high mortality ranging from 15-70%.
Septic shock management involves treatment with antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressor therapy. The latter, while effective
at hemodynamic support at high doses, is related to major side-effects including peripheral ischemia leading to injury
or loss of extremities (toes, fingers, etc.), kidney injury, liver shock, multiple-organ failure. Thus, it is common that
survivors of septic shock have a high degree of morbidity due to these side-effects.
The goal of this proposal is to validate a new, minimally invasive approach to producing the beneficial effects of
vasopressor therapy without the side-effects. We propose that left stellate ganglion nerve stimulation (SGNS) can be
used to aid in hemodynamic support during septic shock, and therefore can markedly reduce, or even obviate, the need
for high-dose vasopressor administration.
To make this clinically practical, we have developed a novel, minimally invasive percutaneous approach to left stellate
ganglion nerve stimulation that is controlled via a closed-loop system that is capable of altering stimulation
automatically to changes in hemodynamic and other bio-markers (e.g., arterial pressure, heart rate).
This project will be completed in several sequential stages. For this Phase I SBIR we will demonstrate proof of
physiological concept that left stellate ganglion nerve stimulation in a known sepsis model can 1) provide and sustain a
minimum degree of hemodynamic support (at least 15 mmHg for 30 minutes in mean arterial pressure), 2) that direct
SGNS lowers vasopressor requirements compared to control by 50%. Separately, we will show that percutaneous SGNS
using our proprietary system is safe, feasible and equivalent to direct SGNS in management of septic shock.
Successful completion of the specific aims will lead to the development of a clinical-grade system (stimulator controller
and percutaneous lead) that can be validated and verified for Phase II of the project and evaluated clinical in an early
feasibility IDE trial."
10934047,"PRECISION CANCER MODELING SHARED RESOURCE – PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The need for institutional support for pre-clinical animal testing was noted in a prior Yale Cancer Center (YCC).
This capability is a key component of translating YCC laboratory discoveries into new cancer therapies. The
demand for this capability was identified in a YCC membership survey and was subsequently endorsed by the
Shared Resources Oversight Committee (SROC) and the YCC Internal Advisory Board (IAB). The IAB was
supportive and recommended that a facility be developed and based at Yale West Campus. A committee
produced an implementation plan that was endorsed by YCC Mini-Cabinet. PCM opened as a YCC Core and
shared resource in development in 2019 with support from CCSG Developmental Funds.
The mission of the PCM is to enable YCC members to perform state-of-the-art pre-clinical evaluation of cancer
therapies and advanced imaging studies via three aims. Aim 1. Provide expert consultation and technological
services for preclinical evaluation of experimental cancer therapies. Aim 2. Generate and validate novel pre-
clinical mouse models and make them available for evaluation of novel therapeutics under development at Yale
and other institutions. Aim 3. Provide access to and instruction for the use of advanced small animal imaging.
The PCM provides state-of-the-art in vivo preclinical pharmacology services by providing comprehensive
consultation integrated with cutting-edge laboratory infrastructure capable of performing a full suite of studies for
evaluation of experimental anti-cancer therapies. Apart from standard in vivo tumor models, the PCM custom-
develops state-of-the-art animal models tailored to evaluate an experimental therapy based on its mechanism of
action. Unique models developed by PCM include i) a disseminated metastasis model for evaluating local and
abscopal effects of intra tumorally injected agents, ii) immunotherapy-resistant, engineered knock-out models,
and iii) tumor models calibrated for responses to standard-of-care therapeutics. The PCM has also developed
3D ex vivo models with the potential for high throughput testing of therapeutics. The exclusive availability of
innovative models, expert implementation, and rapid generation of preclinical data has fueled a great interest in
utilizing the PCM models for validation of immune therapies within the Yale community. Sponsored Research
Agreements have been established with pharma companies who have also expressed interest in these models
that may found broader industry-academic partnerships. In 2020, in response to YSM user needs for in vivo
imaging, PCM obtained two new IVIS imagers and a high-resolution MRI to form imaging clusters in the vivaria
of both the YSM and Yale West campus (YWC). These instruments cover a broad range of in vivo applications
including bioluminescence, fluorescence, X-ray and MR imaging of live animals. PCM provides training and
oversees use at both locations."
10932571,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the ‘Cardiovascular Research and Drug Development’ (CRDD) training program at Baylor College
of Medicine (BCM) is to train predoctoral (PhD and MD/PhD) students by integrating them into the forefront of a
highly interactive and cross-disciplinary research community in the world’s largest medical center. Our goal is to
train a diverse group of future scientists and physician-scientists focused on increasing the basic understanding
of cardiovascular disease and on discovering and developing new treatments modalities for affected patients.
 Predoctoral trainees will be selected from among 7 graduate (PhD) programs at BCM. Moreover,
prospective PhD students will be recruited from several postbaccalaureate programs at BCM and allied HBCUs,
two avenues proven to increase the number of applicants from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. The
CRDD program consists of formal didactic courses, responsible conduct of research courses, grant writing
courses, and intense personalized mentoring. Trainees also participate in mentored journal clubs, attend
biweekly seminars, and present at an annual symposium. All mentors and mentees are required to take National
Research Mentor Network (NRMN) courses. Program leadership will train junior faculty to become future
preceptors in the program. The rich training environment includes facilities and programs provided by the
Cardiovascular Research Institute and the Center for Drug Discovery at BCM. Other unique aspects of our
program include a Therapeutics Module comprised of a journal club, student focused presentations, and fireside
discussions with leaders from the biotech/pharma industry. This will expose students to the nuances of modern
cardiovascular therapeutic development. Finally, our program will foster internship opportunities at local biotech
companies for students to directly observe and participate in aspects of therapeutic development.
 The 21 CRDD mentors (basic scientists and physician-scientist) have a diverse scientific background
and a strong track record of success in trainee productivity and career outcomes. The predoctoral trainees who
trained in their laboratories during the past 10 years collectively published 381 papers, including many in high
impact journals. Of the TGE predoctoral trainees who completed their Ph.D. degree, 97% had a minimum of one
first-author published paper with an average of 2.5 first author (range 0-10) and an average of 5.5 total
publications (range, 1-22). During the past 5 years alone, our preceptors mentored a total of 39 predoctoral
training grant eligible (TGE) trainees; 28% of those are from underrepresented groups. Of the TGE predoctoral
trainees who completed their training, 95% have remained in research-intensive or research-related fields, and
48% remain affiliated with academic medical centers. Notably, 3 recent (<5 years) graduates have already been
appointed to tenured or tenure-track faculty positions at academic institutions, and 64% of trainees have
garnered independent research funding. Thus, our CRDD training program mentors have an exceptional track
record of attracting and training students for productive careers in cardiovascular research and drug discovery."
10937379,"SUMMARY
The long-term goal of my laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate the development and function
of hair bundles of cochlear hair cells, and how defect in hair bundles cause disease. We propose here to study
the function of two genes, clarin1 (CLRN1) and clarin2 (CLRN2) that have been linked to hearing loss. Mutations
in the murine Clrn1 and Clrn2 genes cause defects in hair bundle development and MET. We hypothesize that
CLRN1 and CLRN2 form protein complexes with proteins that have previously been linked to hair bundle
development and MET to affect the development and function of hair cells. To test our hypothesis, we will use
genetically modified combined with immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy as well as biochemical, cell
biological and electrophysiological methods to study CLRN1 and CLRN2 function in hair cells. Our preliminary
data show the feasibility of our approach. We have identified CLRN1 and CLRN2 binding partners that are
encoded by genes linked to deafness and our findings suggest that these bindings partners act in concert with
CLRN1 and CLRN2 to regulate hair cell development and function."
10937478,"The 4th chromosome is the final frontier for genetic analysis in Drosophila. Small and devoid of recombination
the 4th has long been ignored. Nevertheless, it contains 79 protein coding genes. 92% of the protein coding
genes have human counterparts and 68% of these human genes have a disease association. We propose to
renew our project to build a Comprehensive Resource for the Drosophila 4th Chromosome. The project is highly
visible in the community. It is known as the Fourth Chromosome Resource Project (FCRP) at the Bloomington
and Kyoto stock centers as well as in the FlyBase and FlyPush databases. After three years of funding, the
FCRP has 446 stocks publicly available and is on track to exceed the proposed goal by 15%. To date, four
papers are published and 311 stocks were ordered from Bloomington in 2022. Evidence of impact is that FCRP
stocks constitute 0.3% of the Bloomington stock center, but FCRP shipments supported 13% of the NIH grants
funding stock orders from Bloomington in 2022. Further evidence of impact is that FCRP stocks for the five most
popular 4th genes were ordered at a rate matching the top 3% of all Bloomington stocks. Three of the stock sets
have gone well: 1) the UAS.fly cDNA stocks, 2) the UAS.human homolog cDNA stocks and 3) the conversion of
MiMIC transgenes to gene trap and protein trap stocks. However, during the project we noted several unmet
needs. We propose to address these by continuing to build the two sets that remain incomplete, adding a
UAS.RNAi set, plus conducting validation and phenotyping studies on all FCRP stocks. The Specific Aim remains
to generate a comprehensive resource enabling modern genetic analysis for protein coding genes on the
Drosophila 4th chromosome. One set that will continue is to mutagenize every 4th gene individually on our
FRT101F chromosome for loss of function studies and marked single cell clones. The second continuing set is
UAS.human cDNA stocks for the top two human relatives of each conserved 4th gene. The need to add a set of
UAS.RNAi stocks for genes on the 4th was noted by the PI of the fly Transgenic RNAi Project. Their set of 4th
UAS.RNAi stocks is incomplete and the FCRP was encouraged to finish the job. The need for confidence in our
stocks will be met with experimental validation. The need to provide investigators with a starting point for genetic
analyses will be met by phenotyping. Our systematic observations of phenotypes such as mutant lethality or
sterility plus transcript expression and protein localization are the first data for the 58% of 4th genes that were
never studied before. Validation of gene trap null mutants and their UAS.fly cDNAs in rescue experiments sets
the stage for humanized stocks. When null mutations are rescued by UAS.human cDNAs subsequent mating of
rescued flies creates a humanized stock. These stocks provide opportunities to apply Drosophila genetics to the
analysis of human gene interactions and function. Taken together, FCRP stocks will facilitate all manner of
biochemical, genetic and molecular studies. The resource is readily available to enhance our understanding of
conserved molecular mechanisms underlying human health and disease."
10910505,"Project Summary:
There remains a critical blind spot in the study of biological systems. In situ imaging techniques like super-resolution
microscopy can elucidate cellular dynamics but cannot provide the sub-nanometer resolution needed for molecular
detail. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) does provide atomic-resolution structures yet remains limited to
only systems in their equilibrium states. While both these techniques have been awarded separate Nobel prizes for
their transformative impact on our understanding of biology, a missing gap still exists for how the structure of
biomolecules change in their active state far from equilibrium. The proposed research seeks to bridge this gap. This
project will pioneer the development of electrified cryo-EM (eCryo-EM), a novel tool developed by my research
group that can kinetically trap biological systems in their metastable state away from equilibrium. Briefly, an electrical
stimulus applied just prior to and throughout a plunge-freezing step will capture and preserve metastable states in
electrically excitable biological systems. This approach in using eCryo-EM to capture metastable state is general for
all of biology. Indeed, many fundamental questions remain unanswered for a broad spectrum of electrically excitable
biological systems with important implications for medical applications (e.g., wound healing, electroporation drug
delivery, muscle contraction, sensory acquisition, etc.). As a starting point, this proposal will unravel the first snapshots
of neuron conformational changes through the stages of an action potential across multiple length scales. At the
molecular level, eCryo-EM will reveal the molecular structure of voltage-gated channel proteins as they change
through open, closed, and inactivated states. At the cell level, eCryo-EM will reveal the mechanism of neural inhibition
at the synaptic cleft under high-frequency waveforms. These new insights not only provide fundamental
understanding for neuron behavior under an electrical stimulus, but also will guide future neurostimulation treatments
that are directed and tailored for a specific neural circuit to restore human health in patients suffering from
neurological disease. 3 tasks are outlined to achieve the stated goals: (1) demonstration of an eCryo-EM device that
can successfully trap metastable states of biological systems under an electrical stimulus; (2) elucidating a time series
of structural changes in voltage-gated channel proteins throughout an action potential; and (3) trapping the multiple
conformations of a synaptic junction between neurons throughout electrical stimulation. These tasks cannot be
achieved through conventional methodologies. Rather, it requires a fundamentally new approach in kinetically
trapping the active state biological systems directly under an electrical bias. The proposed research will establish a new
paradigm in investigating how neurons fundamentally behave in response to an external electrical stimulus, thereby
providing new neurostimulation therapeutic targets and strategies for treating neurological diseases."
10913636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, but there are a number of other
related dementias that exhibit substantial overlap in the behavioral, cognitive, and neuropathological
manifestations of the disease. In fact, the majority of dementia cases likely arise from the co-occurrence of one
or more of these AD and AD-related pathologies, with very few individuals exhibiting ‘pure’ Alzheimer’s
pathology (e.g., only amyloid plaques). This complexity makes diagnosis and therapeutic development
challenging, a problem exacerbated by a paucity of accurate animal models for ADRD that faithfully
recapitulate the full spectrum of the molecular, cellular, cognitive, and behavioral pathologies of these
dementias. In response to PAR-19-167, we will create a panel of genetically diverse knock-in mice harboring
known mutations associated with AD and several related dementias using precise genomic editing to ensure
biologically-relevant gene expression patterns and levels. In Aim 1, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to create mice
carrying combinations of disease-causing mutations in App, Psen1, Mapt, Tardbp, and Snca to produce a set
of ‘core’ strains we expect to better capture the complexity of ADRD. To capture the role of genetic background
in disease risk, we will then cross these ‘core’ mice to four genetic backgrounds known to promote
susceptibility or resilience of ADRD (DBA/2J, FVB/NJ, WSB/EiJ, and C57Bl/6J). We will then leverage our
expertise in high-throughput mouse neurobehavioral phenotyping to screen 16 new ADRD strains to identify
the lines that best model ADRD. In Aim 2, we will use our deep phenotyping pipeline to fully characterize our
top strains across the entire spectrum of ADRD-related symptoms, including both cognitive and non-cognitive
domains. We will also use high-field MRI, histopathological measurements, and molecular phenotypes to
assess effects on brain structure, extent of neuropathologies, and impact on gene networks and pathways
associated with disease. Finally, in Aim 3, we will validate our new models for use in basic science and
preclinical studies by determining concordance between mouse and human data and use network modeling
approaches to identify early drivers of disease that predict late-stage outcomes in humans. This project will
produce much-needed new models for AD and related dementias that will greatly enhance our understanding
of the pathological mechanisms underlying these diseases. Finally, all of the models produced here will be
distributed to the community via the JAX Repository. We will also make all of the phenotyping data publicly
available using resources such as Mouse Phenome Database, GeneWeaver, and Synapse."

We propose to renew the NCI Cancer Epidemiology Training Program. In accordance with NCI
instructions limiting support to eight trainees per year, we plan a reduction from the current ten by
removing two postdoctoral positions. We leverage the enormously rich academic environment of the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, together with the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center,
Channing Division of Network Medicine, and a multitude of affiliated institutions within the Boston
medical community, as well as with collaborators outside Massachusetts. These resources include the
Harvard cohorts (Nurses’ Health Studies I, II, and III, Health Professionals Follow-up Study,
Physicians’ Health Study, Women’s Health Study, the VITAL trial, and others). These cohorts have
millions of person-years of repeated follow-up for all cancer sites, as well as blood and tissue samples
from over 100,000 individuals. The opportunities for cancer research within this environment are
virtually limitless. We have brought together outstanding and passionate faculty mentors to provide
integrated interdisciplinary experiences and collaborative interactions, a specialized curriculum with
core and elective coursework, nondidactic practical career training, individual candidate training plans,
and ongoing program evaluation. Cutting-edge didactic training and mentoring will create a new
generation of highly skilled and enthusiastic investigators to study factors that influence cancer
incidence and survival. A major focus is to take advantage of the multitude of modern ‘omics methods,
such as genomics, metabolomics, together with the array of biologic samples, including blood, oral
swabs and stool for microbiome, and tumor tissue. The multidisciplinary training will include applying
modern epidemiologic and biostatistical methods to analyze such data and develop novel approaches
for cancer research. This training program is currently in year 48; we have constantly updated the
program, maintaining approaches that work well, initiating new aspects, and taking advantage of new
opportunities, and revising our mentor group accordingly. We have vigorously sought to increase the
number of mentors and trainees from under-represented minority (URM) groups. We recognize the
need for improvement, but are pleased that 20% of the trainees in the first three years are URM
individuals and 30% in the final two years. With this renewal application, we initiate a new program to
train co-mentors, junior faculty who will be trained to become effective mentors in the future. One
constant feature is that we have never had a shortage of outstanding candidates for the program. With
continued support, we believe this training program will continue to have a major impact to further the
mission of NCI to reduce the burden of cancer through prevention and improved survival."

new paradigm in bone marrow transplantation, focusing on inhibition of epigenetic pathways as a potential
mechanism both to prevent transplant-related organ toxicity and to mitigate graft versus host disease (GVHD).
The role of histone deacetylase inhibitors has been an area of intense research at U-M for the past two decades,
with pre-clinical studies at both cancer centers having led to five multicenter clinical trials over this period. NIH-
funded clinical trials using a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Vorinostat) have been performed in recipients of
reduced and myeloablative conditioning, in a variety of donor cell sources (sibling, unrelated, haplo-identical)
and in both adults and pediatric patients. The proposed project will study the role of epigenetic modifiers in
patients undergoing transplant for non-malignant blood disorders, including those with hemoglobinopathies or
immune-hematologic disorders. The study will use a novel composite endpoint: one-year GVHD-free, event-free
survival, with events defined as death due to any cause, graft rejection/failure, or second HCT, whichever occurs
first. GVHD will be defined as grade III-IV acute GVHD or chronic GVHD requiring systemic immune suppression.
Secondary endpoints include overall survival, primary and secondary graft failure, chimerism and infectious
events. This trial will not only mitigate the severity of GVHD in patients with non-malignant blood disorders, but
also advance the understanding of the biology of epigenetic modifiers in HCT. The U-M Consortium is committed
to the scientific agenda of the BMT CTN and fully anticipates that this research strategy will provide new insights
into reducing regimen-related toxicities in patients undergoing HCT for non-malignant disorders. In summary,
with this research proposal, the U-M Consortium has the potential to bring exciting possibilities to the BMT CTN."

 This is an application requesting for an Administrative Supplement to Enhance Diversity for the NIH U01
HL160274 grant. The proposed combined clinical and bioinformatics studies, although within the scope of the
parent grant, are not in the funded Specific Aims. The long-term goal of the candidate is to pursue a career as a
physician-scientist with a focus on servicing underserved communities. This supplement aims to obtain new
insights on how correlate to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) risk factors by building upon
the existing aims from the parent award. This application will test the overarching hypothesis that
sociodemographic factors at the population and individual levels, social determinants of health (SDoH) are
mechanistically linked to HFpEF phenotypes, comorbidities, and their molecular underpinnings. the proposed
study will obtain retrospective and prospective clinical data and blood samples from HFpEF patients with distinct
SDOH risk. The potential molecular mechanisms will be tested using multi-omic data in HFpEF patients
subjected to SDOH factors. By understanding the SDOH contributions, we will gain insights into patient-specific
treatment to improve their long-term health outcomes. The candidate and the mentors have outlined a
comprehensive training goal and have assembled a strong Mentoring Team to ensure that the candidate will
receive valuable technical training, research experience, and career development. Therefore, this proposed
supplement will provide the candidate a platform for career development while, in parallel, fostering diversity by
reducing underrepresentation in the workforce of scientific research, as outlined in the FOA. New insights
obtained from the proposed supplement will highly complement and enhance the project in the parent grant."

This training grant application seeks continued funding for the Advanced Immunobiology Training Program
(AITP) in the Duke University Department of Surgery. We developed this program to provide aspiring academic
surgeons with a means of obtaining advanced immunobiological training. Our goal is to produce individuals who
understand the immune underpinnings of surgically relevant diseases and, in doing so, create surgeon-scientists
who view immune manipulation as an important adjunct to, and possible replacement for, the surgical
manipulation of tissues. The training program combines the substantial academic rigor of the Duke University
School of Medicine with the Duke Department of Surgery’s longstanding commitment to training the next
generation of surgical clinician-scientists. The program is co-directed by an academic surgeon and a basic
sciences researcher, each with formal expertise in immunology. It offers formal training with a diverse group of
20 mentors, each with expertise in basic, translational, and/or clinical aspects of immunology across a wide array
of applicable topics, including cancer biology, auto-, allo-, and xeno-immunity, vaccinology, and basic
mechanistic immunological pathways. This multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to merge basic and
applied immunobiology with evolving surgical practice. Program participants consist of postdoctoral trainees who
have completed medical school and have already entered surgical residency. At least six individuals will be
trained during the proposed funding period. Based on individual development plans, each trainee chooses to
participate in either a two-year training program, which can include coursework leading to a Master of Health
Sciences degree in Clinical Research, or a three-year training program including coursework in pursuit of a PhD
in Immunology. Trainees who already have their PhD in immunology are offered formal post-doctoral training
opportunities, which are often missing in the training of surgeon MD-PhDs. Guided by their mentors, trainees
have access to a structured didactic curriculum transitioning to a mentored research experience, as appropriate
for each trainee’s prior experience. A robust research infrastructure and substantial departmental resources
support the students, facilitating their conduct and publication of original investigations with complete protection
from clinical service. Specific instruction in technical aspects of immunological investigation is provided, as is
formal mentorship in scientific writing, publication, ethics, and clinical time management. Specific focus will
continue to attract a diverse group of trainees to this highly rigorous program, equipping a select group of
surgeons with a unique and highly contemporary skill set to approach surgical diseases."
10939674,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Ethnic disparities represent a significant problem in modern dermatology, and additional efforts are required
to better understand mechanisms underlying the development of skin diseases in patients with skin of color.
 Inflammatory skin conditions (acne, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa) represent a group of
diseases, which disproportionally impact African American (AA) patients including children. Comparative
transcriptome analyses of the skin reveal higher expression of multiple inflammation-related genes in AA healthy
individuals compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals.
 Regulation of expression of the genes involved in inflammatory skin response occurs at several levels
including signaling/transcription factor-mediated and epigenetic mechanisms. Transposable elements (TEs) are
repetitive mobile segments of DNA that constitute 44%-55% of mouse or human genomes. Inappropriate TE
activation has been implicated in pathogenesis of over 120 human diseases including autoimmune disorders.
 Most TEs are transcriptionally inactive, while their aberrant activation result in a production of double-
stranded (ds) RNA and dsDNA triggering the dsRNA/DNA sensing mechanisms followed by anti-viral immune
response. In the epidermis, UV exposure activates transcription of endogenous retroviral sequences.
Endogenous retroviruses of the HERV-K and W families are significantly upregulated in psoriatic versus non-
lesional skin. However, contribution of TEs to regulation of skin inflammation in AA individuals remain unknown.
 In this Administrative Supplement application to AR078306-03 grant, we will test a hypothesis that aberrant
activation of TEs in epidermal keratinocytes serve as critical determinant driving inflammatory skin response in
individuals with understudied skin types, while pharmacological inhibition of the TE transcription with the
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors provides a novel strategy for management of inflammatory skin
conditions in these individuals. This hypothesis will be addressed via two Specific Aims:
 1. Perform comparative analyses of the landscapes of transposable element expression in human
epidermal keratinocytes between understudied skin types and NHW skin and correlate these data with
gene expression and patterns of active/repressive covalent DNA/histone modifications.
 2. Define the effects of the inhibitors of dsRNA and dsDNA pathways on expression of inflammation-
associated genes in epidermal keratinocytes isolated from understudied skin types in 3D skin equivalent
culture and in experimental in vitro models of skin inflammation.
 The generated outputs from this application will provide novel insights into fundamental mechanisms
regulating inflammation in understudied human skin types, as well as will promote the development of novel
paradigms for management of skin inflammatory responses in humans via modulation of TE activities."

Arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI provides noninvasive quantification of tissue blood flow in physiological
units of ml/100g/min using magnetic labeling of blood water as an endogenous diffusible flow tracer and is one
of the few MRI parameters whose biological basis is known. ASL MRI has primarily been used in the brain to
measure cerebral blood flow (CBF), a key physiological parameter that serves a biomarker of cerebrovascular
integrity and regional brain function with a broad range of applications in basic and clinical neuroscience research
and in clinical care. ASL MRI was originally conceived by our laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, and
we have been responsible for demonstrating many of its technical advances and applications in biomedical
research. Although ASL MRI has been translated to clinical use, commercial ASL MRI technologies have failed
to keep up with research progress.
This Academic Industrial Partnership in response to PAR-18-530 provides dedicated resources to develop,
disseminate, and maintain state-of-the-art ASL MRI acquisition and processing technologies for clinical research
on the Siemens MRI platform, which represents the most widely used MRI system in neuroscience. An Academic
Industrial Partnership is needed because market forces for commercial MRI technologies have been insufficient
to drive the development of state-of-the-art ASL MRI capabilities, yet close collaboration between academia and
industry are required to deliver a streamlined and capability to users. The proposed supplemental research in
response to NOT-AG-23-032
and
specifically focuses on optimizing ASL MRI for use in Alzheimer's disease
related dementia (ADRD) populations.
While a major innovation will be the delivery of an ASL MRI software package featuring state-of-the-art
approaches to maximize sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, and robustness to artifacts to meet evolving
research and clinical requirements for noninvasive quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, next-generation
approaches leveraging deep machine learning are also proposed to achieve higher spatial and temporal
resolution, faster online image reconstructions, and improved robustness to artifacts than are currently possible.
The proposed supplemental research leverages the interdisciplinary expertise of the investigative team to
provide a reliable, reproducible, flexible and user friendly technology for quantifying a key parameter of brain
health and function in ADRD research. The feasibility of the proposed work is supported by our preliminary data
and track record of ASL MRI technology development and dissemination."

 This is an “Administrative Supplement Program to Help Develop Alzheimer’s-Focused NIH Grants” in
response to NOT-AG-23-032.
 Emerging neuropathology findings in neuroHIV as well as gene expression results from our group suggest
a degree of pathogenic similarity and possibly overlap between neuroHIV and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD).
Additionally, the abuse of opioids like heroin, oxycodone and fentanyl and stimulants like cocaine and
methamphetamine (METH) is believed to increase the risk of dementias including AD. However, experimental
evidence of the detrimental interaction of drugs of abuse and AD are quite limited, particularly in the setting of
HIV. To address these knowledge gaps, paralleling and integrating the parent grant, we propose to use in vitro
AD models consisting of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived neural tri-cultures treated with amyloid
β 1-42 oligomers and iPCS-derived tri-cultures harboring isogenic APOE alleles, which are key genetic
determinants of AD risk and to expose them to either an opioid (morphine) or a stimulant (METH) in the same
general design of the parent grant. This Supplement will add AD-focused studies to the experimental design of
the parent grant, that does not propose AD/ADRD-focused experiments.
 This research grant qualifies for the present Supplement under NOT-AG-23-032 because the parent grant
is on a related topic (per NOT-AG-23-032): pathogenesis of cognitive decline in neuroHIV and drug abuse
comorbidity that are believed to share pathogenic mechanisms and be additive to cognitive decline in AD. The
proposed aims closely parallel the parent grant’s with the addition of iPCS models of AD. The parent grant
uses iPSCs-derived neural tri-cultures to model HIV-drug abuse interactions but does not propose AD/ADRD-
related studies. This Supplement will generate preliminary results for an upcoming R01 application focused on
the detrimental interactions of AD with HIV and substance abuse."

TET2 is commonly mutated in adult myeloid malignancies and normal individuals with clonal hematopoiesis.
TET2 plays an important role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs; HSPCs) as
TET2 loss leads to hallmark HSC self-renewal enhancement with skewed differentiation towards monocytic
lineage. Besides DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC), TET2 also catalyzes RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) oxidation. The
catalytic activity of TET2 is required for normal HSPC function, we therefore speculate that the enzymatic activity
of TET2 on RNA also contributes to HSPC regulation. Indeed, TET2 can control chromatin state and transcription
by binding to an RNA-binding protein PSPC1 and modulating RNA m5C oxidization in mouse embryonic stem
cells (mESCs). Stimulated by a recent study discovering a novel mechanism of chromatin regulation through
reversible N6-methyladenosine modification on chromatin-associated RNA (caRNA), we explored the potential
chromatin regulation through the TET2-mediated caRNA m5C oxidation, which led to the following exciting
findings: (i) TET2 oxidizes m5C on caRNAs to hm5C (5-hydroxymethylation ) with long terminal repeat (LTR)
RNAs as the main substrates. (ii) MBD6 is a specific RNA m5C reader protein and NSUN2 is a main m5C writer
protein for caRNAs. (iii) MBD6, via binding to m5C-modified LTR RNAs, recruits H2AK119ub deubiquitylase
complex to mediate local chromatin activation in mESCs. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that TET2
exerts its regulatory function in HSPCs mainly through caRNA m5C oxidation, and deregulation of caRNA m5C-
MBD6-H2AK119ub deubiquitylation axis upon TET2 loss/mutation leads to altered HSPC gene expression and
function. To test our hypothesis, we will: (1) Define the importance of TET2-mediated caRNA m5C oxidation in
the regulation of HSPC function. We will first identify in HSPCs the key caRNAs with altered m5C methylation
upon TET2 loss and corelate with local gene expression. We will then examine the impact of caRNA m5C
deregulation on TET2 deficiency-mediated abnormal HSPC function and gene expression by using Nsun2
knockout (normalize the caRNA m5C increases upon TET2-loss) as well as targeted demethylation (with
dCas13Rx-TET2CD) and methylation blockage (with steric anti-sense oligo) of individual TET2 LTR RNA target.
(2) Investigate the significance of RNA m5C reader, MBD6, in TET2-mediated regulation of HSPC by examining
the impact of MBD6 loss on TET2 deficiency-mediated hallmark abnormal HSPC function and gene expression.
3) Validate the roles of caRNA m5C-MBD6-H2AK119ub deubiquitylation axis in human HSPCs. We will also
investigate whether mutations of TET2 impair caRNA m5C-MBD6-H2AK119ub deubiquitylation axis in HSPCs
from TET2-mutated myeloid malignancies. The sensitivity of TET2-mutated vs. TET2-WT HSPCs to MBD6 or
NSUN2 loss will also be accessed. Success of the proposed studies will gain fundamental knowledge on HSPC
biology by establishing caRNA m5C-MBD6-H2AK119ub deubiquitylation axis as a critical and novel pathway for
TET2-mediated HSPC regulation. These studies can lead to novel strategies to target TET2-mutated HSPCs."

Overlapping pain conditions greatly exacerbate patients’ pain experience. This includes comorbid migraine and
temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), which is associated with a reciprocal increase in their prevalence/severity,
increased risk of chronification, negatively impacting therapeutic outcomes. This underscores this comorbidity
as a significant public health concern. However, little is known of its underlying pathobiology, highlighted by a
dearth of validated animal models and a lack of evidence-based treatment approaches. Investigations into the
underlying molecular mechanisms involved are therefore imperative, with the aim of identifying critically needed
novel treatments that are effective, safe, and with potential for rapid clinical translation. Our recent studies
highlight the important role of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling at S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) in spinal
neuropathic pain models. Further, at the molecular level we also demonstrate that S1PR1 activation engages
neuroinflammatory processes downstream of NLRP3/IL-1β activation. Despite this, the effects of targeting
S1PR1 in trigeminal pain disorders, such as comorbid migraine/TMD, and S1PR1 downstream mechanisms, is
unknown. Our preliminary studies demonstrate S1PR1 is highly expressed along the trigeminal pain pathway,
ideally positioned to modulate neuronal mechanisms related to migraine/TMD. Further, through the development
of a novel preclinical approach to study this chronic comorbidity, we reveal that blocking S1PR1, or S1P
production, prevents and inhibits noxious behavioral and neuronal responses in this novel model. Importantly,
the migraine preventive, topiramate, was ineffective in this comorbid model, translating to reduced efficacy in
comorbid patients. Furthermore, inhibition of the NLRP3 pathway also attenuates noxious responses using this
approach. Together, these data directly link molecular S1P-S1PR1 signaling and downstream NLRP3
mechanisms in the chronic comorbidity of migraine/TMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that S1P-S1PR1 signaling
along the dural-trigeminal pain pathway drives noxious migraine/TMD-like responses in preclinical models of
comorbid migraine/TMD, through a downstream NLRP3-IL-1β inflammatory cascade. Therefore, S1PR1
represents a novel therapeutic target. We will use a multidisciplinary approach, across independent laboratories
with extensive experience in in vivo studies, using behavioral and molecular pharmacology, electrophysiology,
genetics, biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry. In Aim 1 we will establish S1PR1 as a
novel monotherapy target in comorbid migraine/TMD treatment. Aim 2 will determine the role of NLRP3/IL-1β-
driven inflammation downstream of S1PR1 activation in the development of this chronic comorbidity. Validation
of a therapeutic target will have a huge impact on the treatment of chronic comorbid migraine/TMD patients.
Our proposed studies will provide foundational insights into S1PR1/NLRP3 signaling in the development of this
chronic co-morbidity, validating S1PR1 as a target, with functional S1PR1 antagonists a unique monotherapy
approach for intervention, with the advantage that they are already FDA-approved for other indications."

Intra-abdominal infections continue to be associated with a complication rate of more than 20%, even for
relatively simple cases. In addition, the spread of antimicrobial resistance and the growing number of old or
medically unwell patients portends even worse outcomes in the near future. Although technical advances related
to imaging and surgical techniques over the past several decades have expanded therapeutic possibilities,
insight into the management of antimicrobials for these conditions has lagged behind. Although prior work by
the Surgical Infection Society has led to a shortening of this therapy to generally a fixed duration of five to seven
days, it is biologically implausible that all patients require the exact same duration of therapy. Instead,
individualized, precision medicine should result in a better matching of antimicrobial needs with prescription. In
order to achieve such an improvement, an accurate biomarker to assess ongoing infection requiring extended
antimicrobial therapy is needed.
Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels have been shown to be a reliable biomarker for the severity of intra-
abdominal infections, and their normalization over time is associated with a successful outcome, while a
persistently elevated level is associated with failure and need for further interventions. In addition, serial CRP
measurement is now routinely used to diagnose colorectal surgery-related infections including anastomotic
leaks, even before patients become symptomatic. The current proposal is for a planning grant to design and
organize a multicenter, randomized, clinical trial to test the hypothesis that clinicians can use serial CRP
measurements to individualize duration of antimicrobial therapy for intra-abdominal infections, and that this
strategy will result in a lower global rate of complications. The ultimate U01-funded trial will be administered by
the Surgical Infection Society and is projected to include more than 30 enrolling sites with 1958 subjects and
demonstrate a reduction in complication rates from 22% to 17%.
The clinical relevance of this effort relates to the significant reduction in morbidity and mortality for a vulnerable,
infected population. In addition, more precise antimicrobial management in the future will be associated with a
reduction in antimicrobial resistance pressures."

In 2020, over 85,000 people died from drug overdoses in the US, with mortality rates skyrocketing for Black and
Latinx people by 140% and 118%, respectively, given the presence of fentanyl (a manufactured opioid) in the
drug supply. While the national media has focused on opioid-involved deaths among White people, minimal
attention has been given to the disparate morbidity and mortality related to opioid use disorder (OUD) and alcohol
use disorder (AUD) among Black and Latinx people. Although overall prevalence of AUD is similar across racial
and ethnic groups, or in some cases, fewer than White people, there continues to be a disproportionate burden
of illness experienced among under-represented minority (URM) populations, complicated by a dearth of
culturally informed addiction treatment options. Further, with COVID-19, deaths continue to worsen for URM with
SUDs, making it more urgent than ever to study culturally informed treatment interventions for these populations.
This disproportionate illness burden and lack of access to the gold standard in addiction treatment—medication
for addiction treatment (MAT)—has been linked to a host of barriers, based in structural racism, including
inadequate access to technology (a point particularly underscored in the current COVID-19 pandemic), lack of
addiction providers from URM backgrounds, limited education about MAT in URM communities, and an absence
of robust culturally informed harm reduction services in these communities. To tackle the unique challenges of
decreased treatment initiation, engagement, and adherence to addiction treatment for Black and Latinx people
with SUDs, in collaboration with key stakeholders we developed Imani (meaning Faith in Swahili) Breakthrough
in 2017 through a community based participatory process. Imani Breakthrough is a faith-based, person-
centered, culturally informed harm reduction recovery program that takes place in churches. This
program provides an innovative approach to engaging vulnerable groups into SUD treatment, by focusing on the
8 dimensions of wellness (social determinants of health/ SDOH), 7 domains of citizenship, culturally informed
SUD education, and referral to MAT for any FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for treating a SUD. The main goal
of this current study is to develop and optimize methods for increasing access to, uptake of, and engagement in
MAT for AUD and OUD among communities of color. Through a multilevel CBPR initiative and a rigorous RCT
that incorporates elements of choice in participation, we will examine, among participants interested in MAT,
whether adding a Church-based Telehealth MAT option to Imani (Imani + CTM) will improve outcomes for Black
and Latinx people with AUD or OUD compared to Imani + traditional MAT Referral and Linkage (Imani + MAT
R&L) in the community. Individuals who do not choose to engage in MAT will continue in the Imani group program
as usual. Our CBPR process incorporates learning from and partnering with the church and larger community to
increase the community's understanding of AUD and OUD, tackle MAT misconceptions, optimize Imani
implementation, and establish policy recommendations to better serve Black and Latinx with SUDs."

 Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) causes significant symptoms and morbidity due to left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO). Interventricular septal (IVS) reduction procedures for LVOTO
such as alcohol septal ablation and surgical myectomy relieve symptoms and reduce sudden death risk, but
are often initiated late in the disease process due to their peri-operative risk, anatomic constrains,
complications (particularly atrio-ventricular (AV) block) and limited efficacy. Our laboratory has developed an
attractive approach to IVS reduction therapy (SRT) and obtained preliminary large animal data using a high-
intensity ultrasound (HIU) catheter system for the treatment of oHCM, severe LVOTO and its consequences.
HIU has distinct benefits over existing SRT methods in that it:
 1) is less invasive (delivered via a femoral venous approach to the right ventricle (RV)).
 2) selectively ablates the mid-myocardium while sparing the sub-endocardium (which contains the His-
 Purkinje system), thereby reducing risk of AV block.
 3) does not rely on unpredictable anatomic availability of septal perforator coronary artery branches.
 This proposal will further develop HIU IVS reduction by optimizing lesion size and depth, avoiding the
near-field subendocardium, tracking catheter location/orientation/contact, confirming effective formation non-
invasively, and initiating regulatory work to position us for first-in-human studies with a subsequent award. In
Aim 1, we will use acoustic simulations to design, fabricate and validate optimal HIU transducers and catheters
in ex-vivo models. Aim 2 will develop and test several advanced catheter design features that will confirm
transducer-tissue contact, track catheter location in real time, and confirm effective IVS ablation after HIU
sonication is performed. Aim 3 will study fully-developed HIU catheters in-vivo to determine ability to reduce
IVS thickness (and local myocardial mechanics) over 30 day survival.
 The assembled team includes exerts in therapeutic ultrasound, acoustic physics, echocardiography,
cardiac MRI, large animal research methods, research sonographer, and an HCM clinical researcher who will
help with eventual translation of this work to first-in-man studies. Regulatory consultants will ensure that animal
studies are performed in a Good Labor and Practices (GLP)-compliant manner, positioning our group for an
Investigational Device Exemption for an Early Feasibility Study with subsequent awards."
10921819,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, lipid bound vesicles that are secreted by cells. Originally thought to serve
little purpose, EVs have been gaining significant interest due to their promise as therapeutics for a wide range
of indications including skin repair in wound healing and photoaging, and central nervous system (CNS) repair,
including the treatment of neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. As EVs are
found in a variety of physiological fluids including blood, urine, ascites and cerebral-spinal fluid, they also show
great promise as minimally invasive disease biomarkers. However, due to their very small size, many ranging
from 1 μm down to as small as 30 nm, they are exceedingly difficult to study.
Characterization of EVs is critical to understanding function. This characterization includes not only EV size, but
also the complement of molecular cargo that they carry. While some techniques such as nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA) can accurately size particles, they have severe limitations in analyzing their molecular content.
Other methods can determine molecular contents, but typically only as a bulk molecular analysis, preventing the
cross-correlation of the expression of multiple markers in individual EV particles. Most of the current analysis
methods are low throughput, laborious, and/or require significant technical expertise. However, one technique—
nanoparticle flow cytometry (NP-FC)—has the capability to provide researchers with simultaneous
investigation of size and multiparameter analysis of molecular cargo on a particle-by-particle basis.
While most off the shelf flow cytometers are designed for the analysis of cells, many fail to perform adequately
on EVs due to their small size. There is one built for purpose NP-FC on the market. While it has excellent size
resolution, this comes at the expense of throughput (<200 events/sec), multiplexing capabilities (only two
channels), fluorescence sensitivity, and ease of use. All of this leaves EV researchers wanting for a more
comprehensive solution to better enable their critical studies correlating EV properties and reparative function.
Kinetic River has developed a built for purpose NP-FC. Preliminary data shows size sensitivity (via light
scattering) approaching that of the existing NP-FC. We propose to further develop this by improving three
aspects of performance: i) scattering and fluorescence sensitivity; ii) optomechanical design to enable five lasers
and up to six fluorescence detection channels; and iii) user experience, including throughput of up to 2,000
events/sec and a simple, automated size calibration method. In collaboration with EV researcher Dr. Fatah
Kashanchi, we will evaluate the performance of the resulting instrument by addressing a key question in his lab
regarding the reparative function of stem cell derived EVs. If successful, this Phase I will result in an EV analyzer
with an unprecedented ability to fully identify and characterize EVs, paving the way for a Phase II where sorting
capabilities can be incorporated, enabling isolation of EV subfractions for further downstream functional studies."
10921820,"Project Summary
 The goal of this proposal is to continue the development of a synthetic live bacterial therapeutic for
homocystinuria (HCU), an inborn metabolic disorder leading to accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy), an
intermediary of the amino acid methionine. This condition is estimated to occur at an estimated prevalence of 1
in 100,000 to 200,000. The condition may evade clinical detection until specific hallmarks manifest, including
lens detachment from the center of the eye or increased incidence of stroke and other thrombotic conditions.
Petri Bio’s approach is intended to break down methionine in the gut to subsequently reduce systemic levels of
Hcy. Current treatment strategies for pyridoxine non-responsive HCU typically attempt to lower plasma and
tissue levels of Hcy by a combination of restricting dietary intake of the Hcy precursor methionine and dietary
supplementation with trimethylglycine, more commonly referred to as betaine. Both strategies are of limited
efficacy due to a lack of adherence to the diet, and unpleasant side effects from taking betaine (e.g., diarrhea,
nausea, odor). Petri Bio, Inc. employs prokaryotic strains compatible with the human gut microbiome to serve as
expression vectors for therapeutic proteins capable of targeted modulation of metabolic pathways, such as the
methionine cycle. In a search for enzymes capable of impacting methionine levels, we carried out an in silico
screen for potential methionase enzymes in microbial genomic datasets. During the Phase I program, leading
candidate enzymes were subsequently cloned, expressed, and tested in vitro for methionine catalysis
capabilities. The best performing enzymes were engineered for expression in a bacterial strain which is known
to readily engraft into the human gut microbiome. These strains were tested in a genetic model system of HCU
and mitigated systemic levels of Hcy as intended. During Phase II, strains will be additionally optimized and
scaled up to develop a commercial-scale fermentation method. Safety, toxicology, and maximum tolerable dose
testing will be undertaken in a range of standardized tests (both in vitro and in vivo). The lead strain will then be
tested for efficacy in the HCU model employed in Phase I as well as in a murine model of HCU to measure
metabolic effectiveness as well as mitigation of cognitive deficits due to HCU. Pending successful completion
of Phase II, the data will be submitted to the FDA in a pre-IND meeting, the next step towards eventual clinical
evaluation and availability to patients."

The purpose of this Phase I project is to build, integrate, and test a deformable registration pipeline for PRISM
in order to make its markerless registration process more robust. PRISM is a camera-projector surgical
navigation tool (SNT) developed by Illuminant Surgical, Inc. that harnesses advances in computer vision and
sensors to provide surgeons with a seamless navigational experience. Importantly, PRISM addresses three
key barriers to universal adoption of SNTs: high acquisition cost by leveraging low-cost, commodity hardware,
long and invasive registration processes by building a markerless alignment algorithm that uses only surface
topography, and unintuitive visualization by utilizing dynamic projection mapping to display critical guidance
information directly onto the surface of the patient’s skin.
Currently, PRISM has established accurate, consistent dynamic projection mapping capabilities through
phantom and cadaveric testing. PRISM also has a markerless registration process in place that can align a
patient’s preoperative radiological imaging with their intraoperative position to display patient anatomy directly
on top of its subdermal location. However, this registration process currently takes into account only rigid
transformations (i.e., translations and rotations). In order to be significantly more robust and applicable to any
sort of skin-surface changes that may occur in the clinical environment between the time a patient completes a
preoperative scan and undergoes a procedure, Illuminant is focusing on building a deformable registration
pipeline that will be able to account for significantly more planes of disturbance in the skin surface and better
predict how that impacts the subdermal anatomy. Aim 1 of this project will be dedicated to the development of
deformable registration software that can be integrated into the current PRISM suite, and Aim 2 will focus on
testing the deformable pipeline on cadaveric specimens. Aim 2 will also serve as a pilot study for a future
cadaveric validation test that will serve as the basis for clearance from the FDA through the De Novo pathway.
PRISM’s first use case is in spinal surgeries, which are often leveraged to treat spinal degenerative disease
and low back pain––diseases that become increasingly prevalent in patients as they age. Given the growing
popularity of these spinal procedures and the fact that they require a high degree of accuracy, tools like PRISM
that provide intuitive visualization and localization of spinal structures in an easy-to-set up and affordable
manner hold great promise. If funded by the NIH SBIR grant, PRISM would be the first device of its kind to
achieve these capabilities and commercialize."

Role of sex as a confounder in radiation research and its implication in radiological and nuclear countermeasure

acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS). However, sex specific differences in intestinal radiosensitivity have not been
determined. Intestinal epithelium is one of the most radiosensitive tissue due to their high self-renewal rate.
Radiation-induced damage in intestinal epithelium results in loss of crypt progenitor cells, damage of crypt villus
structure resulting in impaired mucosal barrier function, inflammation, bacterial influx and sepsis. Our previous
study clearly demonstrated that repair and regeneration of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is crucial to mitigate
radiation-induced toxicity of intestinal epithelium and thereby mitigation of GI-ARS. We have observed that male
intestinal epithelium is more radiosensitive compared female with higher level of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species production and inflammation. However, these differences are not
related to sex hormone as sex steroid hormones have no direct effect on intestinal epithelium. Mitochondrial
ROS production is directly related to mitochondrial pyruvate transport and oxidation. We observed that
expression of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) and pyruvate oxidation is higher in male intestinal epithelium
than female. Inhibition of MPC significantly reduces the mitochondrial ROS production, minimize radiation
induced epithelial damage and mucosal inflammation and thereby mitigate GI-ARS in both sexes of mice. We,
therefore, hypothesize that mitochondrial pyruvate transport could be a potential target for mitigation of GI-ARS.
In this proposal we will first examine the involvement of mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism in sex specific
differences in ISC radiosensitivity by using pharmacological or genetic modulation of MPC (Specific aim 1). Next,
we will examine weather inhibition of MPC can mitigate radiation induced acute mucosal inflammation (Specific
aim 2) and reduce sex specific differences in radiation induced mucosal inflammation. Finally, we will
characterize the MPC inhibitor treatment with a determination of an optimum dose and schedule for mitigation
of GI-ARS in both male and female mice. We will examine the general applicability of this strategy in young and
aged animals. Determination of mechanism of action and dose optimization study of MPC inhibitor will facilitate
MPC inhibitor as a medical countermeasure against radiation under the FDA’s Animal Rule."

 The Molecular Histopathology and Analytical Microscopy Core (MHAM) is a state-of-the-
art facility, created to provide advanced histopathology and microscopy services to researchers
and clinicians conducting research at LSUHSC, including promising junior principal investigators
(JPIs) included in the second phase of the Center for Translational Viral Oncology (CTVO). The
MHAM provides investigators with access to archival clinical samples, experimental planning
design and imaging studies on the histology and pathology of tissues. MHAM can assist Phase 2
CTVO JPIs in assessing the expression of cell surface and intracellular molecules including viral
proteins, using bright field, and confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry,
immunohistofluorescence, multiplexing, in situ hybridization, and in situ proximity ligation
(DuoLink). The various methods are also used to determine protein and mRNA levels, their
subcellular localization, protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions in the cells and tissues.
Given the translational nature of the CTVO, this Core is led by a trained pathologist, Dr. Luis Del
Valle who, in addition to offering imaging services, also provides histopathological information
and evaluation on patient tissues. The MHAM, works in close collaboration with the new
HIV/Clinical Tumor Biorepository (HCTB), the Department of Pathology, the Louisiana Tumor
registry and different to provide Phase 2 CTVO investigators with access to clinical samples,
which are crucial to investigate the molecular and cellular pathways in virus-induced cancers.
Moreover, the MHAM core assists investigators to develop the necessary imaging and data for
the submission of manuscripts and grants."
10914320,"Wnt signaling is crucial both for neuronal neurogenesis and for synaptic plasticity and maintenance in the 
adult brain. Thus, modulating Wnt-mediated neurogenesis and regeneration represents a promising 
treatment for both central nervous system injuries and neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and 
Alzheimer’s. The canonical Wnt3a signaling pathway plays fundamental role in the medically relevant 
neurogenesis and regeneration and stem-cell renewal. The central event of the Wnt3a pathway is the 
formation of Wnt3a-FZD8-LRP6 transmembrane complex, which initiates and transduces the signal from 
the extracellular side into the intracellular side of the cell membrane. The lack of structural information on 
the intact Wnt3a-FZD8-LRP6 signaling complex or any other complex structure of their homologs greatly 
hinders our understanding of molecular mechanisms for this fundamental pathway and impairs the 
development of Wnt-related regenerative therapeutics. The central goal of this research is to determine the 
structure-based mechanisms of the canonical Wnt3a-FZD8-LRP6 complex by single particle cryo-EM. The 
structural study will allow us to visualize the atomic interactions between the Wnt3a ligand and its receptors 
FZD8 and LRP6, map key structural elements that are responsible for signal transduction, and identify 
potential locations for future therapeutic molecule development. We will also study the structure of the 
Wnt3a-FZD8-LRP6 complex that purified from native source and investigate the basis of Wnt ligand 
selectivity and specificity which is a great puzzle in the field considering there are multiple Wnt ligands and 
receptors. Additionally, we will apply time-resolved cryo-EM studies to resolve the signal transduction 
dynamics and visualize the Wnt3a signal transduction in near real time. The results of this research 
program will not only serve as a foundation for understanding the molecular principles by which other Wnt 
ligands induce signal transduction and related pathological mechanisms in multiple types of diseases 
including cancer, but also pave the way for the rational design of next-generation therapies for 
degenerative diseases and injuries."

The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) seeks competitive renewal of its RCMI - Center for Health
Disparities Research (RCHDR) to continue enhancing NCCU's research ecosystem to develop investigators
who are conducting impactful and cutting-edge research to address health disparities (HD). The Center is an
interdisciplinary effort at NCCU housed at the Julius L. Chambers Biomedical/Biotechnology Research Institute
(BBRI), an institute opened in 1999 to pursue research disproportionately afflicting minority populations in NC
and to diversify the research workforce. In this renewal application, a concerted effort was made to establish an
inclusive, diverse, and representative leadership team for the RCHDR through a group of senior- and mid-level
experienced individuals. The Center will be comprised of four Cores: Administrative Core (AC); Research
Capacity Core (RCC) (arranged into 5 sub-cores); Investigator Development Core (IDC) and Community
Engagement Core (CEC) supporting one basic and one behavioral full biomedical research project plus pilot
studies. The Center will continue to leverage resources and partnerships at neighboring research organizations
in the Research Triangle Park, NC area, with community based organizations (CBOs) in rural and urban NC as
well as the nationwide RCMI network via the RCMI coordinating center to advance the following three specific
aims: (1) Enhance basic biomedical and behavioral HD research at NCCU by conducting two innovative
research projects and instituting a restructured RCC with innovative capabilities to support basic and behavioral
biomedical and population health projects, while enriching our research ecosystem; (2) Prepare and enable all
investigators (including postdoctoral, early stage, research track, tenure-track and tenured) to become
successful extramurally funded HD researchers through coordinated activities of the AC and IDC; and (3)
Strengthen and grow the CEC by fostering existing and new sustainable relationships with CBOs and local health
departments to further extend the community-based network for continued engagement with stakeholders and
dissemination and implementation of HD research findings. In this competitive renewal, we will continue our
focus on basic biomedical and behavioral sciences. Continued support of our RCMI – Center, through
leveraging previous work and the commitment of NCCU to biomedical research, will have profound impact on
the region, while greatly enhancing the research capacity at this HBCU and driving it towards achieving its

10914323,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – Project 1
Black women suffer disproportionately from higher mortality rates of breast cancers (BC) compared to White
women. A driving force in patient outcome is the type of cancer diagnosis and the available treatment options.
We focus on two highly aggressive BC subtypes: the hormone receptor negative basal-like breast cancer (BLBC)
and the under-studied and deadly inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Black women present with higher rates of
BLBC vs. White women, and since highly effective therapies are lacking, survival is poor. The NCI states IBC is
more common and diagnosed in younger Black women, and is often hormone receptor negative. Clearly a need
to conduct more advanced studies into these lethal BCs, and their common themes, is critical for patient survival
and understanding disparate outcomes. Many studies assessing differences in BCs in Black women and White
women examine tumor characteristics; however, etiologic factors that lead to this disparity remain poorly defined.
Our data show Black women have unique immune and stromal cell infiltrate and altered protein levels within
normal breast and tumor microenvironments. Our objective is to identify mechanisms involved in the progression
of aggressive, metastatic BC in Black women as a consequence of stromal effects at the site of the cancerous
lesion. Aim 1 takes advantage of our published studies and pilot expression datasets detailing race and tumor-
subtype specific stromal interactions that identified a focused pathway, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling.
We propose to use groundbreaking tools to identify the cell-type specific source, levels, and spatial orientation
of our signaling pathway molecules within heterogeneous tumors. We will compare these complex data between
Black and White BLBC and IBC tumors. Next, we will measure the expression of an HGF functional
polymorphism, which is highly expressed in Black women. This genetic difference likely results in a significantly
poorer prognosis and survival rate. These data will define subsets of patients who may benefit the most from
HGF/MET therapeutics, as this has been a limiting clinical setback. Aim 2 will then evaluate novel immune
signature contributions to IBC pathogenesis, and test their association with HGF signaling, race, and poorer
outcomes. Aim 3 will use robust experimental studies focused on deregulated DNA repair machineries to
elucidate the mechanistic details of the HGF polymorph and its consequence of HGF over-expression. These
data will significantly contribute to overcoming our lack of understanding of this highly aggressive IBC and provide
a robust signature to identify those at risk for developing IBC. Our team has established research partnerships
that provide access to resources including the Carolina Breast Cancer Study: a unique epidemiologic study from
ethnically diverse patients. By studying BLBC that has distinct immune/wound healing signatures together with
the understudied IBCs, parallels in programs that lead to disparate outcomes may emerge. These pathways will
very likely be targetable. The long-term goal of our collaboration is to understand tumor microenvironment
interactions and their influence on BC disparities to yield discoveries to be translated and lead to new biomarkers."

Obesity is a major risk factor for many of the preventable chronic diseases in the US and is a leading driver to
rising healthcare costs. Of particular concern are young adults transitioning to college as they are more prone to
weight gain compared to their peers who do not attend college. This weight gain is attributed to poor nutrition
and decreased physical activity. Further, young adults attending a Minority Serving Institution (MSI)/Historically
Black College or University (HBCU) experience several unique barriers and facilitators to health promotion
efforts. Addressing health behaviors in the university environment is an opportunity to build resiliency, capacity
and improve health literacy at a critical period in young adulthood. A comprehensive approach is essential for
examining the relationships between the social environment, the community in which a person lives and works,
the individuals' personal beliefs, and physiological factors that may influence the effectiveness of any efforts.
Additionally, leveraging digital technologies has shown success in delivering weight management interventions.
Programs report more significant effect sizes when using behavioral techniques (i.e., tailored feedback, self-
monitoring) compared to education-only internet-based interventions. Thus, to increase buy-in and sustainability,
there is a need to develop and evaluate weight loss interventions for African-American/Black (AA/B) young adults
using culturally tailored and community-based strategies. To address the barriers associated with weight control
in at-risk groups, studies have adapted the intensive Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), including a trial for
AA/Black postpartum women. BeFAB, a novel digital postpartum weight management intervention, was designed
and previously tested. The flagship BeFAB program serves overweight and obese AA women and is culturally
specific, tailored, easy to use, engaging, and branded as a trusted source. With support and consultation by the
original BeFAB MPIs, the proposed research builds on the evidence supporting BeFAB feasibility and seeks to
adapt it to a young adult population and conduct an efficacy trial. This efficacy trial will 1) integrate BeFAB-HBCU
for young adults attending an MSI in Durham, NC, and 2) evaluate its impacts on physical activity-related and
nutrition-related behavior change, weight loss, biomarkers, and stress management outcomes over 12 months.
Phase 1 of this project includes the adaption and development phase. Phase 2 consists of the implementation
and efficacy trial of the intervention. This study will establish a Community Advisory Board (CAB) and conduct a
community-environment assessment in and around the Durham, NC study site to include geo-mapping of assets
and risk factors. The trial conducted at a Durham, NC HBCU will examine effects of the BeFAB-HBCU treatment
(mHealth comprehensive intervention that includes web-based, social media, SMS/text messaging, community
support, and group activities) compared to an attention control/delayed waitlist control group, which includes
general nutrition and physical activity content, on body weight and biomarkers at 4-time points."

investigator development remains an essential component of capacity building for HD research. Multiple
departments across NCCU offer a diverse pool of faculty and scientists who will be targeted and supported for
career development in these areas. The Investigator Development Core (IDC) proposes two specific aims that
complement each other to cultivate researchers focusing on important issues of minority health. SA1: Administer
and employ a rigorous and competitive pilot project program to stimulate new biomedical, behavioral and
population health disparity (HD) research at NCCU: This aim provides funding and administrative support to
allow NCCU researchers (including senior postdocs and research and tenure-track faculty at the instructor and
assistant professor level) to generate preliminary data for subsequent HD grant applications. Funding 4 to 6 pilot
projects per year are proposed for years 6-11. SA2: Provide support for NCCU faculty to develop as basic
biomedical and behavioral population health researchers by (a) Instituting a structured mentoring plan including
the development of an individualized career development program; (b) Enhancing the HD research capacity
through training and ancillary activities such as seminars, workshops, fostering partnerships with neighboring
institutions including other NIH funded Centers for capacity building; and (c) Developing an internal grant review
framework similar to the NIH online grant review process to ensure timely and rigorous review of NCCU grants
before submission to external agencies. IDC will work closely with other cores with the Center including (Internal
(IAC), External (EAC) and Mentoring (MAC Advisory Committee), Research Capacity Core (RCC), and
Community Engagement Core (CEC) co-leads and faculty leads of RCC sub-cores to assure seamless
interaction between pilot awardees and RCHDR resources. Meeting the mission of RCHDR lies in large part on
the success of the IDC fostering the growth of new investigators. The integrated infrastructure of the IDC will

10902694,"ABSTRACT
Head and neck cancer is a complex malignancy with its major anatomical subsite, cancer of the oral cavity
presenting mostly as oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This malignancy ranks among the most deadly and
disfiguring cancers worldwide due to the lack of early detection and effective treatments. OSCC is characterized
by heterogeneous cell states, including cancer stem cells (CSCs), and cells with p-EMT phenotypes which
promote metastasis and therapy resistance. One of the key drivers of OSCC is the Wnt/β-catenin signaling
pathway, where aberrant interaction of nuclear β-catenin with CREB-binding protein (CBP) leads to histone 3
lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and an open chromatin structure. The β-catenin/CBP complex has been also
shown to recruit the histone methyltransferase MLL1, to further promote an open chromatin through
trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Growing evidence indicates that chronic Wnt/β-catenin signaling
gives rise to highly plastic cell states by inducing epithelial cellular senescence, a state of cell cycle arrest that
can contribute to tumorigenesis through an altered gene expression program known as the senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). To examine how Wnt/β-catenin mediated epigenetic activity drives
OSCC evolution, I adapted a syngeneic mouse model of tobacco-associated OSCC using a mouse cell line
4MOSC1, derived from 4-nitroquinoline-1 oxide- (4NQO)-induced tongue tumors. When implanted into mouse
tongues, 4MOSC1 cells generate tumors that recapitulate the human OSCC mutanome. My preliminary studies
show that inhibition of β-catenin interaction with CBP using a reversible, competitive inhibitor, E7386, reduces
isograft tumor growth by 70%, compared to the placebo cohort, providing evidence that the β-catenin/CBP
signaling axis is a major contributor to OSCC in this mouse model. In vitro and in vivo experiments also show
that E7386 treatment leads to decreased MLL1 protein abundance coincident with reduced levels of the open
chromatin mark H3K4me3 at the transcription start sites of genes associated with cell plasticity. Because the
median age of OSCC diagnosis is 66 years, I investigated the impact of age on 4MOSC1-derived OSCC
isografts. Immunofluorescence analysis of tumor isografts from young (10 wks) and aging (64 wks) mice showed
that the older mice had increased CBP and H3K4me3 fluorescence intensity concomitant with increased markers
of cellular senescence. I hypothesize that the β-catenin/CBP/MLL1 epigenetic activity promotes OSCC evolution
through cellular senescence and cell plasticity, which are exacerbated with age. I will investigate my hypotheses
in two aims. Aim 1 will define the association between Wnt/β-catenin epigenetic activity, cellular senescence,
and cell plasticity in OSCC in young and aged mice. Aim 2 will elucidate the functional significance of MLL1 in
Wnt/β-catenin epigenetic activity, cell senescence and plasticity in OSCC and its dependence on age. My project
will address the gap in knowledge of how these newly identified hallmarks of cancer contribute to age dependent
OSCC evolution and identify potential novel therapeutic options for OSCC."

Reconstruction of large and major bone defects remains a significant challenge in modern medicine. The golden
treatment so far has been to use replacement auto or allo-grafts which however struggle with problems of
immune rejection, infection, donor-site morbidity and especially, limited tissue supplies. Tissue regenerative
engineering approach relying on biomaterials to construct artificial “engineering” bone grafts has therefore
become an important field. While many biomaterials are safe, they often require an addition of potentially-toxic
growth factors, stem cells, biologics or drugs to promote healing and tissue regeneration. In fact, there has not
been any clinical success to heal critical-sized (large) bone defects by using only a safe biomaterial scaffold that
is free of seeded stem-cells, exogenous growth-factors, biologics or drugs. Electrical stimulation (ES) has been
shown to effectively promote bone healing and could offer a safe natural stimulation as bioelectrical signals are
ubiquitous inside the body. Several electrical stimulators are available in the market and used clinically for bone
healing. Yet, while external stimulators are not very effective, implanted devices rely on toxic batteries. Several
researchers have attempted to pre-induce electrical signal (i.e. surface charge) on the surface of biomaterial
scaffolds to promote bone healing and avoid the use of battery-based ES. This method however only creates
transient charge that quickly gets neutralized when the scaffold is implanted or directly interfaced with living cells.
In this regard, piezoelectric materials, which can always produce surface charge when subjected to external
force or vibration, appear to be an excellent choice to create a battery-free and remotely controlled electrical
stimulator. Unfortunately, common piezoelectric materials are also non-degradable and/or even toxic, which
renders them not favorable for serving as implanted tissue scaffolds. Here, we propose a novel bionic bone
composite scaffold (BBCS) which is completely biodegradable and can be remotely activated by ultrasound (US)
to electrically stimulate bone regeneration via the combination of piezoelectric self-charging effect and osteo-
inductive ions released from the degradation of beta-Tricalcium Phosphate (β-TCP). This will be the first pure
biomaterial scaffold without using any exogenous stem cells, growth factors, drugs or any biologics to heal a
large bone defect. We design the project with three specific aims; Aim 1 is to assess piezoelectric charge,
mechanical/degradation properties and osteogenesis of the piezoelectric BBCS with US activation in vitro. Aim
2 is to assess healing of critical-sized long-bone defects, using the BBCS and US activation in vivo. And Aim 3
is to study the molecular mechanism to understand the engineering rules on how the BBCS can induce and
enhance osteogenesis of stem cells."

Sarcopenia, a debilitating condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is prevalent
among patients with advanced lung disease associated with poor clinical outcomes, including lower exercise
capacity, reduced health-related quality of life, and increased morbidity and mortality. The development of
sarcopenia is multifactorial, with age, systemic inflammation, chronic hypoxia, and physical inactivity playing
significant roles, particularly among lung disease patients. These risk factors, however, do not operate in
isolation, but within the broader socio-environmental context. This research proposal is anchored in the central
hypothesis that the built environment, including human-made or modified infrastructure, plays a significant role
in the development of sarcopenia among patients with advanced lung disease. The proposed aims of this study
are threefold. Aim 1 is to investigate whether the built environment is associated with sarcopenia in patients with
advanced lung disease. Aim 2 is to identify the barriers these patients face regarding access to nutritional support
and exercise spaces. Aim 3 proposes examining digital access as a promising strategy for delivering food and
exercise programs to this patient group. By combining these aims, this innovative, mix-methods study seeks to
expand our understanding of sarcopenia risk factors and identify potential interventions. Furthermore, this study
will provide valuable preliminary data for future large-scale studies, such as an R01 proposal, which may further
unravel the potential of digital strategies in managing sarcopenia in advanced lung disease patients. It also
contributes to the long-term goal of reducing health disparities in advanced lung disease by employing digital
strategies for nutritional and exercise support."
10933996,"The goal of this project is to investigate changes in the temporal dynamics of cholinergic modulation during aging and the extent to which these changes contribute to alterations of network activity in hippocampal area CA3 that can result in age-related memory loss and cognitive decline, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. A major deliverable of the project is a biologically realistic, full-scale spiking neural network model of hippocampal CA3 that will include simulations of temporal dynamics in cholinergic modulation as a function of animal behavior in the context of encoding and retrieval of behaviorally-relevant information. To achieve this goal, we will acquire a high-quality experimental dataset on neural firing in area CA3 and temporal dynamics of cholinergic modulation using parallel recordings of multiple single units in CA3 and fiber photometry recordings of septo-cholinergic projection neurons or acetylcholine release in the hippocampus in freely behaving mice performing a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Tightly interrelated computational modeling will implement a data-driven, biophysically detailed, real-scale spiking neural network simulation of the CA3 circuit at the level of individual neurons and synapses to investigate encoding and retrieval dynamics during distinguishable behavioral activities requiring the acquisition or recall of information. Experiments in aged mice and quantitative analysis of in silico recordings using data from young and aged mice will generate testable hypotheses on the functional role of distinct neuron types for specific network patterns associated with spatial memory and pattern completion that will allow the mechanistic investigation of the effects of cholinergic modulation on neural activity underlying encoding, storage, and retrieval of memory traces and their changes during aging, the major risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease. The in silico model will also explore quantitative effects of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors on individual neuron types within CA3 and mechanisms such as runaway synaptic modification and structural plasticity possibly underlying the changes in memory encoding and retrieval observed in aged mice. The data-driven biologically realistic CA3 circuit simulations will foster the formulation of novel, specific, and testable hypotheses of memory impairment that will be tested and quantified in closed-loop optogenetic manipulations of temporal dynamics in cholinergic modulation in freely behaving mice that aim at either disrupting or restoring hippocampal network patterns in young or aged mice, respectively. We expect the results of this interdisciplinary collaborative project to advance our understanding of temporal dynamics in the encoding and retrieval of spatial memories, the contribution of fast cholinergic modulation to this process, and how changes in temporal dynamics can result in maladaptive changes on the synaptic, cellular, or network level that may contribute to further memory loss and cognitive decline during aging, preceding and potentially causing the development of Alzheimer’s disease."

Background: Antibiotic overuse results in antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacteria and unnecessary adverse
events including Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI) killing up to 150,000 and specifically 29,000 Americans.
Without intervention these numbers are likely to increase. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is a common area for
unnecessary antibiotic use among hospitalized children following life-saving surgery. The CDC surgical site
infection (SSI) guidelines and the AAP Choosing Wisely Campaign recommend no postoperative antibiotic
prophylaxis for procedures considered low risk for an SSI. Our current stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial
shows antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) teams participating in a facilitation workshop significantly
reduced inappropriate post-operative antibiotic use at the hospital level.
Goal: To disseminate our virtual facilitation workshop to ASP teams and surgeons at 20 US children’s
hospitals to aid to de-implement unnecessary postoperative antibiotic use in children while assessing important
implementation and clinical outcomes.
Methods: For Aim 1, we will adapt our current theoretically and evidence-based facilitation strategy, a
problem-solving approach to integrating evidence-based care, with feedback we received from current study
participants and updated scientific literature for synchronous and asynchronous online workshop. For Aims 2
and 3, we will recruit 20 children’s hospitals that are members of both the SHaring Antimicrobial Reports for
Pediatric Stewardship (SHARPS) Collaborative and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-
Pediatric (NSQIP-P). ASP teams and their surgeon champions will participate in the updated facilitation
workshop. Individuals participating in the workshop will complete pre/post surveys and interviews to assess the
immediate and long-term implementation outcomes including feasibility, appropriateness, guideline integration
through order set changes, and reach across surgical subspecialities (Aim 2). Each children’s hospital will
provide NSQIP-P clinical data three years pre- (2022-2024) and post-intervention (2025-2027). Utilizing these
data, a time-series analysis will evaluate the impact of the intervention on appropriate post-operative antibiotic
use and the rate of SSI and CDIs (Aim 3).
Innovation and Impact: This study is innovative and impactful because it will: 1) combine expertise from
surgeons, antimicrobial stewards and implementation scientists to disseminate an effective de-implementation
strategy to eliminate unnecessary antibiotic use; 2) assess the impact of this strategy on surgeries in children,
an underrepresented group; 3) utilizing a time-series analysis, clinical outcomes (e.g. antibiotic use, SSI, CDI)
important to ASPs and surgeons will be evaluated; 5) collect implementation outcomes that will inform the
dissemination of the strategy to more hospitals; and 6) synergy between two large collaboratives (SHARPS &
NSQIP) that will enhance pediatric ASPs and improve the care of children requiring surgical procedures."

This project focuses on the mechanisms by which IL-10 differentially regulates and promotes
mast cell (MC) hyperplasia, heterogeneity, activation and cellular functions during the
development of IgE and non-IgE-mediated allergic responses to food antigens.
We have demonstrated a key role for the immunomodulatory cytokine IL-10 in driving MC
expansion, activation, and cytokine production during food allergy. IL-10-primed MCs exhibited
enhanced proliferation, IgE-mediated passive anaphylaxis, and the production of TH2-type
cytokines. This suggests a novel role for IL-10 in the homeostasis and function of MCs. However,
the mechanisms by which IL-10 promotes MC activation are not very clear and remain to be
determined. Furthermore, whether these proinflammatory effects of IL-10 on MCs extend to
specific MC lineages, are global in nature, or context-dependent also remain to be examined. This
project combines hypothesis testing and targeted mechanistic approaches to further probe the
mechanisms by which IL-10 regulates MC functions. These include understanding whether IL-10
differentially regulates MC responses to distinct antigenic stimuli, assessment of its effects on
heterogeneous MC subsets, and determination of whether its effects are controlled by the source
cell type. The long-term overall goals are to: 1) identify cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors by
which IL-10 promotes or suppresses distinct MC populations and regulates their effector function
during type 2 inflammatory responses; and 2) examine the systemic and functional local tissue
consequences of regulation of MC expansion and activation by IL-10. Aim 1 will elucidate whether
IL-10 promotes IgE-mediated mucosal MC responses to physiological food antigens such as
peanut and egg allergen and examine its effects on non-IgE-mediated pathways of allergic
sensitization including IL-33-induced anaphylaxis. Whether the effects of IL-10 also extend to
connective tissue MCs will be assessed and the phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles of both
MC subsets will be mapped. Aim 2 will assess the contributions of cell-intrinsic and paracrine IL-
10 to MC hyperplasia and effector function. Aim 3 will identify the effects of source-dependent IL-
10 and determine whether TH2 or non-TH2-derived IL-10 can differentially regulate MC function.
Given the known pleiotropic pathologic and regulatory effects of IL-10 during various T and MC-
mediated immune responses, it is important to further identify the mechanisms underlying the
proinflammatory effects of IL-10 and its ability to promote rather than suppress MC-dependent
responses. As such, these studies are not only relevant to the mission of NIAID but may also
serve to identify precision-based approaches for therapeutic interventions."

The Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) has offered the Embryology Course for 130 years and has been
playing an important role in the training of American developmental biologists. The six-week Course trains a
diverse group of advanced pre- and postdoctoral students for research careers in developmental biology in the
unique intellectual environment of the MBL, where hundreds of scientists come together to train in a variety of
biomedically relevant fields, thereby providing ample opportunities for cross-disciplinary collaborations and
discussions. The Course consists of a series of daily lectures, informal seminars, extended discussions, and
intensive laboratory research experience that cover the paradigms, problems, and technologies of
developmental biology cast within the comparative framework of animal evolution. The 24 students selected
each year are committed to research and teaching careers in the field of developmental biology and are
chosen from a consistently talented pool of diverse national and international applicants. Traditionally, a
number of students from each year’s class later move into positions of leadership in the worldwide
developmental biology community. The teaching faculty are senior/midcareer scientists in the field, who lead
research modules in the course, or who give lectures and lead discussions of individual topics. Six one-week
modules are staffed by two full-time Course Directors, three to four faculty instructors, outside lecturers, and
course and teaching assistants. The themes of the modules change from year-to-year as important advances in
the field occur. The course introduces students to a wide variety of embryonic systems including well-
established models, such as fruit flies, nematodes, zebrafish, mouse, chickens, sea urchins, frogs, ascidians
and planaria and emerging marine invertebrate models such as cnidarians, nemerteans, acoels, crustaceans,
mollusks, annelids, hemichordates and ctenophores. This broad coverage allows for a comparative examination
of developmental strategies and mechanisms that may provide new insights into the evolution of human
related embryonic processes. Hands-on methodologies used to explore development involve surgical
manipulation (cell ablation, tissue grafting) as well as molecular genetic tools (CRISPR/cas9, RNAi,
electroporation) and cell biological approaches (genetic reporters to analyze cell lineage and migratory
behavior). Students apply cutting-edge microscopy and imaging technologies (e.g., confocal imaging, light
sheet microscopy, super-resolution microscopy and 3D time lapse) using state-of-the-art instrumentation,
reagents, and methods. The curriculum covers molecular, genetic, cellular approaches to studying animal
development, stem cell biology, regenerative biology, quantitative biophysical approaches, and genomics, all
taught within a comparative framework of animal evolution. In support of the course, the MBL provides a
unique learning environment, laboratory and support facilities, an animal collection facility, and one of the
nation’s finest research libraries."
10936304,"To effectively address the nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical pain research needs, it is imperative to
prepare an interdisciplinary, diverse pool of well-trained, clinical pain research scientists. To accomplish this
charge, the University of Utah Program to Provide Pain Research Knowledge (UP3RK) mission is to
impart the science knowledge, skills, and core competencies needed by post-graduate, interdisciplinary
Scholars to address the nation’s scientific needs in clinical pain research. UP3RK is situated at the University
of Utah (UU), a rich environment to train interdisciplinary Scholars on clinical pain research in diverse settings.
UP3RK training focuses on our institutional strengths of: 1) nonpharmacologic pain treatment; 2) effective
interventions for pain and co-morbidities, particularly substance use disorders; 3) implementation science, and
4) research with diverse and underserved populations. Annually, UP3RK supports five Scholars—within a two-
year training duration—through dedicated UP3RK Mentors within an innovative, multi-level mentor model
(Mentor Matrix Model) that has proven extremely successful in developing independently-funded investigators
who remain in academic research careers. The UP3RK trains our Scholars in: 1) in our four focus areas, 2)
career development and programmatic skills, and 3) interdisciplinary research skills. UP3RK’s emphasis on
communication, grant writing, and team science at all levels equip our Scholars with key knowledge, skills, and
abilities to advance innovations to improve health for persons with chronic pain and enable a transdisciplinary
approach to team science. To accomplish our mission, we leverage new and existing local training curricula
and national trainings available from the HEAL PAIN Cohort Program. We evaluate UP3RK training activities
through a dedicated evaluation process. UP3RK program objectives are: Objective 1: Recruit and support a
diverse and interdisciplinary group of clinical pain research Scholars with particular emphasis to attract
scholars underrepresented in medicine and clinical research, and those with diverse career paths and clinical
backgrounds. Objective 2: Provide a state-of-the-art training environment and curriculum to develop the next
generation of clinical pain researchers with emphasis on the UP3RK focus areas; nonpharmacological pain
treatments; effective interventions for pain and co-morbidities, particularly SUDs; implementation science; and
research within vulnerable, diverse, and underserved populations. Objective 3: Provide Scholars with
opportunities to improve the impact of their clinical pain research careers and achieve independent research
support within 5 years of completing the UP3RK program by developing career development and
programmatic skills (e.g., technical, operational, professionalism, communication skills) and interdisciplinary
research skills (e.g., working with an interdisciplinary research team). The research environment and novel
training opportunities available through the UP3RK will facilitate achieving these objectives and ensure the
program develops Scholars with the characteristics of successful, independent clinical pain researchers."
10940130,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and its related dementias (ADRD), including Apolipoprotein
(APOEε4) and related variants, have been associated with poorer cognitive outcomes and other adverse health
conditions later in life among individuals without Alzheimer’s. Recent studies have also demonstrated early
developmental changes in brain structures and function in healthy young APOEε4 carriers. Studying genetic risk
factors for ADRD beginning in childhood and adolescence may provide the earliest indicators for individuals who
might benefit from interventions or preventive measures for cognitive impairments and other complex health
conditions that manifest across the lifespan. Heavy alcohol use has been shown to negatively impact brain
development and cognitive functioning throughout the lifespan, with new data suggesting that alcohol abuse is
associated with a 4-fold increase in risk for Alzheimer’s and exacerbates the transition from mild cognitive
impairment to dementia. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is highly comorbid with alcohol use
disorder (AUD), is also associated with approximately 2-fold increase in risk for dementia, with research
suggesting the impact of PTSD on risk for dementia varies based on APOEε4 status. Despite the known adverse
effects of chronic alcohol misuse on brain function, and an association between heavy drinking, traumatic stress,
PTSD, and increased risk of dementia, there are few studies that have specifically examined the relationship
between ADRD in this context. In response to NOT-AG-23-032, which requests administrative supplements for
existing NIH grants to develop a new focus on ADRD, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the
association of genomic risk for ADRD (including and excluding APOEε4, given its large effect size) with
longitudinal measures of brain functioning (i.e., neural connectivity), and the moderating influence of alcohol use
behavior and traumatic stress/PTSD. Data will be drawn from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of
Alcoholism (COGA)’s longitudinal prospective study of adolescents and young adulthood from diverse families
enriched with AUD and traumatic stress (53% female, 28% Black; 8% Hispanic), with detailed assessments of
drinking histories and patterns, diagnostic measures of DSM-5 AUD and PTSD, repeated assessments of brain
functioning and GWAS data. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) will be computed based on summary statistics from a
meta-analysis of 111,326 Alzheimer’s cases and 677,663 unaffected individuals (Bellenguez et al., 2022). Neural
connectivity will be measured with inter- and intra-hemispheric EEG coherence (eyes closed resting state in the
theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (7-12 Hz) and beta (12-28 Hz) frequency bands). Study findings will enhance understanding
of how Alzheimer’s risk factors (genetics, heavy alcohol use, traumatic stress, PTSD, neural development)
typically studied later in life, manifest earlier in the lifespan, and inform interventions or preventive measures that
may help prevent downstream health conditions."

The purpose of this application is to extend and enhance the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)
and the National Study of Caregiving (NSOC) to promote the study of late-life disability, Alzheimer's Disease
and Related Dementias (ADRD), and related care. The overarching aims of NHATS and NSOC are to promote
scientific inquiry into late-life disability and ADRD trends and dynamics, their antecedents and correlates, and
disparities therein, providing the research community with timely, rich, annual data on physical, cognitive, and
sensory functioning and family care. Additionally, NHATS and NSOC provide rich data on the consequences of
late-life disability and ADRD for individuals, families, and society. To achieve these aims in the next five-year
cycle, we will continue the unique key design features of NHATS including annual in person data collection from
a nationally representative sample of older adults (Medicare enrollees) in 2024-2028 (Rounds 14-18) and mixed
mode (web/phone) follow-up with family caregivers participating in NSOC. We will also implement several
innovative scientific enhancements and enrichments of key domains of the disablement process in the NHATS
conceptual framework, including: (1) enriched historical and contemporaneous linkages to residential location,
enhancing access to measures of life course exposures to factors that shape late-life racial and ethnic health
disparities; (2) an expanded accelerometry study to better assess movement, sedentary behavior and sleep
patterns as they related to the disablement process and ADRD; and (3) expanded measures in cognitive and
sensory functioning, residential care settings, and end-of-life care. Extending and enhancing NHATS and NSOC
in these ways will allow important scientific questions to be addressed concerning both shorter and longer-term
in-depth trends and dynamics in disability, ADRD, and related care and will guide efforts to maximize functioning
and enhance quality of life of older adults and the families who care for them."
10923338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in rates of HIV diagnosis and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake
are wide and persist. The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative prioritizes targeting 57 jurisdictions including
7 states and 50 counties with the highest HIV rates in the United States (U.S.). To reduce disparities, precise
detection and forecast of new HIV diagnosis hotspots are required to accurately identify PrEP shortage areas to
inform optimal allocations of PrEP providers who can serve the population efficiently to reduce new infections.
This task relies highly on rigorous studies to examine contextual and structural factors such as community mental
health prevalence and other socio-structural environmental determinants that are likely critical to preventing new
HIV infections. Four inter-related contextual factors that address these gaps are: transportation-based
measures of PrEP accessibility, community mental health prevalence, social capital, and religious
institution environment in an area. We use spatial data science, cyberinfrastructure methodology, and
geospatial statistical analyses to develop novel indicators of these measures by mining data from several
sources including AIDS Vu, The American Community Survey, and other proprietary data sources to accomplish
the following: AIM 1: Create transportation-based measures of PrEP accessibility using Gaussian two-step
floating catchment area (G2SFCA) analysis, at the county and zip code levels, for both urban and rural transport
systems. AIM 2: Use Bayesian spatial analyses to quantify how the distribution of religious institutions
environment, social capital, community mental health prevalence, and transportation-based PrEP accessibility
are associated with: new and late HIV diagnoses rates, and with PrEP uptake at the county, and zip code levels.
AIM 3: Develop an interactive HIV data visualization Web tool to identify HIV hotspots and where to allocate
additional PrEP providers. The Web tool will also display which (and to what extent) socio-structural variables
drive HIV hotspots. We will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the tool through semi-structured interviews
with n = 20 stakeholders (e.g., HIV surveillance epidemiologists, community leaders, and people living with HIV).
Impact: Despite efficacious HIV prevention and care technologies for individuals, HIV-related disparities persist
by race/ethnicity across geography. Successful completion of this research can contribute to ongoing EHE efforts
to reduce 90% of new HIV infections by 2030. Moreover, the rigorous methods used in this project will contribute
to addressing the need for novel approaches for valid and reliable assessments, measures, and estimation of
structural factors that contribute to HIV in high-incidence populations. Our HIV data visualization Web tool is
novel because it facilitates identifying which determinants influence HIV the most and which areas are changing
in response to those variables, which in turn, may help researchers and practitioners identify the “right things, in
the right places, to curb the HIV epidemic.”"
10923602,"Uromodulin (UMOD)-associated chronic kidney disease (CKD), or autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney
disease caused by UMOD mutations (ADTKD-UMOD), is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis and CKD.
Currently there is no targeted therapy. The disease is frequently manifested until adulthood and its prevalence
has been significantly underestimated in Veterans. Moreover, genetic variants in the UMOD locus have the
largest effect on kidney function and CKD progression in both general population and Veterans, and UMOD
genetic variants with unknown function have also been identified with high frequency in hypertensive and
diabetic kidney disease, the most common causes of CKD and kidney failure among Veterans and the general
American population. However, the functional significance of these UMOD variants remains elusive. Thus, our
research on the UMOD genetic variants will contribute to the improvement of Veteran’s health significantly.
 To address the unmet medical needs, by using CRISPR/Cas9 we have developed a mouse model carrying
Umod p.Tyr178_Arg186 del, the mouse equivalent of the most prevalent human mutation. UMOD is primarily
synthesized and secreted by the tubular cells of thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle’s loop. We demonstrate
that defective mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitophagy in the mutant
TALs lead to activation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-mediated inflammation, eventually causing
TAL cell death and renal fibrosis. More importantly, we have discovered a novel biotherapeutic protein,
mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) that can positively modulate mitochondrial quality
control and mitigate STING-induced inflammation and fibrosis in our ADTKD mouse model. Additionally, we
provide compelling data that blockade of MANF receptor neuroplastin preserves mitochondrial function and
that inhibition of the STING pathway suppresses mitochondria-dependent inflammation in our mutant UMOD
cell model.
 The overall goal of this VA Merit application is to develop novel therapies to restore mitochondrial function
and alleviate mitochondria-mediated inflammation by targeting MANF and neuroplastin, as well as STING
pathway in ADTKD. Our overarching hypothesis is that promoting mitochondrial homeostasis is a novel
therapeutic strategy to treat ADTKD-UMOD and CKD. To accomplish our research goals and test our
hypothesis, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team including multiple Co-Investigators and cores with
various innovative technologies and required expertise.
 The proposed study will provide critical insights into the molecular pathogenesis of ADTKD and other forms
of organelle stress-induced CKD, as well as discover mitochondria-targeted and mechanism-based novel
treatments for ADTKD and CKD in Veterans."
10925255,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vaso-occlusive painful episodes (VOE) in sickle cell disease (SCD) are the leading cause of hospitalizations,
emergency room (ED) visits, and missed school, and are associated with an increased mortality rate. There are
no current therapies to relieve vaso-occlusion, with interventions limited to hydration and analgesia. Nitric oxide
(NO), produced by the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine, is a potent vasodilator and exerts pleiotropic effects on
vascular and circulating blood cells, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, down-regulation of adhesion
molecules, and modulation of ischemia-reperfusion injury, all pathways adversely affected during VOE. We have
found that pediatric SCD patients admitted with VOE have depleted plasma L-arginine levels. Additionally, we
have now completed a single-center randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of arginine therapy in
54 children with VOE requiring hospitalization. We observed a reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) by 54% and
signiﬁcantly lower pain scores at discharge in children who received 5 days IV L-arginine therapy every 8 hours
compared to placebo, as well as a clinically relevant trend in reduced length of hospital stay of approximately
17 hours. In pharmacokinetic studies, we found that IV arginine induced a dose-dependent improvement in
mitochondrial function in children with SCD hospitalized for pain. We now propose to extend these results to a
pivotal phase 3 trial of L-arginine for VOE. We hypothesize that arginine is a safe intervention with narcotic-sparing
effects in pediatric SCD patients with VOE that will decrease the time children experience severe pain. Aim 1 of
this study will determine the efﬁcacy of IV arginine therapy on the primary endpoint, time-to-crisis resolution, as
well as total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg) and pain scores in children with SCD and VOE compared to placebo
(Efﬁcacy). Aim 2 will monitor for safety of IV L-arginine (Safety). Aim 3 will characterize alterations in the
arginine metabolome and mitochondrial function in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is impacted
by IV arginine therapy (Exploratory). This proposal will provide essential data for product development and FDA
regulatory approval for use of arginine in SCD. Acute care of patients with SCD and pain in the ED is a neglected
area of research. The results of this study may ultimately lead to change in clinical practice for children with SCD
in both the ED and inpatient hospital wards. ED-based studies and novel therapies that target mechanisms of
vaso-occlusion and pain are needed in SCD."

Cell and gene therapies have revolutionized treatment options for patients with pace of discovery and
implementation accelerating. For example, clinical success of CAR-T cells for hematologic malignancies has led
to use in expanded patient populations and trials targeting for other cancer types. While there are many cell
therapies in preclinical development and clinical trials confidence in their successes is undermined by the
inherent complexity of cells that remains difficult to decipher using existing tools. What is needed is an integrated
analytical platform providing a matrix of readouts that reveal an in-depth real-time understanding of cell
phenotype and metabolism. Such a platform will inform on the therapeutic potential before administration and by
sampling patients will reveal aspects of cell behavior that correlate with efficacy. CellChorus is answering this
need using our platform (“TIMING”) to undertake large scale single-cell analyses to track and characterize
behavior of immune cells over time. TIMING uses sophisticated AI-based software, many years in development,
to track and characterize behaviors of thousands of cells in parallel using time-lapse imaging. Multiple papers
and repeat customers have helped validate our approach to commercialization. Based on users’ demand, we
propose to advance TIMING by (i) developing and optimizing reagents and protocols to identify a suite of cell
surface attributes, (ii) quantify proliferative capacity and (iii) determine metabolic activity before, during, and after
cell-cell interactions. We will integrate these findings with our AI software to provide end users with a simple,
unified assay system to run in their own laboratories on commercially available imaging instrumentation. The
results of this project will be ready-to-use kits to reveal critical immune-biology of cells in critical and challenging
environments. This is predicted to augment translational research and development leading to improvements in
manufacturing and success in patients."
10922529,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental health problems have increased substantially in the last decade, and Hispanic youths’ experiences of
racism and marginalization increases risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Effective
implementation of evidence-based interventions is critical to reduce mental health disparities among ethnic
minority populations and to scale up for dissemination. Cultural adaptation has improved parenting practices
and youth outcomes beyond the original evidence-based parenting interventions and has the potential to
support cultural socialization, which is associated with mental health among Hispanic youth. We have
developed Family Check-Up Online (FCU Online), a mobile, web-based application designed to reduce
internalizing and externalizing behaviors (e.g., depression, anxiety, child problem behavior). The goals of this
Phase 1 study are to culturally adapt the FCU Online for Hispanic parents and to test the feasibility,
acceptability, and commercial potential of the adapted intervention. A community engaged approach will be
employed to identify strategies to improve access to and uptake of the intervention, leveraging community and
cultural resiliency-promoting assets. Promotores de salud, Spanish-speaking community health workers will
provide feedback and pilot delivery the program to meet the needs of Latinx families from diverse
backgrounds. To reach the goals of the study, the following aims will guide this research. In Aim 1, interviews
with parents and community leaders, including promotores de salud, will inform the ecological, cultural
adaptation of the FCU Online modules and the online portal for promotores de salud. In Aim 2, the online
version of the intervention will be adapted using iterative Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles to get usability feedback
from parents and promotores de salud, consistent with best practices designed to adapt interventions in
community settings. In Aim 3, using mixed methods, researchers will assess feasibility, accessibility, and
commercial potential of the adapted FCU Online. The team will recruit 10 Hispanic families and 5 promotores
de salud to participate in a pilot trial. Feasibility and accessibility will be assessed according to quantitative
benchmarks, including technology usage data, a telehealth usability survey, and a consumer satisfaction scale.
Qualitative feedback will assess the barriers and facilitators of using the adapted FCU Online. Qualitative and
quantitative data will be integrated for analysis. Findings from this study will inform a future Phase 2
randomized controlled trial to test effectiveness in a real world setting to scale up dissemination of the adapted
FCU Online among Spanish speakers. This research has potential to reduce lifetime risk for depression,
anxiety, and externalizing behaviors among Hispanic youth by improving parenting practices and supporting
cultural socialization."

This 3rd Technology Operations Core (TOC3) complements TOC1 by diversifying the ALS-ENABLE
technology base to maximize flexibility in this now transformative era for structural biology. Artificial intelligence
(AI) has revolutionized solving the phase problem, and we will not only make these new structure prediction
tools accessible to our User community, but also other AIs that benefit our workflows, such as object location of
sample loops and crystals, diffraction image interpreters or variational auto encoders for modelling protein
domain motions. These will be put to use once they are proven effective. For example, we expect to enable
efficient yet unattended in-situ serial data collection direct from crystallization trays by training now mature and
off-the-shelf AI technology to locate diffraction-quality crystals in their growth drops. If successful, even a
modest improvement in hit rate will revolutionize serial data collection using our in-situ goniometer. This in-situ
capability also completes a chain of diagnostic tests of the sample preparation process, allowing our Users to
understand the origins of poor diffraction and focus their efforts appropriately. This diagnostics chain leverages
the capabilities of TOC1 micro-focus, TOC2 solution stability, and TOC4 mapping molecular interfaces.
 Our uniquely accommodating robotics solution with broad pin compatibility will get a capacity upgrade to help
ease the transitions our User community will have to make from synchrotron to synchrotron as APS and then
ALS undergo long shutdowns for major upgrades. We will upgrade our X-ray optics to match the properties of
the ALS-U source. We will also upgrade robotics to provide remote access data collection at non-cryo
temperatures, ranging from -20C to +50C, making these valuable multi-temperature tools accessible to a
geographically diverse User community. Functional studies at these temperatures will be assisted by rolling out
state-of-the-art difference-data analysis software, such as PanDDA, as part of beamline workflows. By explicitly
supporting difference data analysis our users will have access to state-of-the-art technology for visualizing
weak yet critical difference features, such as low-occupancy ligands and functionally-relevant conformational
shifts. And because fragment screening is a critical tool for the bioscience community to quickly respond to an
emerging health crisis, we will support as well as document best practices such as DMSO tolerance testing
in our ALS-ENABLE protocols as well as foster collaborations between user groups with access to advanced
yet shareable sample preparation tools such as fragment libraries and acoustic drop liquid handlers. Rather
than leave users to their own devices to organize and analyze their data, we will deploy ISPyB/SynchWeb, the
world’s most heavily used LIMS for structural biology data. Tools for merging multi-crystal data for improved
data quality that performed well in our global challenge data set competition will be deployed under this
framework. This will not only make cross-synchrotron data analysis available in one place, but maintain a level
of familiarity to ease the transition of our Users to and from other synchrotrons. We group our aims by the
mathematical operations they entail: adding data together to improve signal (Aim1), modulation of the sample

Technology Operations Core 4 (TOC4) integrates the method of X-ray footprinting mass spectrometry (XFMS)
into the ALS-ENABLE resource, providing resource users with a solution state structural biology method that is
highly complementary to macromolecular crystallography (MX, TOCs1&3) and small angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS, TOC2). XFMS is an in situ hydroxyl radical (•OH) labeling method based on well-established solvent
accessibility protocols similar to Fenton chemistry and hydrogen deuterium exchange, sharing the same liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) data collection platform. The method provides residue-level
structural information on proteins and/or nucleic acid in the solution state, and can be used for time-resolved
studies and on complex mixtures of proteins in solution. Because of its versatility, the method has been especially
valuable in obtaining structural and kinetics information that is highly complementary to the information obtained
using the other more well-known structural biology methods such as MX an SAXS. The XFMS method has a
vibrant, growing user base, has advanced substantially over the previous decade in automation and throughput,
and is now close to the same level of routine use as MX and SAXS. In the last four years in particular, the
instrumentation developed as part of a current NIGMS R01 award has significantly advanced the throughout and
accessibility of the method for the larger biomedical community, including the development of an automated
liquid sample delivery system, a remote-accessible beamline control interface, and automated LCMS data
analysis. Through TOC4, we will make available our automated, high throughput, and hybrid spectroscopy-
XFMS platform to ALS-ENABLE users through remote access, onsite and mail-in options. We will integrate
information about XFMS and access to databases through the ALS-ENABLE website (als-enable.lbl.gov) so that
users will have a single front-facing portal through which to learn about and access data from all the structural
biology beamlines at the ALS. The integration of these technologies within the ALS-ENABLE resource will
extend the structural biology capabilities at the ALS such that even more challenging biological systems can be
studied, thus providing the national biomedical community with a powerful and increasingly versatile new tool for
investigation of macromolecular assemblies."
10927300,"ABSTRACT (Project 2) 
There is an urgent need to discover improved therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which 
require a better understanding of mechanisms underlying development and recurrence. Chronic inflammation 
is a feature and an independent risk factor for PDAC. Interactions between immune cells, cancer associated 
fibroblasts (CAFs), and cancer cells can promote PDAC development and progression. However, little is 
known about how immune cells or immune cell-related signals affect PDAC development. Our long-term goal 
is to identify signaling nodes that facilitate the crosstalk between immune cells, cancer cells and CAFs to 
promote PDAC progression. In healthy subjects, IL-22 is expressed by immune cells while its receptor, IL 22RA1, is selectively expressed in non-immune cells. IL-22 and IL-22RA1 expression are both elevated in 
PDAC, but little is known about the role of this signaling axis in PDAC. We have recently demonstrated high, 
heterogeneous expression of IL-22RA1 in human and mouse PDAC. Importantly, high IL-22RA1 expression is 
associated with poor prognosis of PDAC patients. Furthermore, we showed that IL-22RA1high cells in PDAC 
have cancer stem cell properties, including high tumorigenicity in vivo. We found that IL-22 stimulates IL 22RA1 expression through STAT3 activation in PDAC cells, and postulate that this positive feedback loop 
enhances stemness and tumorigenicity of PDAC cancer cells. Thus, IL-22RA1/STAT3 signaling might provide 
a therapeutic target to treat PDAC with high IL-22RA1. We will use different mouse models of PDAC to study 
the effects of genetic deletion of IL-22RA1 in acinar cells or PSCs on PDAC growth, metastasis, and stemness 
in vivo. We will use novel, multi- dimensional analysis methods to analyze if inflammation drives 
carcinogenesis via IL-22, IL-22 expression in immune cell populations in PDAC mouse models and test 
therapeutic benefit of blocking IL-22 signaling in PDAC using pharmacologic and genetic approaches. We will 
determine the expression and role of IL-22/IL-22RA1 axis in human PDAC. Using primary human pancreatic 
ductal epithelial cells with defined PDAC genetic driver mutations, we will study the contribution and regulation 
of IL-22/IL-22RA1 signaling in human PDAC development. 
Our proposed studies will novel insights into how genetic drivers and inflammation orchestrate 
functional connection and communication between immune and non-immune components in PDAC. Further, 
we will gain mechanistic understanding of how (1) immune cell, CAF, and cancer cell interactions mediated by 
the IL-22/IL-22RA1 axis lead to PDAC development and (2) inhibition of the IL-22/IL-22RA1 signaling axis 
provides a therapeutic strategy that targets cancer stemness, a major factor in therapy resistance and the 
dismal prognosis associated with PDAC."
10927316,"ABSTRACT (Core C)
A central focus of our program is understanding the roles of specific cell types, including immune cell 
populations, throughout the initiation, development and spread of PDAC in mouse models and in humans. A 
key aspect of this effort is to define the frequency, spatial relationships and activation states of cell types within 
tumors, and to learn how these parameters change over time and in response to therapy. Additionally, while 
each project focuses on a different aspect of PDAC, a comprehensive understanding of the role of the epithelial 
compartment and the immune system in PDAC will require simultaneous analysis of each of these cell types in 
multiple tissues. To achieve these goals, we will use CO-Detection by indEXing (CODEX), a new method 
generated by Dr. Nolan’s group at Stanford. CODEX will allow cytometric imaging of tissue sections with dozens 
of antibodies. CODEX data from this Core can then be linked to complementary data from CyTOF and scRNA Seq used in individual projects. The Specific Aims of Core C for human and mouse pancreas studies are:
1. Provide CODEX processing to investigators, including staining, imaging and quality control
2. Provide CODEX analysis, including antigen clustering, cell type annotation and neighborhood mapping
3. Develop new antibodies and reagents for CODEX in consultation with P01 investigators
4. Develop standard workflows for tissue procurement, processing, storage and retrieval in partnership 
with the human pancreas tissue core (Core B).
Projects 1, 2 and 3 will specifically use the CODEX core platform for studies of both mouse and human tissues. 
Core C will work closely with the Human Tissue Core B to ensure appropriate human tissue preparation to 
support CODEX analysis. Thus, Core C will provide services technically difficult and not available in most 
laboratories, materials not available commercially or impossible to obtain elsewhere, and services more reliably 
and cost-effectively performed than if performed in an individual investigator’s laboratory. This CODEX Core 
would be new, and unique at Stanford."

10934048,"FLOW CYTOMETRY SHARED RESOURCE - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Flow Cytometry (FC) Shared Resource was established in 2004 to provide ready and affordable access to state-
of-the-art multi-parameter cell analysis and sorting capabilities. This facility is comprised of a large number and
variety of flow cytometry instruments that quantify the fluorescence of individual cells, typically following staining
with specific antibodies. Flow cytometry has become an important tool in cancer research for many different
purposes. Some important applications include the immune profiling of tumor microenvironments and the
phenotyping of cancer cells. Cell sorting by flow cytometry is critical for the purification of cells for genomics,
proteomics, metabolomics, or the isolation of tumor stem cells. This institutional resource serves the entire Yale
School of Medicine (YSM) campus, including Yale Cancer Center (YCC), and thus has a critical mass of users
supporting these large and expensive instruments.
During the most recent funding period, 187 laboratories have used Flow Cytometry. One hundred and seventeen
(53%) are YCC members. This Shared Resource was most widely used by the Cancer Immunology (CI),
Genomics, Genetics and Epigenetics (GGE), and the Cancer Signaling (CSN) Research Programs. The facility
also offers consulting on experimental protocols as well as some wet-bench services that can be performed on
a fee-for-service basis for clinicians who do not have their own laboratory staff. These include sample
cryopreservation, sample staining and data acquisition and/or data analysis. This has proven to be helpful for
clinicians who wish to have correlative studies associated with their clinical trials.
Flow cytometry has multiple applications in cancer research. For example, as the pace of research into cancer
immunology and biologic therapies increases, defining the functional and phenotypic heterogeneity of mixed cell
populations will continue to be a critical technology in cancer research. Flow cytometry is not only essential for
cancer immunology research, but also empowers numerous other types of studies such as oncogenesis, cell
signaling events, preclinical models, the assessment of therapeutic efficacy, gene editing using CRISPR and of
course, cell sorting for genomic and RNA sequencing. Clearly, flow cytometry is vital to several programs within
YCC.
The Specific Aims of the Flow Cytometry Shared Resource are: 1) to provide flow cytometry services that are of
high quality, readily available, and at reasonable cost; 2) to educate the YCC community on the applications of
flow cytometry in medical research; and 3) to collaborate with YCC investigators in the development of new
applications."
10931236,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifaceted autoimmune disease characterized by immune
dysregulation, disabling symptoms and progressive organ damage. Recognition and early treatment to prevent
tissue and organ damage is challenging, as signs and symptoms of high disease activity and clinical disease
flare are captured after their occurrence. Despite clinical instruments of disease activity and improved
treatment regimens to temper chronic inflammation, SLE patients may experience an average of 1.8 disease
flares annually. Current treatment for ongoing heightened clinical disease activity and disease flares, which
must be done in reactive, rather than proactive, fashion, typically relies on rapidly acting, toxic agents such as
steroids. Earlier identification and proactive treatment of heightened clinical disease activity and imminent
disease flare might prevent significant organ damage and improve the quality of life for patients with SLE.
 Our scientific premise is that alterations in SLE-associated immune pathways underlie ongoing clinical
disease activity and future disease flare. Traditional biomarkers incorporated in clinical disease activity
measures, including anti-dsDNA autoantibody and complement components, are not necessarily the earliest,
nor sufficient, biologic signals of worsening disease. Using a multi-analyte approach, we leveraged our recently
completed SBIR Phase I/II study to determine that lupus patients, prior to disease flare, have additional
immune dysregulation of multiple and varied immune pathways. This information was transformed into a Lupus
Flare Risk Index (L-FRI) that reflects the pre-flare immune status in lupus patients who go on to flare. Lupus
patients with ongoing heightened clinical disease activity are also at risk for permanent organ damage. We
therefore leveraged our initial studies to evaluate immune dysregulation in lupus patients with current low
disease activity vs. active clinical disease. Again, we observed alterations in multiple and varied immune
pathways, but in a different manner than what occurred prior to disease flare. This led us to design a Lupus
Disease Activity Index (L-DAI) that correlates well with clinical disease activity measures.
 Our proposed late stage research in this SBIR SB1 CRP study is to leverage clinically well-characterized,
prospectively collected samples from ethnically diverse patient cohorts, including community settings, to
validate our algorithms. Aim 1 will focus on validation of our innovative L-FRI in SLE patients during pre-flare
vs. nonflare periods based on their future clinical disease activity. Aim 2 will focus on validation of the L-DAI in
SLE patients with concurrent low vs. active disease. In addition, we will leverage SBIR SB1 CRP technical
assistance funds to develop advanced clinical adoption (Aim 3) and reimbursement (Aim 4) strategies for our
L-FRI and L-DAI tests. The L-FRI and L-DAI tests are a game-changer in the lupus space by allowing
proactive disease management."
10932738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease largely devoid of targeted therapy due
to the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. Due to this, conventional chemotherapy is the
only systemic pharmacological option used to treat TNBC patients. However many women do not have a
lasting response to this treatment alone particularly in the later stages of the disease. Therefore, the
identification of agents that can selectively target molecularly defined subtypes of TNBC would be beneficial.
To this end, we have pioneered the screening of natural product extracts for TNBC subtype-selective
constituent, resulting in the identification of the macrocyclic diterpenoid yuanhuacine. This proposal thus
focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which yuanhuacine mediates TNBC subtype-selective
cytotoxicity and which pharmacophores in the structure modulate such activity. This work will test the central
hypothesis that the epoxide on carbon 6,7 of ring B on the macrocyclic diterpene ester skeleton is pivotal in
mediating potent and selective cytotoxicity against the basal-like 2 (BL2) subtype of TNBC through a protein
kinase C (PKC) dependent pathway. Preliminary studies suggest that the PKC βII isozyme of PKC may
mediate the sensitivity of BL2 TNBC cells towards yuanhuacine. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether
PKC βII isozyme expression is both necessary and sufficient for these activities, and how the compound alters
PKC kinase activity in both sensitive and resistant cells. Previous studies comparing the potency of
macrocyclic diterpenoids that lack the epoxide group on carbons 6 and 7 to those that do, demonstrate a
significant loss in cytotoxicity potency when compared to the epoxidated derivatives. In Specific Aim 2, we will
define additional structural pharmacophores that are critical to mediating the potent and selective cytotoxicity
against the BL2 TNBC cells and further establish the importance of the epoxide group by comparing the
activity of a series of established and newly synthesized derivatives representatives of the distinct subclasses
of macrocyclic diterpenoids. Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide insights into an
unanticipated druggable oncogenic pathway and a companion drug to advance the development of targeted
therapies against TNBC. Additionally, the integrative approaches proposed here will serve as a platform for me
to obtain new mentored career training and pave the way to establishing a sustainable research program at a
primarily undergraduate institution (PUI) conducive to excellence in biomedical research."
10937131,"One third of all birth defects are associated with craniofacial malformation including lack of suture closure, cleft
palate, or failure of skeletal formation. Progress in understanding the origin of these diseases depends on
understanding the cellular and genetic mechanisms that produce normal craniofacial patterning. The zebrafish
is an excellent model system for studying the process of craniofacial development, as it is possible to observe
all stages of jaw formation, from development of cranial neural crest (CNC) cells, which migrate into the
pharyngeal arches and differentiate into skeletal cells, all the way through generation of bone and cartilage in a
few days. The ability to generate genetic mutations and transgenic lines in zebrafish allows for precise
dissection of molecular mechanisms involved in craniofacial patterning. Histone deacetylases (Hdacs) are
enzymes that function to regulate transcription during development. Human disorders and animal models
demonstrate that Hdacs are involved in the development of the CNC-derived skeleton. For example, Cornelia
de Lange syndrome, cleft palate disease, and Fetal Alcohol Syndromes all involve defects to CNC cells or
derivatives, and are associated with abnormal Hdac function. The long-term objective of this study is to reveal
how individual Hdacs interact with known and novel gene pathways to regulate specification, migration,
differentiation, and activity of CNC cells and their derivatives to pattern the craniofacial skeleton. The proposed
studies will focus on investigating the function of Hdac1 and protein complexes involving Hdac1 in zebrafish,
using data generated using RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq and mutant lines with unknown craniofacial phenotypes
(i.e. phf21aa;ab, zmym2) to test the hypotheses that Hdac1 patterns post-migratory CNC cells through
regulation of patterning genes and growth of cartilage and bone. Using a chemical inhibitor screen, this study
will further elucidate the potential roles of other Hdacs (i.e. Hdac3, 6, 8) in development of the jaw skeleton in
the zebrafish model. Overall, the approach will include 1) investigation of genes and chromatin modifications
associated with patterning and skeletal development in hdac1 mutants 2) Analysis of the roles of factors in the
chromatin modifying Lsd1-CoREST-Hdac1 and Braf/Hdac complexes in skeletal development, 3) A reductive
strategy to test specific Hdac inhibitors applied to embryos (e.g. Romidepsin, TMP-195) in which the role of
particular classes or individual Hdacs on craniofacial development will be established, leading future reverse
genetics projects to generate novel Hdac mutants using CRISPR-Cas9. Research will involve undergraduates,
with a goal of exposing students to research design and to train them in critical thinking, molecular techniques,
data analysis, and communication skills."
10937188,"Summary/Abstract
Developing better therapies for complex diseases necessitates comprehensive understanding of intricate
pharmacogenomic mechanisms. The explosion of multi-omic data and biomedical literature has enabled
systematic explorations in pharmacogenomics; however, it is accompanied by substantial computational hurdles.
Addressing this challenge, the PI’s laboratory has been pioneering state-of-the-art machine and deep learning
models that comprehensively integrate diverse types of biomedical data to study disease biology, optimize
treatment strategies, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes. We successfully applied our computational
frameworks to diseases such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, hematopoietic disorders, and viral infections,
yielding biologically meaningful insights. Over the forthcoming five years, the R35 award will augment the breadth
and depth of our endeavors through three distinct yet synergistic themes: 1) predicting effects of therapies on
diseased cells, 2) inferring pharmacogenomic interactions between genes and drugs, and 3) developing
accessible computational resources. Specifically, Theme 1 will devise advanced deep learning models that
integrate multi-omic information – ranging from genetics to transcriptomics and proteomics – to predict the
molecular effects (e.g., inhibition of critical genes or pathogenic pathways) and phenotypic responses
(suppression of cell activation, viability, etc.) induced by various genetic and chemical perturbations in disease
models. By leveraging the emerging large language models, Theme 2 will dissect an extensive corpus of
published literature to construct the landscape of pharmacogenomic gene–drug interactions. These interactions
will illuminate the mechanisms of actions and molecular intricacies that govern treatment efficacy in the context
of diseases. Theme 3 will create accessible computational resources that empower the utilization of cutting-edge
computational methods and emerging genomic/pharmacogenomic profiling technologies. Completion of the
proposed research will establish resources that facilitate cost-effective prioritization of therapeutic targets and
agents for follow-up biological and clinical investigations, and evidence-based strategies for drug repositioning.
Our research is innovative as it formulates a sophisticated computational framework that integrates deep learning
machineries tailored to individual data modalities. The accessible tools will promote FAIR-ness (Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of relevant data. The framework established through this project
is adaptable to computational methodologies and profiling technologies arising in the future, and broadly
applicable across complex diseases. The PI is uniquely suited to lead the proposed research for his
transdisciplinary experience in bioinformatics, engineering, and biomedicine, along with synergistic
collaborations with wet-lab and clinical scientists in a vibrant translational research environment. Finally, the
project infrastructure will support the PI’s long-time commitment to mentoring trainees from diverse backgrounds,
channeling groundbreaking research findings into educational endeavors, and serving the research community."
10937195,"1 Cell differentiation is accompanied by morphological changes and driven by differential
 2 gene expression through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In the post-
 3 meiotic spermatids, however, transcription is repressed, and yet the spermatids need to
 4 undergo morphological changes to gain motility and fertilization competence. This process,
 5 called spermiogenesis, depends on post-transcriptional mechanisms. As an extreme example,
 6 spermiogenesis in the nematode C. elegans (also called sperm activation), takes place rapidly
 7 and is independent of both transcription and new protein synthesis. This process transforms
 8 spherical spermatids into polarized and motile spermatozoa with pseudopods and allows the
 9 sperm to be fertilization competent. How the spermatids sense and process the signals to
10 initiate spermiogenesis is not well understood. The nematode C. elegans exist primarily as self-
11 fertilizing hermaphrodites, and males that can mate with hermaphrodites. Sperm activation is
12 initiated by independent but converging signaling pathways in hermaphrodites versus males.
13 These pathways involve secreted proteases, transmembrane proteins, kinases, iron
14 transporters, and other effector proteins. Not all the genetic regulators are known; how these
15 regulators work together to induce cellular changes during activation is not well understood. The
16 long-term goal of this application is to understand the genetic regulation of gamete development
17 and gamete functions. The proposed work here takes advantages of unique mutant alleles
18 isolated in a forward mutant screening for genes that regulate gamete function during
19 fertilization. Two temperature-sensitive mutant alleles, as47 and as48, both show a sharp drop
20 in fertility and defects in sperm activation in vitro. The allele as47 affects a gene encoding a
21 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase. The objective of this application is to investigate the molecular
22 mechanism of the regulation of sperm activation by phosphatases and to identify additional
23 regulators. This objective will be broken down to three aims: 1), investigate the mechanisms by
24 which the affected phosphatase in as47 regulates sperm activation. 2), investigate the role of a
25 related Ser/Thr phosphatase in sperm activation. In both aim 1 and 2, genetic analyses and a
26 cellular biological approach will be used to dissect the relationship between these phosphatases
27 and known pathways of sperm activation. 3), identify and explore the function of the gene
28 affected in as48. This proposed work will lead to a better understanding of the genetic regulation
29 of sperm development/differentiation. The knowledge gained from this application will be
30 applicable to other developmental contexts and to high-order organisms.

allogeneic HCTs) and >100 immune effector cell therapies. The MSBCC has demonstrated a strong track
record of BMT CTN productivity and possesses significant strengths to accomplish BMT CTN strategic
goals. In terms of scientific leadership, Dr. Levine will be Steering Committee Chair starting in 2024. The
MSBCC has provided extremely strong accrual to BMT CTN clinical trials, with a proven ability to enroll
large numbers of under-represented minorities. It possesses extensive expertise in transplant for non-
malignant blood diseases (especially sickle cell disease). Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a high
priority for the BMT CTN and the MSBCC benefits from the successful collaborations of the Mount Sinai
Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) which now houses a large natural history database
(>6000 patients) that has enabled a highly innovative, biomarker-based approach to this major
complication of allogeneic BMT. As shown in our preliminary data, steroid-refractory (SR) acute (a) GVHD
remains an unmet medical need despite the fact that it has become less common and less lethal. Nearly
half of patients with SR-aGVHD do not respond to ruxolitinib and these patients have a dismal 100 day
survival rate of only 20%. Remestemcel-L, a bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)
product has shown significant efficacy with virtually no toxicity in treating SR-aGVHD in children and
adults. Although an earlier MSC product, Prochymal, did not prove effective for adults with SR-aGVHD,
its lack of potency was a major contributor to its poor efficacy. The improved product, Ryoncil, passes a
potency assay before release; this improved, quality controlled product is now available to be tested in a
clinical trial. Our proposal shows that third line treatment with this new, high potency product increases
day 100 survival of patients with SR-aGVHD to greater than 60%. We thus propose a clinical trial to
improve day 100 survival in patients with acute GVHD resistant to both steroids and a second line of
treatment. To accomplish this goal we propose to treat patients in need of a third line of treatment with
high potency remestemcel-L (Ryoncil). Our proposal is supported by the manufacturer, Mesoblast. Our
specific aims are: (1) To participate vigorously in BMT CTN clinical trials and committees and (2) To treat
resistant GVHD with high-potency remestemcel-L to improve survival.
RELEVANCE: The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network conducts clinical trials to
improve outcomes for patients facing life-threatening diseases. The Mount Sinai BMT CTN Consortium
will advance the mission of the BMT CTN by enrolling patients onto BMT CTN clinical trials and providing
scientific leadership to the BMT CTN. The proposed clinical trial will mitigate graft-versus-host disease,
the most serious BMT complication."

Background: Gamification is the use of game design elements such as points and levels in non-game
contexts. Gamification is used commonly within workplace wellness programs and digital health applications;
however, its effectiveness has been limited. A significant opportunity is to incorporate principles from
behavioral economics, which have been effective in informing intervention designs that achieve sustained
improvements in health behavior by addressing the ‘predictable irrationality’ of humans. Our group has
conducted two successful clinical trials using gamification and either collaboration or competition to increase
physical activity in other settings. We have conducted three pilot studies with Veterans to tailor these
approaches to their specific needs and experiences.
Significance: Higher levels of regular physical activity are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and mortality. Despite this, more than half of Veterans do not achieve
enough physical activity to obtain these benefits.
Innovation and Impact: This will be one of the first clinical trials to incorporate behavioral economic principles
and social incentives within the design of gamification to increase physical activity among obese Veterans with
hypertension. It will also be one of the first to directly examine the impact of these interventions on clinical
outcomes associated with increased physical activity and examine cost-effectiveness To improve scalability
and decrease burden on Veterans, the entire study will be conducted completed remotely including enrollment
and interventions. Moreover, we will use state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning techniques to
examine personalization of interventions.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification with collaboration or competition to
increase physical activity . Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification to improve clinical outcomes.
Aim 3: To conduct a qualitative process evaluation and implementation analysis to inform implementation
efforts within VA. Aim 4: To conduct a quantitative evaluation of Veteran characteristics related to
demographics, past experiences, social networks, and other factors to identify heterogeneity in treatment
effects. Aim 5: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the gamification interventions.
Methodology: Obese Veterans with hypertension will be enrolled into a three-arm randomized, controlled trial
comprised of a 6-month intervention and a 3-month follow-up. Wearable devices will be used to passively
monitor physical activity levels. Clinical outcomes will be captured by digital weight scales and blood pressure
cuffs through video conferencing. Interventions will be deployed using Way to Health, a technology platform
that we have demonstrated is feasible to use within the VA Health System. Outcomes will include physical
activity in steps (primary), minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (secondary), changes in clinical
outcomes of weight and systolic blood pressure (secondary), change in minutes of sleep (exploratory), and
cost of implementation (exploratory).
Next Steps/Implementation: Our implementation analysis, which includes cost-effectiveness analysis and
qualitative interviews with Veterans and key VA stakeholders, will inform implementation of the program in VA.
We have support from the following three operational partners to implement key learnings into existing VA
programs: VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention including MOVE!, VA Office of
Connected Care, and the VA Chief Improvement and Analytics Officer."
10912445,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a fatal, progressive, incurable neurodegenerative tauopathy. Falls
resulting from gait and balance impairments are a cardinal feature of the disease and occur in all PSP
syndromes. Currently, detection of these abnormalities relies on largely subjective clinical examination and
scales. There are no standardized ways to quantify specific features of gait and balance impairments in PSP.
Diagnostic, and prognostic tests focusing on patient relevant outcomes such as gait related disability are
needed. Motion analysis technology can be used for objective qualification of gait and balance variables. This
offers an opportunity to develop patient-centric diagnostic tools that can measure features of gait impairment
and its impact on risk for falls. Laboratory-based video motion capture utilizes multiple high frequency cameras
in a well calibrated controlled environment to generate a three-dimensional model of human locomotion and
balance. This is considered the most accurate and reliable method of motion analysis. Our project will utilize
laboratory-based motion capture to identify gait metrics that best characterize PSP Richardson syndrome,
PSP-cortical and PSP-subcortical syndromes and distinguish PSP from normal controls. However, accredited
motion analysis labs are not readily accessible, and require an elaborate usually expensive set-up. Body-worn
motion-sensing devices offer a feasible alternative. They are cost-effective, portable, easy to use in ambulatory
settings. However, it is essential to establish reliability and accuracy of these devices in specific patient
populations and assess clinical significance of the data captured. Therefore, in this project we will employ a
body-worn motion sensing device or inertial monitoring unit (IMU) to detect gait and balance metrics that best
characterize PSP. The data from the IMU will then be compared to the motion analysis lab to establish its
accuracy. Gait metrics have the potential to serve as patient-centric outcome measures in PSP. In this project
we will also use these variables to analyze neurobiological mechanisms underlying gait and balance
impairment in PSP. We will correlate the identified gait and balance metrics with volumetric magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography to determine patterns of disruption of cortical
and subcortical motor control systems in PSP. The effect of sex as a biologically significant variable will be
assessed. Age will be a covariate to identify gait abnormalities that are specifically related to disease state and
not secondary to normal aging. The outcomes of this research project will contribute to development of patient
centric outcome measures, assessment of clinical heterogeneity and understanding of mechanisms of gait
impairment in PSP syndromes. Future directions will include longitudinal assessment and comparative
analyses across related neurodegenerative diseases to advance diagnosis and development of patient centric
outcome measures for clinical trials."
10910656,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Malaria, a mosquito-borne parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), remains a significant global
health threat, with ~200 million cases and ~600,000 deaths annually, mainly in children under 5 years of age.
Resistance to the first line antimalarial, artemisinin (ART), has spread across Asia and has now arisen in Africa,
imperiling malaria treatment and control. Despite the pressing need for novel therapeutic targets, discovery of
new fundamental parasite biology lags behind most other pathogens and higher eukaryotes. ART resistance is
primarily mediated by mutations in the K13 protein. While reduced hemoglobin endocytosis plays a central role
in this resistance response, cellular quiescence is also a key component of survival. The drivers of entry into and
exit from drug-induced quiescence remain undiscovered. Quiescence is critical to multiple aspects of parasite
biology, including to the starvation response and in the liver and mosquito stages. In ART-induced quiescence
only a small yet reproducible parasite population survives drug pulse and reinitiates growth, suggesting a role
for epigenetic and epitranscriptomic regulatory mechanisms. We recently uncovered one such mechanism, via
tRNA modification reprogramming, that drug-resistant parasites use to rapidly alter their proteome in a codon-
bias manner as a ‘just-in-time’ translational stress response. We hypothesize that, similar to quiescent tumor
cells and bacterial persister cells, Pf can also use noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) to alter its transcription and
translation in response to stress. Uncovering these yet unidentified mechanisms will fundamentally alter how we
understand transcriptional and translational control in malaria parasites. By harnessing techniques from tumor
biology and bacterial persister systems, we propose to identify and functionally characterize the roles of ncRNAs
in parasite quiescence. We will use transcriptomics to identify differentially changing long ncRNAs and tRNA-
derived fragments in ART-resistant and ART-sensitive parasites after exposure to ART or to isoleucine
starvation. Candidate ncRNAs will be validated using complementary approaches, including CRISPR/Cas9
conditional knockdowns and in vitro parasite drug susceptibility assays. Molecular mechanisms will be elucidated
using biotinylated candidate ncRNAs as bait to identify interacting RNA binding proteins by mass spectrometry
(MS). We will also test the hypothesis that modifications on the amino-acyl tRNA can regulate ART-mediated
quiescence at the translational level by using a combination of specialized MS and genetic knockdown
approaches. Finally, we will create a novel quiescent reporter parasite line, allowing for live cell sorting of
quiescent parasites. This will provide the first opportunity to examine transcriptomic changes at the single cell
level as parasites enter and exit quiescence. We anticipate that our findings will shift the paradigm of how we
understand gene regulation in drug-resistant, blood stage Pf and that the framework and tools generated herein
can be expanded to other quiescent stages of the parasite lifecycle. Our results will also identify parasite
vulnerabilities that can be leveraged into new strategies to treat ART-resistant malaria."
10912448,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lung cancer causes about 25% of all cancer deaths worldwide. Early detection and effective treatment are
critical in reducing the mortality. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) is the recommended screening test for
lung cancer, however, its high false-positive rate leads to unnecessary biopsy and repeated radiation
exposure. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized treatment for lung cancer, however, they
are only effective for a minority of patients. Predicting and monitoring responses to ICIs by tissue biopsy and
imaging are limited by invasive procedure, the lack of effective tumor biomarkers, pseudo progression, and
delayed response. Therefore, non-invasive, accurate and affordable methods are urgently needed to detect
lung cancer early and to effectively predict and monitor response to ICIs, aiding in improving patient outcomes.
 Liquid biopsy detects tumor-derived biomarkers in body fluids such as blood, complements imaging and risk
factor data, allows sequential monitoring of cancer development, and thus represents a new and non-invasive
strategy to address these unmet needs. Exosomes are nano-sized extracellular vesicles secreted by cells.
They are actively involved in every step of cancer development and have emerged as promising cancer
biomarkers. We hypothesize that tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) are highly sensitive and specific for lung
cancer early detection and treatment response prediction and monitoring, and the combination of TEX markers
provides superior diagnostic and predictive performances than single markers alone.
 A major challenge in developing exosomes-based cancer biomarkers is the separation of TEXs from
exosomes released by normal cells, the latter of which can render the test less sensitive or incapable of
detecting TEX biomarkers. To overcome this challenge, we have developed an exosome protein RNA one stop
(Exo-PROS) biosensor. The Exo-PROS assay first selectively captures TEXs from non-TEXs using cancer-
overexpressed markers, and then, for the first time, provides one-stop and in-situ quantitation of three types of
TEX biomarkers including proteins, microRNAs and carbohydrate antigens. In our pilot study, we demonstrated
that combined TEX biomarkers (EGFR, miR-21, LG3BP, miR-210, TF-Ag-α) distinguished lung cancer from
normal controls with sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 1.00. We also showed that TEX PD-L1, miR-21 and
TF-Ag-α successfully predicted the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer patients. In this project, we
will (1) further develop the Exo-PROS assay and characterize its analytical performances including sensitivity,
specificity, linear range and repeatability; (2) determine the diagnostic values of Exo-PROS assay in lung
cancer early detection and demonstrate that Exo-PROS assay complements low dose CT and improves the
diagnostic accuracy; (3) evaluate Exo-PROS assay in predicting and monitoring response to anti-PD-1
therapy, and demonstrate that Exo-PROS assay is an effective test to complement tissue biopsy and imaging
modalities in clinical decision making and patient care."
10911683,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this Phase IIB SBIR project is to optimize, validate and obtain regulatory approval to
support commercialization for PointCheckTM, the first non-invasive medical device that enables
continuous monitoring of cancer chemotherapy patients from home, detecting severe neutropenia and
enabling early intervention to prevent serious infections. Every year in the US, 850,000 cancer patients
are treated with chemotherapy. A main side effect of treatment is neutropenia, a life-threatening condition
caused by low levels of neutrophils that leads to hospitalization, increased risk of mortality and total associated
costs of $6.4B annually. PointCheck uses noninvasive optical imaging of the microcirculation in nailfold
capillaries to detect severe neutropenia without the need for a blood sample. It is intended for use by cancer
patients undergoing chemotherapy, in order to identify patients with neutropenia and enable early intervention
that could prevent 50% of serious infections, hospital readmission costs and morbidity. Because it is self-
administered and does not require blood sampling or reagents, it ultimately may be used by patients at home
to frequently monitor blood counts between chemotherapy sessions.
In Phase I of this project, Leuko successfully validated a manually operated PointCheck prototype on a proof-
of-concept study with 44 chemotherapy patients. In Phase II, we completed the design of a beta PointCheck
unit that fully automates data acquisition in the hands of naïve users, executed a usability and feasibility study
with 154 and 193 subjects, respectively, and validated that the usability (SUS=86.1) and diagnostic accuracy
(Sensitivity/Specificity=100/84%) of the final device design exceed the requirements for regulatory approval
that FDA communicated to us through a pre-submission meeting.
The objective in this Phase IIB is to complete the remaining steps to bring PointCheck to market. In Aim 1, we
will complete pilot production of 20 PointCheck units to support clinical trials and FDA approval. In Aim 2, we
will execute our pivotal study (N=210 patients) following FDA pre-submission requirements. In Aim 3, we will
submit a Class II De Novo application to the FDA. In Aim 4, we will conduct an initial healthcare outcomes
study (N=50 patients) to support reimbursement and provide the basis for commercial adoption.
Successful completion of this Phase IIB project will fulfill the requirements for a minimum viable product and
enable initial commercialization of this first-in-kind technology that will drastically improve the management of
febrile neutropenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy."

Inherited mutations in genes governing telomere maintenance cause Telomere biology disorders (TBD), a group
of diseases with a progressive course and poor prognosis characterized by pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis,
and bone marrow failure (BMF). Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing telomere preservation and
identifying TBD associated genes are established gaps. We recently published novel germline heterozygous
missense variants in RPA1 in four unrelated probands presenting with TBD. We also demonstrated that RPA1
mutants have elevated affinity to random and telomere single strand DNA, which causes a unique gain-of-
function (GoF) effect, defective hematopoiesis due to short telomeres in RPA1 mutant iPSC cells and extensive
somatic rescue mosaicism. The molecular mechanism through which RPA1 GoF mutations cause telomere
shortening, and TBD is unknown. I hypothesize that RPA1 mutations cause TBD by outcompeting essential
telomere maintenance proteins for binding to ssDNA, thereby limiting stem cell replicative potential. The
proposed studies will investigate these questions through two specific aims: 1) determine the molecular
mechanism by which GoF RPA1E240K causes telomere dysfunction and 2) determine the effect of RPA1E240K on
telomere maintenance and hematopoiesis in vivo.

10913352,"NINDS Application Abstract
Pluripotent stem cells were originally isolated from embryos but their utility as tools for research and therapeutic
development was severely restricted due to ethical considerations as well as the inability to derive stem cells
from subjects with known disorders. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) generated from adult somatic
cells were first described in 2007. Since then, hiPSCs have been established from subjects with specific
disorders (many with known genotypes) and then differentiated to relevant cell types such as neurons for central
nervous system disorders. Using these hiPSC we can create “disease models in a dish” that can model cell
development and disease progression and be used for drug screening and for toxicology testing. However,
human genetic diversity has hampered the usefulness of individual hiPSC for disease modeling. Controls often
consist of age and sex-matched non-affected family members or other subjects. The CRISPR (clustered
regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas system can now generate isogenic hiPSC that will serve
as better controls and help eliminate effects that are due to genetic background, thus providing a better
understanding of mechanisms of human disease and development.
 The NINDS Human Cell and Data Repository (NHCDR) was established to collect, derive and distribute
human cells such as skin fibroblasts and blood cells and convert these to iPSCs for research on
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Dystonia and Frontotemporal Degeneration. Since 1998, RUCDR Infinite
Biologics® (RUCDR) has provided the NIH, private foundations and the global scientific community with the
highest quality biomaterials, technical consultation, and logistical support for human genetics research. In 2011,
RUCDR began providing its stem cell services to the NIH, including source cell and iPSC banking; iPSC
generation; iPSC gene editing; and source cell and iPSC distribution. In 2015, RUCDR successfully competed
for the NHCDR and in the past 5 years the catalog has grown to contain 268 FCL lines from 256 subjects and
259 iPSC lines from 132 subjects, including the addition of 7 isogenic pairs of iPSC. During this time RUCDR
shipped 458 orders for 1538 cell lines to investigators around the world. The continuing mission of the NHCDR
is to work with NINDS investigators and staff on all aspects of study management to collect, process and
distribute the highest quality cell lines from human subjects. This effort includes the culturing of fibroblasts from
skin biopsies, the isolation of lymphocytes from blood, and the derivation of iPSC lines from both cell types.
RUCDR will continue to provide a comprehensive range of quality testing of iPSCs to ensure they conform to
the highest standards. If requested, we will also provide additional services to the global community, including
the generation of neural stem cells (NSCs) and different types of neurons. RUCDR will continue to exhibit
scientific flexibility to grow and adapt to leading best practices in the stem cell field."
10914326,"Abstract (Research Capacity Core - RCC)
North Carolina Central University’s (NCCU) RCMI Center for Health Disparities Research (RCHDR) was created
in September 2017 and includes a Research Infrastructure Core (RIC) aimed at building and enhancing
biomedical research infrastructure at NCCU. In last 4 years, RIC has responded to the needs of researchers and
suggestions by our advisory committees to develop basic, behavioral and population health infrastructure. In its
first cycle, RIC provided support for 3 full projects, 6 Investigator Development Core (IDC) funded pilot projects,
24 additional (non-RCHDR) seed grants and over 20 NIH-funded projects. The RIC also added new capabilities
in analytical, imaging, metabolic analysis, and rodent behavior studies, as well as creating multiple health
disparities-focused programs in data equity, health communications, and environmental equity. To maintain and
expand our health disparity research activities at NCCU, RCHDR proposes to continue building our research
eco-system through the redesigned Research Capacity Core (RCC). RCC will further enhance our resources in
both basic biomedical and behavioral sciences; and lay the groundwork for NCCU researchers to conduct
population and health services research pilot studies. RCC will also integrate strategic collaborations with NIH-
funded Centers at area institutions and other RCMI centers (through the RCMI coordinating center) to increase
our research capacity in biomedical, behavioral, and health-related research. To achieve these goals, we
propose three specific aims: SA1: Redesign the RCC to support basic biomedical, behavioral and health services
research by developing innovative sub-cores that address research needs. These sub-cores will support a broad
range of projects in multiple departments across NCCU and leverage partnerships with neighboring institutions.
SA2: Support two research projects in the current proposal and future pilot projects focused on interdisciplinary
basic biomedical, behavioral and population/health services research. The RCC will also support Community
Engagement Core (CEC) activities and other research projects throughout NCCU, complement existing
resources and expand the presence and impact of RCHDR. SA3: Ensure and sustain the effectiveness of the
RCC sub-cores through a structured daily management plan that includes integration of units, usage (cost
recovery), governance and communication with other research partners (e.g., universities, research
organizations and industry)."
10914327,"Abstract – Community Engagement Core
Heath Disparities (HD) disproportionately affects racially and ethnically diverse communities and are the result
of a complex set of factors that have historical, social, political, and environmental roots. Addressing HD requires
meaningful partnerships across stakeholders that operate from community-based and community engagement
principles. North Carolina Central University’s (NCCU) RCMI Center for Health Disparities Research (RCHDR)
includes a Community Engagement Core (CEC) with a goal of strengthening community engagement and
building strong partnerships with community stakeholders in underserved, minority communities of North
Carolina. During initial funding we were able to establish the CEC as a community-centered and trusted source
with several key focus areas. In addition to our community facing efforts and activities, part of the community
capacity building focused on researchers where we convened a group committed to thoughtful and ethical
research, as seen in our ‘Research with Care’ brand, of ‘TEAM NCCU’. In this competitive renewal, through
innovative and culturally appropriate community engagement efforts, the NCCU-CEC will continue to build and
support community capacity, establish relationships with community-based organizations, and public health
departments, be responsive to health needs, promote culturally competent research, increase research
participation, and disseminate findings from RCHDR research projects. Objectives of the CEC include 1)
Fostering sustainable community partnerships by creating a community-based network (CBN), 2) Leveraging
expertise to support and build capacity for and in our underserved communities, and 3) Establishing a bi-
directional Community Research and Translation Hub to disseminate health information and research findings
to diverse community stakeholders."

We propose to continue a highly successful Training Program in the Molecular Biology of
Neurodegeneration and Alzheimer’s disease - a program devoted to the training of pre- and
postdoctoral students for careers as independent research scientists in universities and health-related
research laboratories. The trainers are all Harvard faculty members with active research programs
related to neurodegeneration, with an emphasis on Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative
disorders related to aging. They are drawn from the Harvard Medical School and five affiliated
research hospitals: Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital,
Children’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Massachusetts General Hospital. Bringing a
wide range of experience and experimental approaches to the problems of age-related
neurodegeneration, the Program faculty includes molecular biologists, geneticists, cell biologists,
neuropathologists, and biochemists.
 The predoctoral students are recruited into and drawn from the graduate students in the
degree-granting Neuroscience Program of the Harvard Medical School. The postdoctoral students
are chosen from among applicants nominated by individual faculty members of the Program.
Selection of trainees occurs through a competitive process mediated by a Training Grant Advisory
Committee. A total of six predoctoral trainees and eight postdoctoral trainees are proposed for a
primary training faculty of 25 individuals experienced in basic and applied studies of age-related
neurodegeneration. The main criteria for successful candidates is dedication and interest in aging
and neurodegeneration research and the highest level of academic achievement in their previous
training. Students are required to participate in special neurodegeneration courses, seminars, and
symposia. Close monitoring of student progress and career advising provide an effective structure for
the entire training process. The purpose of the Program is to create a framework within which the
best training of future researchers devoted to problems in aging and neurodegeneration can take
place, and the already extensive collaborative interactions among the Program faculty can be
propagated at all levels, from student to Professor."

The research proposed by the UT Lung Cancer SPORE encompasses a broad range of activities, including
studies in clinically annotated patient tumor samples, tumor cell lines, xenografts, and mouse models, as well as
human clinical trials. These studies generate multiple types of data, including clinical, histologic, genome-wide
molecular (mutation, expression), proteomic, biochemical, immunohistochemical, drug and immune response
phenotype, metabolomic, and tumor environmental. The Data Sciences Core provides comprehensive expertise
to ensure the statistical integrity, data integrity, data sharing capability, and data analysis accuracy of the studies
performed by the SPORE. The Core has a Director at each institution (Y. Xie, UTSW, and J. Wang, MDACC)
and the flexibility to match personnel to the evolving needs of existing SPORE Projects, and Developmental
Research and Career Enhancement Program (DRP, CEP) Projects. To ensure appropriate consideration of
biostatistics and data management concerns throughout all SPORE work, members of this Core participate in
monthly all-SPORE Project and Core meetings, and in the specific Data Sciences SPORE video/WebEx
conferences linking researchers at UTSW and MDACC. The Data Sciences Core will perform the following: (a)
develop and maintain systems for data storage, retrieval, analysis, and sharing; (b) provide an interface for all
SPORE investigators to exchange data and information easily and freely; (c) provide analyses to allow
investigators outside the UT Lung SPORE to have appropriate access to SPORE datasets, and to be able easily
to independently reproduce and validate biostatistical and computational analyses. The Core services include
innovative, unique, and occasionally customized approaches to solving the data analysis and interpretation
challenges of the modern data-centric research laboratory. The Core Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Provide valid
statistical designs for SPORE laboratory research, clinical trials and translational experiments. Aim 2: Oversee
and conduct innovative statistical modeling, simulations, data analyses and data integration needed by the
Projects, DRP and CEP, and Pathology Core to achieve their specific aims. Aim 3: Ensure that all complex
molecular, biologic, and clinical datasets are protected for confidentiality, analyzed, shared among SPORE
investigators and collaborators, and appropriately deposited into publically accessible databases as required,
using valid and innovative bioinformatics methods. Aim 4: Develop and maintain a secure, web-accessible site
for SPORE research data integration and storage linked to an extensive tissue repository of clinically and
molecularly annotated archived patient samples, tumor grafts, tumor and normal cell lines, and relevant mouse
models of lung cancer; we will also (a) develop and maintain centralized deposits from the literature of lung
cancer-relevant datasets in a web site (“Lung Cancer Explorer”) to support SPORE investigators and the broader
research community; and (b) provide data-related analyses and documents for publication (such as “Sweave”)
that allow the research community to independently reproduce and validate our analyses."
10911205,"Project 1 Project Summary/Abstract
Human lung tumors are metabolically distinct from adjacent lung tissue. It is unknown whether these
reprogrammed activities predict clinical outcomes or represent meaningful therapeutic liabilities. The major
bottleneck in understanding the clinical relevance of cancer metabolism has been a lack of data about human
tumor metabolism in vivo. For the first time, we have overcome this limitation and used intra-operative infusions
with 13C-glucose to define metabolic phenotypes in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We reported
that one NSCLC subset displays prominent import of lactate, while another subset produces lactate from
glucose. Our observation that lactate uptake via monocarboxylate transport protein-1 (MCT1) correlates with
rapid disease progression in lung adenocarcinoma is the first and to date only metabolic flux phenotype
demonstrated to predict clinical outcomes in any human cancer. In this Project, we will expand the scope of
metabolic analysis in human NSCLC, performing 13C infusions in more than 100 patients, assessing hundreds
of metabolites in each tumor, and following clinical histories to identify new activities correlating with outcomes.
In Specific Aim 1, tumors infused with 13C will be analyzed by imaging, quantitative histopathology, RNA
sequencing and whole exome sequencing to understand relationships between these features and cancer
metabolism. We will focus on identifying metabolic features that correlate with reduced progression-free survival,
under the rationale that such activities are attractive therapeutic targets to test in preclinical models. We will
establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from these tumors to test the importance of predictive metabolic
activities for tumor growth and metastasis. While our open-ended metabolomics approach is designed to uncover
novel therapeutic targets, based on our earlier work, we will specifically test whether inhibiting MCT1 reduces
tumor growth and metastasis in mice. In Specific Aim 2 we will follow up on our observation that lung squamous
cell carcinomas require lactate export for maximal growth. We will test whether genetic or pharmacological
inhibition of novel molecular components of MCT4-mediated lactate export suppresses tumor growth in mouse
models and PDXs. Specific Aim 3 will examine metabolic crosstalk among cancer cells and several important
immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment in mice and humans. We will test the hypothesis that
lactate metabolism impacts these metabolic exchanges and that blocking lactate transport enhances the efficacy
of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Overall, these efforts will produce the most detailed and clinically-
relevant view of NSCLC metabolism to date. The ability to combine our ongoing study assessing metabolic flux
in human NSCLC with large legacy clinical datasets ideally positions us to understand the relationship between
tumor metabolism and cancer progression, and to advance high-priority therapeutic targets into clinical trials.
The immediate Human Endpoint of this project is the direct, detailed examination of tumor metabolism and
tumor microenvironment patients with lung cancer following 13C-glucose infusions, while later Human Endpoints
will involve therapeutic interventions targeting MCT1 and MCT4."
10911206,"Project 2 Summary/Abstract
Immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade (PCB) given alone or with chemotherapy now represents
the standard first-line treatment for NSCLC patients with wild-type (wt) EGFR and ALK. This is a major advance,
but the majority of NSCLC patients do not have an objective response to PCB. The molecular determinants of
PCB resistance are incompletely understood, although low tumor mutation burden and PD-L1 levels predict
some cases. Recently, we reported that LKB1 deficient (LD) tumors resulting from mutations or deletions in the
STK11/LKB1 gene are associated with an inert or “cold” immune phenotype and represent the largest
genomically-define subgroup with primary resistance to PCB, accounting for more than 30% of PCB resistance
in lung adenocarcinoma. The LKB1 protein is a master regulator of metabolism, energetic balance, and
nucleotide stores. Recent publications from our group and others indicate that LD tumors have a distinct
metabolic phenotype that includes enhanced lactate production, vulnerability to targeting intracellular nucleotide
pathways, and increased replicative stress (RS). These features may contribute to the “cold” immune phenotype.
The primary goals of Project 2 (P2) are to investigate new therapeutic approaches for targeting LD NSCLC and
enhancing antitumor immunity, with a focus on targeting the lactate pathway and RS. This focus integrates the
immunotherapy focus of Project 2 with studies in the other SPORE Projects and provides multiple Human
Endpoints for the SPORE Projects. We hypothesize that: 1) Enhanced lactate production or secretion
contributes to the “cold” immune phenotype in LD NSCLC; 2) LD NSCLC will be preferentially vulnerable to
targeting RS; and 3) targeting RS and/or lactate pathways may enhance antitumor immunity and response to
PCB. To test these hypotheses, in SA1 we will comprehensively characterize the immune phenotypes of LD
NSCLC using two sets of resected tumors: the MD Anderson ICON cohort and a validation cohort from UTSW
which have undergone metabolic labeling in P1. We will also examine immune cells in greater detail using single
cell RNA sequencing. In SA2 we will test whether targeting the lactate pathway using inhibitors of MCT4 and
LDHA can reverse LD-associated immunosuppression and enhance PCB efficacy. In SA3, we will target RS
using inhibitors of ATM, ATR, and the nucleoside analog 6-thio-dG in collaboration with P4, alone or in
combination with PCB. Significance: LD NSCLC tumors have a “cold” immune phenotype and frequent primary
resistance to PCB or PCB/chemotherapy. This patient population is larger than EGFR-mutant NSCLC and
comparably sized to metastatic pancreatic cancer. P2 aims to leverage our unique set of clinical and preclinical
resources to develop more effective therapeutic approaches for LD NSCLC patients, which can then translated
by our group and others into the clinic. P2 also provides the opportunity to spearhead a new paradigm of
genomically-guided, tailored immunotherapy for PCB-resistant tumors."
10911207,"Project 3 Project Summary/Abstract
Substantial therapeutic advances have been made in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based
on the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Unfortunately, the majority of
patients do not benefit from this single-agent approach, either due to primary or acquired resistance
mechanisms. There is a knowledge gap about the interplay between the tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the
dynamic changes in the extracellular matrix and tumor microenvironment that may drive an immunosuppressive
microenvironment, which translates into a major unmet therapeutic need. The members of our multidisciplinary
team (Gibbons, Kurie, Cascone, Yamauchi, Dalby, Wistuba, and Wang) have a track record of productivity in
studying tumor matrix dynamics and immune factors in the microenvironment during lung cancer progression
and in response to immune therapy. The investigators bring expertise in mouse modeling of human lung cancer,
clinical oncology, immunotherapy, molecular pathology of lung cancer, drug development and
bioinformatics/biostatistics. We have developed preliminary data from analysis of human lung cancer specimens
and preclinical genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of NSCLC that the deposition and crosslinking
of the collagen matrix suppresses intratumoral surveillance by immune cells. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that extracellular matrix deposition and collagen crosslinking in the tumor microenvironment
suppress tumor-infiltrating immune cells, facilitating tumor invasion and metastasis. Through parallel study of
pre-clinical models and assessment of patient samples, we will address this hypothesis and explore clinical
translational opportunities by: 1. evaluating the role of collagen crosslinking enzymes and a fibrotic extracellular
matrix on the immune cell profile of murine and human lung tumors; 2. determining how treatment with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI, e.g. anti-PD-(L)1 and/or anti-CTLA-4) alters extracellular matrix composition and
crosslinking in murine and patient tumors; and 3. testing the efficacy of agents that block fibrotic collagen
crosslinking or collagen-mediated T cell suppression, with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors to reverse
the suppression of a productive intratumoral immune response in preclinical models. The Human Endpoint is
demonstrated in our analysis of key ECM features in: A. SPORE tumor samples; B. 150 paired surgical
tumor/normal samples and >500 blood samples from previously untreated patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC
from the MDACC ImmunogenomiC prOfiling of NSCLC (ICON) study; C. 44 paired tumor/normal samples from
patients treated on the MDACC NEOSTAR study of neoadjuvant ICI for resectable stage I-IIIA NSCLC; and D.

10933343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pediatric asthma, the most common chronic condition of childhood, has known disparities, particularly among
racial and ethnic minority children who experience higher asthma morbidity. Asthma is also more prevalent
among children in rural, impoverished areas, including rural Arkansas (AR), where rural and underresourced
children face high rates of asthma prevalence, morbidity, and increased healthcare utilization. For example,
asthma prevalence in the rural AR Delta region is 19%, compared to the state average of 10%. Additionally,
preliminary state-wide data found that Black children with asthma in AR are more likely to have asthma-related
ED visits (8.2%, p<0.001) than other race and ethnicity groups. Arkansan children living in low opportunity areas,
as designated by the Child Opportunity Index, a measure of neighborhood inequity, were also more likely to have
worse asthma outcomes. Preliminary state-wide data also suggest that current asthma risk tools are inadequate
for identifying Arkansan children at high risk for poor asthma outcomes. Research is needed to identify and
understand factors influencing disparate pediatric asthma outcomes among rural, underresourced, and racial
and ethnic minority pediatric populations. By understanding these specific factors, this proposal seeks to inform
targeted interventions that address the unique needs of these populations in AR and other similar rural,
underresourced populations. This K23 proposal for a 4-year mentored research career development award
seeks to improve scientific knowledge of multilevel (patient, provider, and community-level) factors influencing
pediatric asthma outcomes through systematically investigating multifactorial determinants of asthma in AR.
Additionally, evaluating variation in asthma outcomes and care at multiple levels will aid in identifying children at
risk for poor asthma outcomes and will be the foundation of clinically relevant patient-centered intervention
strategies for children with asthma. The proposal aims to (Aim 1) identify population-specific pediatric asthma
risk factors, barriers, intervention preferences, and opportunities for intervention through the engagement of
children with asthma and their caregivers, and (Aim 2) examine patient, provider, and community-level factors
impacting disparity and inequity in optimal delivery and receipt of asthma care using the Arkansas All-Payer
Claims Database. An exploratory sequential mixed methods approach will be used to achieve these aims. The
long-term goal of this study is to improve asthma outcomes and promote health equity for underresourced
populations by applying innovative research tools and strategies to enhance individual and population-level care
in pediatric asthma. An outstanding mentorship team with cross-disciplinary expertise in (1) qualitative and mixed
methods, (2) population health science, and (3) asthma health disparities research, along with a clear training
plan to address the need for additional training in qualitative and mixed methods research approaches, will
ensure success in completing the proposed K23 research, and development of the PI into an independent,
extramurally-funded researcher."
10934717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social isolation, defined as an objective state of limited to no social contact, impacts millions of older adults, with
prevalence estimates varying from 10-25% across studies and measures. The pandemic exacerbated rates of
social isolation, increasing concerns about the link between social isolation and risk of Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRDs) and drawing attention to the need for interventions. Interventions target social
isolation by enhancing social connections (e.g. matched peers, telephone warm lines, and community groups)
or preventing the loss of social ties. However, major gaps separate observational research linking social isolation
to ADRDs from intervention design. Observational research has typically focused on broad, heterogeneous
social isolation or engagement measures that do not clearly correspond to typical interventions. Further,
observational research has not ruled out the potential influences of reverse causation, given the likely impact of
ADRDs on social disengagement. Moreover, questions about the heterogeneous impacts of social isolation on
ADRDs across population groups (e.g. gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and time (pre- and within-
pandemic) have received little attention. As a result, we still have a limited understanding of how interventions
addressing social isolation might impact ADRDs-related inequities. Our primary objective is therefore to identify
the effects of social isolation and hypothetical interventions which reduce social isolation on ADRD risk by
carefully triangulating evidence across multiple data sources using a range of methods meant to address core
methodological challenges in this research. We will leverage a framework to emulate “target” intervention trials
in observational cohorts, which can approximate the impact of hypothetical social isolation interventions on
ADRD risk, while addressing bias in observational studies such as reverse causation and time-dependent
confounding. Our secondary objectives are to identify the extent to which social isolation contributes to well-
characterized ADRDs inequities. We hypothesize that social isolation will be associated with ADRDs risk, but
that estimates will vary from previously published results, and have a greater impact for structurally marginalized
groups, after addressing key sources of bias and/or directly emulating “target” intervention trials. To test this
hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1) Estimate the impact of a) social isolation and b) hypothetical
social isolation interventions on ADRDs, triangulating across diverse data sources and study designs; Aim 2)
Evaluate population-level heterogeneity in the association between social isolation and ADRDs; and Aim 3)
Quantify reductions in ADRDs achievable through interventions on social isolation for population subgroups.
Substantial preliminary data is provided in this resubmission demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. This
proposal will have a significant impact in yielding the most rigorous estimates to-date of the potential impacts of
real-world interventions to reduce social isolation on ADRDs risk and ADRDs inequities using multiple high-
quality population-based data sources, which can guide ongoing intervention development."

Age is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) and hematological malignancies. The purpose
of this supplement is to understand the prevalence and impact of AD-neuropathology and
inflammation on cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD) in older adults undergoing hematopoietic
cell transplantation (HCT). We will examine the interaction between CRCD and AD, in the context
of a physical activity intervention study. The parent award (NIA K23; PI Koll), which is currently in
the RCT phase, aims to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 6-month, moderate-
intensity physical activity intervention on cognitive function in older adults undergoing HCT. The
K23 study includes measures of cognitive domains vulnerable to CRCD, physical function and
physical activity. This supplement will add measures of brain volumes (MRI), inflammation, and
AD biomarkers in both the immediate intervention and the waitlist control group. Data collection
will occur during Year 4-5 of the K23 study. We will test the association between pre-HCT
(baseline) AD neuropathology on cognitive function and brain volumes longitudinally (Aim 1). We
will examine the effect of physical activity on the change in cognitive function and brain volume
longitudinally (Aim 2). We will explore the association between biomarkers of inflammation,
cognitive function and brain volume at baseline and 12 months post-HCT (Aim 3). The results of
this research will expand our knowledge on the shared mechanisms and interactions between AD
and CRCD."
10935764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lysosomes are essential membrane-bound organelles that play a vital role in cellular degradation and signaling.
Damage to lysosomes can be triggered by numerous physiological and pathological conditions, significantly
threatening cellular function and survival. Consequently, lysosomal damage is associated with an array of human
diseases including cancer, infectious and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as normal aging. Therefore,
studying cellular responses to lysosomal damage holds substantial clinical importance. My postdoctoral research
provided novel evidence about the molecular aspects of these responses. Additionally, a recent first-author
publication, before becoming a Tenure-track Assistant Professor (1/2023), provided the first evidence that
lysosomal damage induces the formation of stress granules (SGs). SGs are stress-induced membrane-less
organelles believed to protect cells during stress by regulating protein synthesis and prioritizing cellular functions.
Although dysfunctional SGs are significantly linked to pathogenic processes of various human diseases, there
is a significant knowledge gap regarding the regulation and precise function of SG formation during stress,
especially in the context of lysosomal damage. Importantly, recognizing lysosomal damage as a critical internal
physiological trigger for SGs highlights the need to better understand the nature of SG formation in disease
contexts. Additionally, this novel connection between damaged lysosomes and SGs emphasizes the interplay
between membrane-bound and membrane-less organelles, a largely unexplored field of research. Recent
preliminary data from my laboratory illustrates that SG formation safeguards lysosomal quality, thereby
promoting cell survival. Notably, we also recently published the first evidence that SG-localized proteins can
associate with damaged lysosomes, serving additional (largely unknown) functions beyond SG formation.
Building on the established platform of seminal work on lysosomal damage, the proposed investigations will
focus on two primary goals: (1) Establishing the precise function of SG formation in controlling lysosomal quality,
and (2) Determining how lysosomal damage induces SG formation. These goals will be achieved by investigating
the function of SGs as organelles and the independent novel activities of SG proteins in controlling lysosomal
quality, and defining the molecular mechanisms that transmit signals from lysosomal damage to initiate SG
formation, respectively. To complete the two primary goals, the multidisciplinary and diverse team will employ
state-of-the-art approaches including high-content microscopy, lysosome immunoprecipitation, proteomic
analysis and RNAi screening. Collectively, the investigations will reveal novel insight into how cells respond to
lysosomal damage, the precise nature of SG formation, and inter-organelle interactions under stress conditions.
These findings have the potential to facilitate innovative therapies directed at addressing diseases associated
with lysosomes and SGs. Success in the proposed application will foster a unique research direction for important
breakthroughs in my early independent research career, aligning with the objectives of the MIRA program."

Oxidative stress contributes to the development and progression of ocular diseases including cataracts,
glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy. One carbon metabolism influences the
response to oxidative stress via antioxidant biosynthesis; however, this pathway is also perturbed upon oxidative
stress in the Drosophila eye. One explanation for the observed dysregulation of one carbon metabolism under
oxidative stress is because of oxidative modifications on the key enzyme, Adenosylhomocysteinase (Ahcy). Ahcy
is a highly conserved enzyme and is solely responsible for the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) into
adenosine and homocysteine in all higher eukaryotes. Upon inducing oxidative stress in Drosophila cells and
eyes, Ahcy becomes oxidized at cysteine residue 195 (C195) correlating with increased SAH. This is important
because increases in SAH can inhibit methylation reactions and alter the epigenome; however, the mechanism
by which oxidative stress perturbs one carbon metabolism is unknown. Based on these data, I hypothesize that
redox modifications at C195 inhibit Ahcy activity under oxidative stress leading to increased SAH and a
decreased methylation capacity resulting in changes in gene expression. In the proposed studies, I will employ
in vitro assays, biochemical, genome-wide sequencing, and genetic manipulation studies to elucidate if Ahcy is
redox regulated and if it serves as a neuroprotective mechanism against retinal degeneration. In aim I, I will
determine if C195 is the only (or major) oxidized cysteine, determine the type of oxidative modification,
characterize the impact of C195 oxidation on enzymatic activity of Ahcy using a novel DESI-MS approach, and
test if C195 mutations regulate Ahcy enzymatic function in vivo. In aim II, I will identify genes regulated by Ahcy,
test if the genetic downregulation of Ahcy alleviates blue light induced retinal damage, and identify the genomic
loci directly bound by Ahcy. Along with the experiments planned in these aims, I will obtain expertise in
recombinant protein purification, enzymatic assay development and characterization, and proficiency in large-
scale dataset bioinformatic analyses. These skillsets will be an asset for my future career goal of entering the
pharmaceutical industry. Overall, this proposal will elucidate the regulation mechanism of Ahcy and may lay the
foundation for future studies to develop targeted therapies to delay or prevent the onset ocular disease."
10903090,"Project Summary/Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by exposure to environmental toxins are a constant source of DNA
damage. If not properly repaired, this DNA damage can result in subsequent mutations and genomic instability,
ultimately resulting in disease. The primary pathway used by cells to repair oxidative DNA damage arising from
this environmental exposure is the base excision repair (BER) pathway. One of the key enzymes in BER is DNA
polymerase beta (pol ꞵ), which is responsible for the insertion of a nucleotide at the site of a one-nucleotide gap.
How pol ꞵ carries out this activity has been well studied using linear DNA. However, most eukaryotic DNA is
organized into chromatin, where DNA is extensively bound by nucleosomes. This creates a barrier to efficient
BER due to DNA occlusion by the histone octamer. Therefore, repair in this setting is both more difficult and is
poorly understood at the mechanistic level. Within nucleosomes, x-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1),
a non-enzymatic scaffolding protein, has been shown to increase the rate of DNA repair through BER. XRCC1
forms a strong complex with pol ꞵ, with some evidence showing XRCC1 facilitates pol ꞵ recruitment to DNA
damage in nucleosomes. However, the mechanism by which XRCC1 fulfills this role with pol ꞵ is unclear. With
more than 10,000 oxidative DNA lesions generated per cell per day, and the ubiquitous nature of this damage
in chromatin, understanding how BER repairs these lesions in nucleosomes is critical to our understanding of
DNA damage repair following exposure to environmental toxins. The goal of this study is to establish how
XRCC1 facilitates pol ꞵ DNA damage search, recognition, and repair within chromatin at the structural
and mechanistic level. To test this, I propose the following aims: (1) Determine how pol ꞵ and XRCC1 search
DNA and recognize DNA damage in chromatin and (2) Determine the structural basis of pol ꞵ and XRCC1 DNA
damage recognition in chromatin. To accomplish these aims, I will comprehensively study the mechanisms pol
ꞵ and XRCC1 employ to locate DNA damage and what structural changes are induced by the XRCC1/pol ꞵ
complex binding DNA damage on nucleosomes. Specifically, correlative-optical tweezers and fluorescence
microscopy (CTFM) will determine the mechanisms that pol ꞵ and XRCC1 use to search DNA (Aim 1A) and
recognize DNA damage (Aim 1B). Cryo-EM will be used to determine the structure of XRCC1 and the pol
ꞵ/XRCC1 complex on nucleosomes containing DNA damage (Aim 2A). Finally, a combination of single-turnover
kinetics and gel shift assays will determine the impact XRCC1 has on pol ꞵ single-nucleotide insertion and
binding affinity on the nucleosome (Aim 2B). This innovative project will be completed at the University of Kansas
Medical Center under the supervision of an expert sponsorship team. In addition to technical skills, the training
plan also prioritizes scientific communication, writing, and mentorship. The proposed experiments will provide
me with the foundation for a successful and productive independent research career."
10934938,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
We feel that the Department of Anesthesiology and the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center (CPFRC)
at the University of Michigan (UM) would be ideally positioned to be a part of the HEAL PAIN Cohort Program.
We already have established inter-disciplinary partnerships with investigative teams at UM and beyond who
work in nearly all of the disciplines listed in the FOA including engineering, social sciences, epidemiology,
biostatistics, computer sciences, bioengineering, addiction medicine, public health, and or mental
health/behavioral health. Our core CPFRC faculty share this inter-disciplinary diversity. Amongst our 11 core
faculty we only have one physician; we have three pain psychologists, two neuroscientists, a
psychoneuroimmunologist, a social scientist, an epidemiologist, an environmental health scientist turned
cannabis and psychedelic researcher, and a social worker turned neuroscientist (Baker). However we do not
currently have a post-doctoral training grant specifically designed to support and train the next generation of
inter-disciplinary post-doctoral clinical pain researchers.
Our proposed University of Michigan (UM) HEAL Initiative® Partnership to Advance INterdisciplinary (PAIN)
Training in Clinical Pain Research (the UM HEAL PAIN Cohort T90/R90) will support interdisciplinary
postdoctoral training to promote the next generation of independent clinical pain researchers. We feel that the
proposed UM HEAL PAIN Cohort Program can provide exemplary training in six of ten HEAL content areas,
including: chronic overlapping pain conditions; effective interventions for pain and co-morbidities; non-opioid
pharmacological treatments for pain; nonpharmacological interventions for pain; pain across the lifespan;
prevention of the transition from acute to chronic pain; and bioinformatics. We also feel that our program
mentors can provide clinical pain research training in several fields that have not historically been well
represented in pain research including engineering; social sciences; epidemiology; biostatistics; computer
sciences; addiction medicine; public health; and mental health/behavioral health.
Although we have identified and named five mentors who are established pain researchers and five others in
the under-represented fields, UM has a vast number of established pain researchers and mentors at various
points in their career that are not accustomed to receiving effort to mentor. Those non-named UM faculty will
augment the mentors named in the grant, to enable us to assign each trainee both a junior and senior mentor,
since we feel they often bring different perspectives. We also are using departmental support of the CPFRC
Health Equity Core and its many patient partners with lived experience. We will also assign each trainee a
person with lived experience to be part of their mentoring team. The curriculum and evaluation programs for
this program are built upon several very successful T32 and K-12 program, including our HEAL Pain K-12."

This proposal is the renewal of an initiative for predoctoral training in Tropical Infectious Diseases, now called
The Graduate Program in Tropical Infectious Diseases (GPiTID) and requests funding for six trainees for five
years. Since its start in 2001, this program has trained over 80 graduate students, including 48 students
appointed to this T32. The goal of this training grant is two-fold: to train the next generation of global health
leaders and to train students to advance scientific achievements toward the control of infectious diseases. The
GPiTID is distinct in many aspects – the training is embedded in a school of public health but focuses on
fundamental scientific discovery using cutting edge approaches of genomics, cell biology, immunology,
population biology and gene editing coupled with the epidemiology of diseases in their natural setting to address
major infections that pose a threat to public health both in the US and abroad. There is a focus on fundamental
scientific training but in the context of the diseases as holistic problems and with an emphasis on fundamental
discoveries that could lead to new interventions including drug, vaccine, and insecticide development. The
Principal Investigators of the program are Dr. Dyann Wirth, Richard Pearson Strong Professor, Department of
Immunology and Infectious Diseases (IID) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (Harvard Chan) and
Institute Member at the Broad Institute; Dr. Phyllis Kanki, Lasker Professor in the Harvard Chan IID Department;
and Dr. Sarah Fortune, Chair and Professor of the Harvard Chan IID Department. In 2026, Dr. Flaminia
Catteruccia – Professor in the Harvard Chan IID Department and HHMI Investigator – will be appointed as co-
PI in place of Professor Wirth. The training program is housed in the Harvard Chan IID Department, centrally
located in the Longwood Medical Area of Boston, MA, and draws additional training faculty from across Harvard
University. GPiTID students complete fundamental biology and computational training coursework as well as
courses that integrate biology and public health content; the public health courses are taken with students from
other Harvard Chan academic programs that draw students from around the world, including countries where
infectious diseases remain a major health threat. The GPiTID also offers students opportunities at the interface
of laboratory science and translational applications through two special programs, one an opportunity to conduct
part of their thesis work in a disease endemic setting and second a Pathogen Therapeutic Development and
Policy Implementation Program. Our graduates show the success of this program: half are impacting global
health through fundamental infectious diseases research in academia as tenure-track faculty, staff scientists, or
further training as postdoctoral fellows, while the other half are applying their scientific training in leadership roles
in industry, global health-focused government positions, and other key health-engaged sectors where they can
create and advocate for interventions to control infectious diseases."
10938276,"Perforin 2 controls unconventional cytokine release from mucosal APC
Project Summary
How professional antigen presenting cell (APC) populations focally deliver cytokines to T cells for shaping the
pro-inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory status of mucosal tissue remains incompletely understood. In particular,
cytokines that lack N-terminal peptide sequence such as the IL-1 family cytokine IL-33 can't access conventional
protein secretion pathways, which has led to the prevailing view that cell death is responsible for IL-33 release.
This project is built upon an exciting set of preliminary data demonstrating that mucosal conventional dendritic
cell (cDC) subsets, in both humans and mice, express the transmembrane pore-forming protein Perforin-2, which
at least in mice, facilitates IL-33 secretion. While in human cDC, we find Perforin-2 expression primarily in an
interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) subset indicating the cDC2 lineage, in mouse cDC, we find Perforin-2 in the
CD103+ cDC1 subset known to express the transcription factors Irf8 and Batf3. Irrespective of this lineage
distinction, both human and mouse CD11c+ cells in the respiratory mucosa contain cytoplasmic IL-33 protein.
Our data demonstrate that inhibition of Perforin-2 activity prevents IL-33 release from cDC and inhibits the
proliferative expansion of a poorly understood ST2+GATA3+Foxp3+Treg subset. Given that Perforin-2 has been
shown to also regulate Type 1 IFN signaling through controlling IFNAR responsiveness, we propose an important
regulatory mechanism exists in humans and mice that is dependent upon mucosal APC that express Perforin-2.
This project tests the central hypothesis that APC require Perforin-2 as an inducible plasma membrane
conduit for unconventional cytokine delivery at the mucosal interface. Three specific aims (SA) will be
investigated. SA1 will determine whether Perforin-2+ APC predict Treg subset abundance in sinonasal mucosa
and define the transcriptional landscape of Perforin-2+ APC. SA2 will define the Perforin-2 domains required for
IL-33 release, the diversity of Perforin-2-dependent secreted molecules, and the requisite intracellular trafficking
machinery responsible for Perforin-2 plasma membrane localization during APC-T cell interactions. SA3 will
directly test whether cDC1 and/or cDC2 subsets preferentially use Perforin-2 for driving pathogen-specific T cell
responses in mouse models of respiratory virus or helminth infection. Taken together, this MIST project stands
to uncover a new paradigm for understanding how cDC instruct immunity within the respiratory mucosa."
10936466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an essential therapeutic procedure used to
enhance the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recent advances in alternative
donor transplantation and supportive care have allowed for a greater number of older adults and those
with co-morbidities to pursue potentially curative transplant procedures. In addition, the emerging era
of targeted therapy allows for the development of novel disease remission induction regimens as well as
transplant conditioning regimens that can enhance outcomes. However, relapse after allogeneic HCT
remains a major barrier to successful outcomes, with recent data suggesting that up to 50% of allogeneic
HCT failure and mortality relate to persistence or relapse of underlying disease. Recent advances in the
detection of minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) have enhanced the capacity of identifying
some patients at high risk of relapse after HCT. Using information obtained by cytogenetics, fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomics, successful outcomes can still be achieved in a subset of
myeloid malignancy patients transplanted in the setting of morphologically active or MRD-detectable
disease at the time of transplant.
Recent observations have demonstrated that more intensive remission induction chemotherapy followed
directly by allogeneic transplantation can provide successful outcomes for patients with poorly
responsive, unfavorable AML after primary induction treatment. This proposal will investigate the
benefit of such aggressive intensive induction followed by immediate transplantation with myeloablative
conditioning for patients with intermediate and high risk AML, when compared to current standard
approaches. This effort will determine whether augmented remission induction therapy with early
transplantation using sensitive MRD assessment before and after transplant for myeloid malignancies
can be used to improve HCT outcomes with the most efficient health resource utilization. In so doing we hope
to establish the importance of more intensive induction chemotherapy in creating opportunities for the
best long-term transplant outcomes for the AML patient. Sensitivity of novel MRD assessments will be
available for study that could determine the need for novel interventions for post-HCT patient
management using a variety of emerging cellular and/or pharmacologic-targeted approaches."
10936017,"The proposed project, NEXT STEPs (Nursing Home EXplanatory Clinical Trials: Supporting Transformation by Enhancing Partnerships) Network, creates a national infrastructure that will address systemic barriers to conducting research in nursing homes (NHs). NHs care for people with serious, complex medical illnesses and are a critical site of care for people with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). The proposed infrastructure is needed to identify and overcome the multiple challenges to conducting research in this setting of care, which include navigating regulatory and recruitment challenges for people with ADRD. The NEXT STEPs Network aims to provide integrated support for investigators to conduct equitable, explanatory trials in nursing homes. NEXT STEPs will create a collaborative community of NH leaders, staff, residents and care partners, clinicians, and researchers to identify research priorities for the field and develop action plans to address them. This will be accomplished via project Cores including Central Coordination; Recruitment and Retention; Methods, Measures, and Data; and Projects and Training. Consensus-based best practices for NH clinical trials will be used to create toolkits and research guidance and foster collaborations. A pilot projects program and research mentorship will create increased national capacity to conduct NH clinical trials. A key component of this project is the bi-directional collaboration with the Long-Term Care Data Cooperative (LTCDC), which has created integrated datasets for hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents. The NEXT STEPs Network Real World Data Scholars and pilot grant awardees will utilize the LTCDC for proposed projects. The development of experiential learning models will provide embedded opportunities for collaboration and learning for researchers in the nursing home setting. Research and Industry/Advocacy Advisory Panels and Partner Workgroups will represent key viewpoints in nursing home care and inform all aspects of the project. The project team will focus on disseminating best practices, pilot project findings and hosting annual meetings, presenting at national conferences and convening regional partner meetings to ensure effective dissemination of key findings. The NEXT STEPs Network will enable researchers from different disciplines to collaborate, with a goal of increasing the number and quality of clinical trials conducted in NHs, including those that focus on prevention, medical therapeutics, behavioral, health services interventions, and the care of special populations including people with ADRD. NEXT STEPs will create strong linkages between researchers, industry, and other crucial parties, fostering evidence-based innovations on key priorities to optimize resident care and quality of life for those living, supporting loved ones, and working in NHs."

10937142,"Abstract
Epigenetic modifications are now recognized as contributing factors in many diseases. Modifications in gene
expression can be induced by DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, histone changes, and non-coding RNAs
rather than changes in gene sequence. Of particular interest are microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding
RNAs that target messenger RNA molecules with complementary sequences for degradation. MiR-718 is a
little-studied miRNA that may play a role in cancers, cardiovascular disease, and neurological disorders.
According to miRbase.org, miR-718's predicted targets include genes that affect calcium signaling,
mitochondrial health, autophagy, and apoptosis. Current literature indicates miR-718 upregulation leads to a
decrease in PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog) mRNA and indicates the role of PTEN in apoptosis and
angiogenesis in cancer cells and the cardiovascular system, respectively, from small samples of human
subjects. The current state of literature regarding miR-718 is limited, yet miR-718 has the potential to impact
various cell pathways involved in different diseases and disorders. My laboratory upregulated miR-718 in SH-
SY5Y cells (a human neuronal model), using a mimic siRNA to miR-718. Our preliminary RT-qPCR data show
miR-718 upregulation downregulates expression of PTEN, DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), Methyl-
CpG-Binding protein 2 (MECP2), and miR-132. We chose these genes because PTEN, DNMT3A, and MECP2
are predicted targets of miR-718, and because several calcium channel genes are predicted targets (calcium
signaling affects CREB phosphorylation and hence transcription of genes), miR-132 would be an indirect target
of miR-718. We also stained miR-718 mimic-treated SH-SY5Y cells with Tetramethylindocarbocyanine
Perchlorate (“DiI”) to determine if miR-718 upregulation affects dendritic spines. Our generated preliminary
data show miR-718 upregulation leads to increased dendritic spines. Because of the potential to impact gene
expression and epigenetics genome-wide, we propose to (1) determine the effects of miR-718 upregulation on
gene expression of miR-718 predicted targets using RNA sequencing (RNAseq), and (2) investigate the effects
of miR-718 upregulation on DNA methylation via DNA methylation sequencing and histone modifications using
Histone Modification Arrays, Western Blotting, and flow cytometry. We expect that if we upregulate miR-718,
targets of miR-718 will be downregulated in RNAseq data, validating those genes as targets of miR-718. We
also expect that because our preliminary data shows miR-718 upregulation leads to a significant decrease in
DNMT3A and MECP2, our epigenetic studies will reveal loss of DNA methylation and histone modifications."

The formation of memories is central to the human condition. It enables learning and the accumulation of knowledge over
the lifespan, and it allows using the past in order to inform the future. While the mechanisms underlying the neural basis
of memory have been extensively studied in the brain, whether memory exists in the peripheral nervous system, and in
particular the enteric nervous system (ENS), remains unknown, representing a fundamental gap in our knowledge of
peripheral neuroscience and gastrointestinal physiology. The goal of this study is to address this fundamental question.
Our proposal is based on exciting preliminary evidence for the existence of memory in the ENS. We have observed the
formation of enteric neural engrams in response to gastrointestinal stimuli and have characterized the molecular,
temporal, and functional characteristics of these engrams. We now aim to build the tools required for studying the
formation and meaning of ENS memories. We will then use these tools in combination with microbial, xenobiotic, and
dietary perturbations in animal models, in order to transform our understanding of numerous functions and diseases of
the gastrointestinal tract through the lens of enteric neural engrams. This project will impact the study of gastrointestinal
and metabolic diseases in three major ways: First, it will uncover a fundamentally new aspect of ENS biology. Memory
formation in the brain has been studied for decades, and its proper function is critical for organismal survival.
Understanding the memory capacity of the ENS would enable us to add several new layers to the canonical functions of
enteric neurons. Second, our study will provide new insights into the nature of memory. Memory formation is generally
studied in response to sensory information (neuroscience) or antigen exposure (immunology). Our investigations will
extend this concept, by highlighting biotic and abiotic gastrointestinal triggers of memory formation. Third, our study may
provide the conceptual framework for an entirely new approach to treating diseases associated with the gastrointestinal
tract – one that focuses on information stored in enteric neurons."
10937430,"Title: Assessment of the Impact of antihypertensive Medications on vascular and renal outcomes in Chronic
Kidney Disease (AIM-CKD)
Abstract
Chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by enduring damage to kidney function, poses a significant public
health concern, impacting around 15% of the adult population in the United States. CKD patients commonly
experience heightened adverse cardiovascular effects, which are associated with an elevated risk of mortality.
Foundational treatment strategies for slowing CKD progression involve blood pressure-lowering agents,
including renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. These medications also exhibit
potential vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Nevertheless, the impact of these therapies on
cardiovascular disease outcomes in CKD patients is still in debate, and the tradeoff between risks and benefits
remains unclear due to limited clinical trials conducted thus far. To address this knowledge gap, we intend to
leverage data from two extensive studies: the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) and the Systolic
Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Our goal is to estimate and compare the effects of medications on
cardiovascular risks in CKD patients using novel and advanced causal inference methods. We recognize that
analyzing real-world data poses statistical challenges (e.g., time-varying treatment administration, competing
risk of death, treatment combination). However, these complexities cannot be directly addressed by current
causal inference techniques or may be addressed inefficiently. Our proposal focuses on time-to-event
outcomes, which accommodate detailed information, including the timing and duration of disease outcomes
that are crucial for understanding the natural progression of the disease and assessing the potential
effectiveness of interventions. Preliminary work has demonstrated the promise of our novel dynamic propensity
trajectory matching (DPTM) techniques, which guarantee further evaluation through theoretical and extensive
simulation studies conducted under various scenarios. Ultimately, we aim to develop user-friendly R software
packages and a Shiny app to facilitate the broader use of our research findings for the benefit of the public."
10937804,"SUMMARY
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a pulmonary vascular disease characterized by increased pulmonary
arterial pressure. PAH patients are young, have poor life quality, and have a short life expectancy. This
daunting fact underscores our need for innovative approaches in PAH. PAH arises from a pro-proliferative and
anti-apoptotic phenotype of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC), endothelial cells (PAEC), and
fibroblast. Recent advances linked this phenotype to a genome-wide deregulation of gene expression.
Therefore, it is imperative to decode the cause of this deregulation to find new therapies. Regulation of gene
expression is governed, in large part, by one main class of protein: RNA-binding proteins (RBP). RBPs
regulate the fate of hundreds of transcripts at once through the recognition of specific motifs that confer them a
high therapeutic potential. However, limited data exist on their implication in PAH. Here, using large-scale
transcriptomic data from PAH patients' lungs, and cultured PASMC and PAEC, we found ZFP36 an RBP
increased in lungs and further enriched in PASMC but not in PAEC. We used computational biology to identify
the targets of ZFP36 and characterize their functions in PAH-PASMC. Our data show that ZFP36 targets are
lead actors in DNA repair and resistance to apoptosis (e.g. RFC3) and cell cycle (e.g. ANAPC4). In-vitro
experiment on PAH-PASMC confirmed the up-regulation of ZFP36 targets and the role of ZFP36 in their up-
regulation, as well as the role of ZFP36 in DNA repair and cell cycle. In addition, we found that inhibition of
ZFP36 in Sugen/Hypoxia rats reduced PH severity."
10940047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Retinal neurons establish synaptic connections with specialized functional properties to achieve
parallel visual information processing. We recently identified a trans-synaptic mechanism that
coordinates the precise alignment between pre-synaptic neurotransmitter release site and post-
synaptic receptors complex at retinal photoreceptor synapses. The key organizer for this trans-
synaptic complex is α2δ4, a protein traditionally known as the auxiliary subunit of voltage gated
calcium channels (VGCCs). We showed that α2δ4 controls photoreceptor synapse formation
through regulating VGCC mediated Ca2+ influx and interacting with synaptogenic cell adhesion
molecules. Our findings have important relevance to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), of which the
hallmarks are amyloid β (Aβ) deposit and synaptic degeneration. Growing evidence supports
that Aβ induces synaptotoxicity through disrupting Ca2+ influx through VGCC which leads to all
major molecular and cellular alterations in AD. However, the molecular basis underlying Aβ
induced VGCC functional change and the downstream signaling linking VGCC dysfunction to
synaptic deficits remain largely unknown.
Retinas in AD individuals also have Aβ deposits and display impaired synaptic morphology and
function which are associated with cognitive performance, suggesting that synapses in the
retina and brain respond to Aβ in a similar fashion and that retinal synapses may provide
informative biomarkers for the pathology of AD. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
Aβ induced retinal synaptic changes remains virtually unknown. We hypothesize that
extracellular α2δ proteins are key mediators for Aβ triggered VGCC dysfunction and that
downstream effectors of disrupted VGCC function serve as convergent signaling mechanism
underlying synaptic dysfunction in AD. The long-term goal of this proposed study is to uncover
the molecular basis of synaptic degeneration in AD and develop mechanism-based clinical
interventions. The objective of the proposed work is to study the role of previously identified key
synaptic organizer, α2δ4, in AD related retinal synaptic deficit and to identify key signaling
pathways underlying synaptic degeneration in AD retina. This proposal is significant in that it
has the potential to uncover previously unappreciated and understudied basic biochemical
pathways related to AD which will stimulate exciting future AD mechanistic studies."

Gram-negative pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to many antimicrobials. Furthermore, the pipeline
for new antibiotics is small and new therapies are urgently needed. This can be especially problematic in patients
who suffer from chronic infections or are immunocompromised. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa
has been identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a serious threat. P. aeruginosa causes
healthcare associated infections in a variety of clinical settings and hosts, but is particularly devastating in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We have been interested in using antisense molecules called PPMOs as
potential therapeutics in these infections. These molecules block messenger RNA and prevent the formation of
the target protein. We have demonstrated that PPMOs can be used to target genes that are essential for
Pseudomonas to grow, such as acpP, lpxC or rpsJ. We showed that blocking these proteins are essential for
Pseudomonas to grow in vitro. We also showed that these PPMOs improve survival in mice that were infected
with Pseudomonas. For this project, we propose to further characterize our lead PPMOs in a larger collection of
Pseudomonas isolates, both antibiotic-sensitive and multidrug-resistant. In addition, efficacy studies will be
performed in both models of pneumonia and bloodstream infection. This process will result in 2-4 PPMOs that
will undergo further pre-clinical testing including toxicity, resistance, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
studies. By the end of the proposed project, a lead PPMO will have undergone the needed pre-clinical testing
for IND submission to the FDA. This innovative approach to developing novel antibiotics, particularly for P.
aeruginosa, could help expand the increasingly shrinking classes of effective antibiotics that are used to treat
these severe, life-threatening infections."

The overall goal of this project is to develop and eventually commercialize a novel Point-Of-Care Test capable
of rapidly and accurately detecting allergic IgE to environmental allergens in asthma patients as an approach
promoting healthy living and reducing minority health disparities in response to RFA-23-003. The burden of
asthma in the US falls disproportionately on Black, Hispanic and American Indian/Native Alaskans/Asians. These
minority groups have the highest asthma rates, deaths and hospitalizations. IgE-mediated allergic asthma is the
major type of asthma, consisting of ~70% of all the asthmas. The most relevant allergens triggering IgE-
mediated allergic asthmas are environmental allergens that disproportionately impact the socioeconomically
disadvantaged population and minorities due to their relatively constraint living conditions, lower available
resources and limited access to healthcare, leading to the existing health disparities. Therefore, a more
accurate, convenient, low-cost, rapid and point-of-care enabled IgE test capable of rapidly and accurately
identifying allergic IgE by overcoming false positivity of the current IgE tests would be a key component in efforts
to enhance healthy living and reduce minority health disparities, but such a point-of-care enabled IgE test is not
currently available and yet to be developed. Under such background we propose to develop a novel IgE testing
approach capable of rapidly and accurately detecting allergic IgE against the common allergens associated with
allergic asthma triggering to address the health disparity issue, using Allerdia’s proprietary Reverse Lateral Flow
ImmunoAssay (R-LFIA) technology platform. In Aim 1, we will Integrate the E. coIi expressed recombinant
allergens into R-LFIA based IgE test to achieve higher detecting sensitivity and consistent test accuracy. In Aim
2, we will validate clinical sensitivity and specificity of the prototypic R-LFIA IgE test as a novel allergy diagnostic
for rapid diagnosis of allergic asthmas in a prospective clinical study. Completion of the SBIR phase 2 Aims will
pave the way for the US FDA regulatory approval via FDA’s newly established De Novo approval pathway for
manufacture and commercialization of this novel IgE rapid test."

JH-E-dARC is unique in highlighting the need and value of improving how stigma is measured and mitigated.
Moreover, along with researchers, we propose to engage a diverse group of stakeholders domestically and
internationally--multilateral organizations and community groups and organizations--seeking to better translate
research to relevant change for individuals living with and at risk for HIV. Our JH-E-dARC will provide an
opportunity for investigators and partners to learn and adapt from existing expertise, tools, and methods
instead of continually reinventing the wheel in stigma measurement and intervention development and
evaluation. The potential for our JH-E-dARC to support these varied initiatives is evidenced by existing projects
but also letters of support from more than 25 partners across more than 20 countries, including local networks
of people living with HIV, international agencies, and university leadership. To this end, the AC will provide
scientific, administrative, financial, and technical knowledge management leadership to provide the
organizational infrastructure to strengthen the impact of the developmental, measurement, and interventional
cores. Furthermore, the AC will support research coordination and collaboration across sites by advancing the
methodological rigor of proposed studies focused on measuring or responding to stigma and structural risks for
mental health and HIV, advancing the science around stigma and structural risks. Moreover, the AC will
leverage this multi-institutional partnership to strengthen institutional and individual research capacity to do this
work in the US and around the world to cultivate long-lasting and sustainable benefit. A high-functioning JH-E-
dARC necessitates efficient management structures and coordination to providing the integration, efficiency
and ease of use that will maximize our center's ability to provide services to and interfacing with investigators,
community groups, and normative technical agencies and also coordinate with other ARCs.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Develop and implement the management and organizational strategy for achieving
JH-E-dARC objectives across the development, measurement, and interventions cores. 2) Coordinate and
manage JH-E-dARC cores to ensure harmonious execution of programmatic, financial, advisory, knowledge
management and communications activities. 3) Monitor and evaluate progress towards the overarching JH-E-
dARC objectives, development, and two research cores including measurement and interventions. Sub aim 3:
Implement a monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) strategy to ensure successful achievement of dARC
objectives, development, measurement, and intervention cores and support continuous project-wide learning.

10921856,"Abstract. The heavy burden of communicable diseases on the African continent is largely made up of
HIV, Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria. This trio of diseases alone is creating societal and economic
instability in most African countries across all age groups, and particularly in children. Most recent
estimates by UNAIDS of the global burden of HIV are that 39 million people are currently living with HIV-
1 infection, 25.6 million of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The implementation of anti-retroviral
therapy for people living with HIV (PLWH) comes with complications of costs and iatrogenic effects of
drugs, and it is not a long-term solution to stop the epidemic in SSA. HIV prevention remains critical to
turn the tide of HIV infections and an effective vaccine against HIV-1 is desperately needed. More
recently, passive immunization clinical trials have explored infusion of broadly neutralizing antibodies as
an alternative HIV infection prevention strategy to pre-exposure prophylaxis with anti-retroviral drugs.
Similar, new and innovative efforts are required to develop prevention strategies that would mitigate the
HIV-1 co-morbidities of TB and malaria.
In accordance with the 2019 NIH NOT-OD-20-018 and PA21-151 that support research training of the
workforce, in this application, we propose to train young scientists in Africa to fill the gap in ongoing
efforts to build scientific literacy and skills for career development to the next generation of
African scientists. As the NIH is sponsoring several basic research projects as well as clinical prevention
trials in Africa, we believe that the proposed Infectious Disease in Africa: Training Symposium for the
next generation of African scientists (IDA) will lead to increased scientific knowledge and will help building
future scientific leaders on the continent. Building on the previous 11 IDA symposia, we now propose a
further set of symposia, where the overarching aims are: 1) To provide cutting-edge knowledge in
the fields of HIV passive immunization and vaccine development and implementation for malaria
and TB prevention. 2) To provide events that can enhance career development of the next
generation of African scientists, including grant writing, poster and oral presentation skills,
networking and community engagement. The IDA training symposia will take place in Stellenbosch
(Cape Town, South Africa) and each will leverage on the most recent reported results of the ongoing
passive immunization and vaccine efficacy clinical trials for HIV-1, TB, and Malaria. Our efforts will comply
with the selection of participants to respect gender balance, opportunity for minorities and inclusivity of
diverse sexual orientations."

Core A – Administration, Research Coordination, and Planning
The administrative core provides for coordination, collaboration, integration, and planning in all aspects of the
research process. The core monitors the activities and products of the P01 projects, manages finances and
personnel, shares program information both internally and publicly, coordinates shared resources, disseminates
findings, and links researchers to training opportunities, data resources, technical expertise, and dissemination
mechanisms. The core organizes working group meetings, workshops, and conferences that bring people
together to share and discuss Program Project research and findings, and to learn from outside experts. The
core also provides intellectual leadership to the program project, including identifying and drawing out cross-
project overlaps and synergies, and substantive integration, synthesis, and planning.
Both the convening and integrative roles of the core will assure regular interactions between economics
researchers, collaborators and advisors with analytic and caregiving expertise for people living with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD), and a wider community of health care professionals with experiential
knowledge and perspective on the treatment and care of people with ADRD. A key responsibility of the core is
to create opportunities for the team to learn about and incorporate in their research plans the significant
qualitative differences in decision-making about care for people with ADRD, the elevated role of families and
other caregivers, and how they weigh the various health and functional outcomes of alternative treatment
decisions, particularly for patients with more serious dementia."
10937929,"Several rural communities across the U.S. are burdened by hazardous explosive waste disposal sites, including
many active and retired military bases on the National Priorities List. Colfax, LA (2021 pop. 2,010, 71% Black,
26% White, med. income $16,687) currently hosts the only commercially-operating open burn/open detonation
(OBOD) hazardous waste thermal treatment (TT) facility in the nation and treats contaminated soils from
Superfund sites, spent military munitions, and other explosives. Fine and ultrafine particulate matter (PM) is
emitted during TT of Superfund hazardous wastes and military munitions. Colfax residents living immediately
south of the TT facility solicited our assistance after enduring health impacts including chloracne, cancers, and
thyroid, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases. During our 2022-23 community-based sampling campaign in
Colfax, we detected environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
dioxins, and furans in fine and coarse PM samples and collected urine, nail, and dust samples. Beginning
December 26, 2023, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality will prohibit OBOD, to be replaced with
a closed-burn containment system (CBCS) no earlier than 2025. OBOD prohibition aligns with EPA’s efforts
to replace OBOD with CBCS, representing an important inflection point in energetic waste management
that requires surveillance to ensure that community exposures are sufficiently minimized. However, even
CBCS may incur risks. Emissions of chlorinated compounds and some metals associated with thyroid,
respiratory, and skin disease are still anticipated with CBCS. For this reason, Colfax residents have asked us to
continue surveillance of the air quality even after the cessation of OBOD. We hypothesize that replacement
of OBOD with CBCS will cause short-term increases in coarse PM containing perchlorate derivatives,
transition metals, and PFAS during construction, followed by a substantial reduction in fine PM and its
components once CBCS is operational. Through our work, we will 1) collect ambient particulate matter,
household dust, and biological samples at key time periods during and after construction of the CBCS and 2)
chemically analyze collected samples to ascertain changes in chemical composition during OBOD operationand
the CBCS construction and operation phases. These efforts will allow for ongoing quantification of air pollution
to assess risk of oxidative stress and health effects from exposures, leading to timely reporting of risk data to the
community. The proposed study is time-sensitive, as it provides a rare opportunity to compare the
emissions and exposures during operations of different technologies and during the transitional period
of demolition and construction. This unique dataset will demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of
operational changes to TT, providing crucial information about reduction in concentrations and exposures
following cessation of TT. This information will be essential for management of military wastes throughout
the U.S. to reduce exposures to chemicals associated with many preventable health conditions."
10941386,"Summary/Abstract
Children with Down syndrome (DS) experience significant language deficits beginning early in life and persist-
ing throughout adulthood. Language deficits negatively impact academic outcomes and quality of life. Most
children with DS participate in early language and communication interventions, which frequently include a
caregiver-mediated component. In early interventions, caregivers are often instructed to adapt their language
input to match or slightly exceed their child’s spoken language abilities. However, currently there is no empiri-
cal evidence to indicate what level of linguistic simplification optimizes language processing and word learning
in young children with DS, leading to a substantial gap in clinical practice. This information is particularly im-
portant given that children with DS present with uneven language profiles. Specifically, children with DS show
relative strengths in receptive over expressive language, and in lexical over morphosyntactic skills. Thus, modi-
fying language input based on the child’s expressive language level may result in input that is too simplified for
the child’s receptive language abilities, potentially inhibiting language development in a population that already
struggles to learn language. The proposed project adds a sample of 30 young children with DS, ages 2—5
years, to an ongoing R01 that examines how linguistic simplification affects language processing and word
learning in young autistic children. The methodology is consistent across participant groups and includes using
looking-while-listening tasks to examine the effects of linguistic simplification on language processing and word
learning in real-time. Looking-while-listening only requires passive participation (i.e., looking), eliminating most
behavioral demands and allowing for testing of participants with a range of cognitive and linguistic abilities.
Participants will also complete standardized language assessments. The central hypothesis of the INCLUDE
supplement is that simplification will negatively affect processing and learning. This central hypothesis will be
addressed by 3 Specific Aims, which mirror the aims of the parent R01 but in a sample of young children with
DS: 1) Determine how single-word and telegraphic simplification affects language processing in young children
with DS. 2) Determine how single-word and telegraphic simplification affects word learning in young children
with DS. 3) Evaluate child characteristics that may moderate the effects of linguistic simplification on language
processing and word learning in young children with DS. Regardless of the outcome, these results will have a
strong impact on theory and clinical practice. Project results will identify how linguistic simplification affects chil-
dren’s ability to understand and learn from spoken language. The proposed supplement aligns with INCLUDE’s
research plan, particularly with regard to Component 3, as it includes a clinical trial that tests an intervention
strategy (i.e., linguistic simplification) for young children with DS. This proposal also addresses NIDCD’s IN-
CLUDE priorities by informing early interventions for children with DS, thus contributing to research on the clini-
cal management of communication disorders in this population."
10913353,"Alcohol-induced blackouts (AIB), a form of amnesia linked to dysfunction of the hippocampal CA1 region, often
occur upon moderate-heavy, acute ethanol consumption disregarding age, drinking history, biological sex,
gender or education. Despite their high prevalence and detrimental impact on individuals, families and society,
biomedical research has largely failed to identify the molecular targets underlying AIB and, more important, to
develop pharmacotherapeutic approaches to counteract them. We will cover these gaps in knowledge by
departing from all previous work, which focused on AIB-induced disruption of mechanisms operating at the
hippocampal neurons themselves, to advance a vascular theory of AIB that is centered on the β1 subunit of ion
channels of BK type that is highly expressed in cerebrovascular smooth muscle. Thus, we will test this
overarching hypothesis: at concentrations reached in the brain during AIB, specific amino acids (e.g., S160) in
BK β1 mediate alcohol-induced BK channel inhibition and, eventually, cerebral artery constriction thus leading
to AIB, all these actions being counteracted by selective, novel β1 transmembrane region 2 (TM2)-targeting
agents that activate BK channels. We will address three conceptually related, yet independently testable
specific aims (SA): SA1 (molecular-cellular resolution) will identify the central role of β1 S160 in mediating
ethanol inhibition of BK channels and its reversion by novel β1 TM2-targeting agents whether drug actions are
studied using recombinant BK proteins expressed in heterologous, isolated membranes or in the native cell.
SA2 (tissue-organ resolution) will identify the role of β1 TM2 specific amino acids in ethanol actions of middle
cerebral artery constriction, both in vitro and in vivo, and the reversion of ethanol actions by the β1 TM2-
targeting agents. SA3 (organismal resolution) will address the impact of β1 TM2 specific amino acids in a
mouse model of AIB and demonstrate AIB reversion by β1 TM2-targeting agents. Testing of the three SAs will
be accomplished by combining computational modeling, nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF),
point mutagenesis, robotic/manual patch-clamp, electroporation of vascular myocytes and middle cerebral
artery with recombinant DNAs, engineered mice (“knockouts” and “knockins”), middle cerebral artery in vitro
and in vivo (cranial window) diameter determinations, selective pharmacology, and simultaneous evaluation of
CA1 vessels, blood flow and neuron activity in freely behaving mice subject to AIB, all supported by our papers
or preliminary data."
10913466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since 2012 when the first human case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was
confirmed, the World Health Organization has reported >2220 human infections and almost 800 deaths spread
across 27 countries located in the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and the United States. Although dromedary camels
are the known reservoir of the virus, there is limited knowledge on the mechanisms and factors associated with
camel-to-human transmission, which remains the primary mechanism of human infections. Human outbreaks
and the number of documented cases of MERS-CoV continue to grow in the Middle East and Asia; however
there have, to date, been no documented cases of human disease in the eastern Africa countries where >65%
of the world’s dromedary camels are found. This is despite evidence of prevalent MERS-CoV infection of camels
in the region. The absence of human disease in East Africa may be explained by viral plasticity resulting in
inefficient transmission and/or weakened virulence, or poor disease surveillance and reporting among the
marginalized camel-owning nomadic pastoralist populations that inhabit remote arid lands of the regions. We will
test these hypotheses by conducting integrated longitudinal cohort studies within a closed community of naïve
pastoralists and their camel population that is known to sustain MERS-CoV circulation in Marsabit County,
Kenya, in order to determine the maintenance and transmission of the virus among camels, zoonotic
transmission to humans, and severity of human infections. To determine if the circulating MERS-CoV is
genetically and phenotypically distinct from known virus clades in the Middle East and Asia, we will isolate the
East African virus by collecting samples biweekly from an infant cohort (birth -1 year) of 211 camels, followed by
culture and isolation of the virus to performed genotypic and phenotypic comparison with the known clade viruses
To investigate whether a combination of weak surveillance and poor access to health care are responsible for
absence of disease, we will follow-up for a year, a cohort of 573 camel handlers through biweekly visits, weekly
telephone calls, and access to a toll-free number in order to intensively examine and test them for MERS-CoV
disease. In addition, we will identify, test, and follow-up >4500 in- and out-patients with respiratory illness at
Marsabit County Referral Hospital for 3 years. To assess the risk the virus poses to humans, we will determine
the level of viral shedding in camels, and relate this to the incidence of zoonotic transmission, and types of camel
contact that increase transmission risk. These studies will identify the type of virus circulating in East Africa,
increasing knowledge about plasticity of MERS-CoV and its impact on zoonotic transmission and disease. By
elucidating the frequency and mechanisms of zoonotic transmission, and progression to clinical human disease,
we will define the risk the virus poses to this community at the frontline of a newly emergent virulent virus by
virtue of their occupation and lifestyle, paving the way for development of improved surveillance and appropriate
prevention and control strategies."
10913468,"This renewal of a Senior Research Career Scientist (SRCS) award is to support Dr. Hayden Bosworth
to further provide scientific, mentoring and service contributions to Veterans. Dr. Bosworth’s main research
interests comprise 3 overarching areas that align with VA HSR&D and the VA secretary’s top priorities: 1)
Greater Choice for Veterans - build a high performing integrated network of care; 2) Improve Timeliness of
Services – improve access to care; and 3) Focus Resources More Efficiently – strengthen foundational
services in VA (e.g. primary care). He provides knowledge for improving patients' c h r o n i c c a r e self-
management; translate research to improve the quality of health care, and eliminate health care disparities.
The goal of this research is to develop and evaluate programs and delivery models that can be implemented in
the national VA health care system to improve the quality, efficiency and patient centeredness of care.
 Dr. Bosworth has led over 30 federally funded (VA HSR&D, QUERI, NIH), foundation (e.g., American
Heart Association) projects and participated in another 60 as a co-investigator. Most recently, he has focused
on health care delivery including collaborations with the Office of Rural Health (ORH) and Connected Care. He
currently is the (co-)principal investigator on 3 Investigator Initiated Research (IIR) grants, 2 ORH funded
projects, and 2 industry-funded projects enrolling and serving VA patients (total 7). He is also the co-
investigator on three VA-funded IIR studies, the PI of a U01 and a K12 training grant, both awarded by NHLBI.
The latter provides resources to train 5 faculty for 3 years in implementation science. Since 2013, Dr. Bosworth
has published over 150 peer reviewed articles with more than half with current and formal mentees (total peer
reviewed publications 350 and 4 books); his Google Scholar h-index is 73 and his articles have been cited
more 19k times. Dr. Bosworth received the 2013 VA Undersecretary Award for Outstanding Achievement in
Health Services Research. The annual award is the highest honor for VA health services researchers.
 In terms of mentoring, Dr. Bosworth is currently the primary mentor for 2 funded CDAs and is a
secondary mentor on 8 other career development awards (1 HSR&D, 1 RR&D, and 2 NIH K12, 2 K08, KL2
and one foundation training grant). As the PI of a K12 training grant, he is responsible for training of 5 MD/PhD
junior faculty. He is also senior mentor on the Durham-based VA Quality Scholars program. In his role as Vice
Chair, he is responsible for the development of a master’s and doctoral program in the Department of
Population Health Sciences. The courses required for these curricula incorporate qualitative methods, clinical
trials, health services research, and implementation sciences. Many of these courses are taught by and
accessible to VA faculty. He also has contributed to many national/international committees and leadership
panels. Recent activities include participating as a member/chair of HSR&D SREB study sections HSR 7 -
Aging and Diminished Capacity in the Context of Aging, leading a Durham COIN Virtual Care focus area. He
is also a Deputy Editor for Patient Education and Counseling and co-led a VA State of the Art (SOTA)
supplement on care coordination.
 Dr. Bosworth’s proposed activities for the award period include: 1) leading a broad effort to understand
ways to adapt, scale, spread, and sustain population level interventions for Veterans with comorbid conditions
(e.g., as recent IIR HIV/cardiovascular disease submission and ORH project), 2) facilitate the adoption and
evaluation of models of virtual care including care coordination and the Mission Act legislation, and 3) mentor
junior investigators with interests in care models and implementation. The protected time allowed by a VA
HSR&D SRCS award will allow Dr. Bosworth to enhance his contributions to the VA HSR&D mission, with a
focus on enhancing quality, access and spread of successful healthcare delivery models. He will also continue
to mentor many junior faculty members and serve on the Charleston COIN executive committee."
10913637,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response
rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate
identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer
antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and
3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs
stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients.
Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its
reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen-
independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will
significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve
this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been
explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor
sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task,
we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor
RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools
allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without
knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be
matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific
CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones,
based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of
cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to
track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In
Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using
the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and
accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional
validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to
produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These
Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer
immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify
tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies."

Neuroimaging methods are invaluable for managing the treatment of stroke patients in the acute phase of guiding
reperfusion and salvaging tissue, and are being used more and more to understand the effect of and ultimately
guide treatments in the chronic phase of functional brain recovery. At least some degree of functional recovery
is widely observed in most patients in the months following stroke. The exact biological mechanism directing this
recovery is under active investigation. BOLD functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and functional Near
Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), both of which non-invasively measure the vascular response to brain activity, are
valuable tools for longitudinal monitoring of stroke patients during this recovery period. However, these vascular
responses to external stimuli in brain regions damaged by ischemic stroke are almost always altered relative to
that in brain regions contra-lateral to the stroke and to that seen in healthy individuals. It is not known if this
alteration is a reflection of underlying differences in the neuronal function or simply a result of damaged
vasculature altering the vascular response to activity. In other words, we do not know the effect of stroke on
neurovascular coupling and are thus limited in our ability to use these valuable neuroimaging tools to study
functional recovery in stroke survivors. It is known that stroke triggers a prominent vascular reorganization and
neurovascular unit changes in the periinfarct cortex. It is not known whether the efficiency of this vascular
reorganization contributes to the neurophysiological recovery of the periinfarct cortex, and whether it is linked to
the final functional outcome. Further, it is not known whether periinfarct neurovascular unit changes and capillary
flow quality are a simple reflection of underlying neural recovery or can be a primary determinant of subsequent
neural reorganization. Therefore, there is a great need for studies in well-established and properly controlled
preclinical stroke models to evaluate the evolution of the structural and functional aspects of chronic
neurovascular recovery, for a better mechanistic understanding of these biological interactions, and to
understand their prognostic value for predicting behavioral outcomes following stroke. Our aims are designed to
meet these needs by using a novel combination of optical technologies and a preclinical stroke model. We first
establish the utility of the novel technology for longitudinal imaging of stroke. We will then utilize these
approaches to find the association of hemodynamic recovery signatures with capillary flow stalls. Finally, we
investigate mechanistic explanations for the heterogeneity of these changes."
10911208,"Project 4 Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to develop novel, synthetic lethal, replication stress related, approaches for SCLC
patients based on their tumor’s molecular profiles. There are two major unmet needs for SCLC therapy: first,
the majority of patients will experience primary or acquired resistance to clinically available chemotherapy and
immunotherapy; and second, despite new data supporting molecularly and biologically distinct subsets of SCLC,
there are no established approaches for biomarker-driven personalized treatments (such as is standard for
targetable oncogenic drivers in NSCLC). Many of the currently “undruggable” oncogenic changes that are
common in SCLC promote tumorigenesis through replication stress (RS) and genomic instability. These
“hallmarks of cancer” lead to high tumor mutational burden and chromosomal aberrations. SCLCs have a
continuous high degree of RS due to the universal loss of p53 and RB1 function, and frequent activation of
oncogenes such as MYC. In the presence of RS, cancer cells depend on RS responses (RSR), which are a
branch of DNA damage repair responses (DDR), to resolve DNA damage and stalled replication forks. Several
RSR inhibitors are in clinical development, and we have preliminary findings in preclinical models indicating that
SCLC lines, xenografts, and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) are sensitive to agents that target
RSR or that increase RS or genomic instability beyond tolerable levels. The latter group includes aurora kinase
inhibitors (which induce mitotic catastrophe in the setting of high RS levels, as well as directly inhibiting DNA
repair and decreasing replication fork stability) and 6-thio-dG (distinct from the well-known drug 6 thioguanine)
which is incorporated by telomerase positive cells, leading to telomere disruption, and increased RS.
Furthermore, we have recently found that therapeutic targeting of RS (e.g., by inhibitors of Chk1 or PARP)
increases cytoplasmic DNA, resulting in activation of the innate immune response (via the Stimulator of Interferon
Genes [STING] pathway), immune-mediated cytotoxicity, and enhanced response to immune checkpoint
blockade. We hypothesize that: 1. RS targeting (through Aurora Kinase inhibition or telomere disruption) will
lead to synthetic lethality in molecularly-defined subsets of SCLC (Aim 1); and 2. that RS targeting will enhance
response to immune checkpoint blockade in immunotherapy-refractory subsets of SCLC via activation of the
innate immune system (Aims 2 and 3). Specifically, we expect that RS-targeted therapies will lead to replication
catastrophe and cell death in oncogene-driven lung cancers and enhance responses to immune checkpoint
blockade (e.g., anti-PD-L1). We will test our hypotheses in an extensive panel of molecularly characterized
SPORE lung cancer cell lines, patient derived xenografts (PDXs, tumor and circulating tumor cell (CTC)-derived),
GEM-derived animal models (Aims 1 and 2), and in clinical specimens from an investigator-initiated Phase 2
clinical trial (Aim 3) of Aurora Kinase inhibition combined with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy in extensive-
stage SCLC."

 The promise of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) opens doors towards the feasibility
of personalized medicine against cardiac diseases and for performing more accurate drug discovery studies.
Moreover, hSC-CMs overcome the issue of species differences when using animal models for high throughput
screening studies. However, one of the bottlenecks for scaling up the use of hSC-CMs is their ability to accurately
reflect the native structure and function of adult human cardiomyocytes. Current efforts to address this critical
challenge involve maturation protocols that use biophysical cues such as electrical stimulation or substrate-
induced tissue alignment. Methods for electrical stimulation often utilize electrode contacts for field stimulation,
bulky instrumentation for combining electrical stimuli delivery with mechanical or sustained chemical stimulation,
or genetically modifying cells to be light-responsive. Although we have seen successes through these induction
and stimulation approaches, the field would benefit from a stimulation approach with minimal culture contact to
reduce risk of infection during long-term cultures, as well as a light-based approach with higher spatiotemporal
resolution than electrode-based stimulation. Here, we propose a new paradigm for stimulating hSC-CMs towards
maturation by interfacing these cells with peptide-based substrates that can induce tissue anisotropy and
are engineered to convert light to stimulatory cues. Our team will develop peptides functionalized with
chromophore units and cell-binding epitopes as materials that can be used for light-based stimulation of hSC-
CMs, in combination with induction of tissue alignment, towards maturation. The long-term goal of this project is
to establish light stimulation via engineered peptides as a viable method to stimulate cardiomyocytes and
promote hSC-CM maturation in an electrodeless and non-genetic manner. We hypothesize that transient
charging and other associated light-induced processes at the cardiomyocyte-biomaterial interface can influence
extracellular potential, resulting in the photostimulation of hSC-CMs towards maturation. Our rationale for
proposing a materials-based approach for stimulating hSC-CMs stems from previous reports of conjugated
polymers being used as a photoactive substrate for triggering action potentials of other excitable cells. To test
our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) establishing design parameters for engineered
peptide substrates with optimal photostimulation efficiency; (2) test the cellular- and tissue-level impact of
peptide-mediated photostimulation in combination with anisotropic cues; and (3) elucidate the effect of the
proposed photostimulation method, along with anisotropy cues, on hSC-CM maturation. By establishing the
design rules for the proposed photoexcitable peptides for eliciting combinatorial cues to stimulate hSC-CMs and
ensure their capability to excite cardiac cells, this innovative approach offers a new strategy for a “wireless”
stimulation of cardiac tissues towards maturation, and can therefore significantly contribute towards addressing
the grand challenge of immaturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes."
10903228,"Neuropsychiatric disorders are increasingly associated with neuroinflammatory processes. The blood-brain
barrier (BBB) is a critical modulator of peripheral inflammatory influences on brain development and function.
PIs Jorge Alvarez, a neuroimmunologist with expertise in the BBB, and Stewart Anderson, a developmental
neurobiologist with expertise in mechanisms of neuropsychiatric disorders, have recently demonstrated that the
BBB is compromised in a relatively common genetic cause of neuropsychiatric illness, the 22q11.2 deletion
syndrome (22qDS). While this finding in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BBB-like cells (iBBB) and
in 22qDS model mice was initially ascribed mainly to haploinsufficiency of the BBB-enriched tight junction protein
claudin-5, work from the Anderson lab and others has also demonstrated that 22qDS is associated with
mitochondrial energetic compromise in various cell types. Since mitochondrial energetics are also necessary for
optimal BBB function, the PIs initiated experiments to determine whether mitochondrial energetics of the BBB
are compromised in 22qDS, whether this compromise is likely to influence BBB dysfunction in this disorder, and
whether correction of mitochondrial weakness improves BBB dysfunction in 22qDS. Remarkably, our preliminary
data strongly suggest that all three scenarios are true. If so, BBB energetics could be an underexplored
therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders that involve inflammation.
 Here, we propose to study the synergistic influences of structural and energetic compromise on BBB
function. Building upon our previous findings in iPSC-derived neurons and transformed blood cells, which
showed that 22qDS with schizophrenia (SZ) exhibits weaker mitochondrial energetics compared to 22qDS
without SZ or non-deleted controls, in Aim 1, we will investigate whether this association of mitochondrial
weakness and the presence of SZ in 22qDS extends to iBBB cells. We will also examine whether interventions
that enhance mitochondrial energetics improve BBB function, both in the 22qDS iBBB, and in 22qDS model
mice. In Aim 2 we will use a more reduced system, outside of the 22qDS context, to study whether OXPHOS
compromise will synergize with CLDN5 haploinsufficiency to generate greater BBB insufficiency. We will test
whether crossing mice heterozygous only for claudin-5 in the BBB with those lacking the mitochondrial-DNA
encoded gene ND6 will have exacerbated BBB dysfunction relative to each mutation alone. We will also test
whether enhancing mitochondrial energetics pharmacologically will rectify BBB dysfunction in the neurovascular
selective claudin-5 +/- mice.
 In sum, the mitochondrial influence on BBB function is an underexplored area of study. Since these
influences are therapeutically targetable and since the influence of the BBB on neuroinflammation and brain
health is increasingly appreciated, this proposal could lead to important novel therapeutics both within and
beyond the 22qDS context."
10903165,"Project Abstract
Methamphetamine use and abuse are on the rise. Patients seeking treatment for methamphetamine use disorder
often experience cognitive deficits and an increased incidence of sleep disturbances. Of note, it is well known
that sleep impairment can negatively impact cognition, suggesting that methamphetamine-induced sleep
disruption may be a key factor mediating the cognitive problems observed in methamphetamine users. Because
individuals experiencing cognitive or sleep problems have poorer treatment outcomes and a greater likelihood
of relapse, addressing sleep and cognitive impairments associated with methamphetamine use may be a novel
approach to improving treatment outcomes. Based on these observations, the working hypothesis of this
application is that methamphetamine-induced cognitive deficits are mediated by the effects of
methamphetamine on sleep. Our research strategy is organized around two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will evaluate
the prediction that acute sleep impairment induced by methamphetamine leads to cognitive deficits in drug naïve
monkeys. Male and female rhesus monkeys will be given methamphetamine alone, methamphetamine plus the
sleep aid suvorexant, or suvorexant alone the day before cognitive tests (CANTAB) evaluating executive
functioning (intra-extra dimensional set-shifting task) and working memory (delayed matching-to-sample task).
Aim 2 will evaluate the prediction that chronic methamphetamine self-administration induces greater cognitive
deficits than acute administration, which will be mediated by methamphetamine-induced sleep disruption.
Monkeys will be trained to self-administer methamphetamine (i.v.), and CANTAB cognition tests will be
conducted after one month of methamphetamine taking, methamphetamine taking + evening suvorexant
treatments, or food taking + evening suvorexant. Throughout Aim 1 and Aim 2 studies, sleep will be evaluated
using actigraphy. Results from the proposed studies will provide key information regarding the extent to which
methamphetamine-induced sleep disruptions contribute to the cognitive problems experienced by
methamphetamine users, and the extent to which chronic drug use is necessary for cognitive impairments to
emerge. Further, positive results with suvorexant will support the notion that treating drug-induced sleep
problems may be a novel therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcomes, which would be particularly relevant
for behavioral therapies that rely on intact cognitive function (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy)."
10937930,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) represents a major public health concern, affecting more than 5.7 million Americans and
being the fifth leading cause of death among individuals aged 65 and over. Despite recent progress made through
the advent of amyloid-beta (AB)-targeting immunotherapies, AD remains incurable, highlighting the urgent need
for improved animal models and biomarkers that recapitulate the key processes underlying AD pathogenesis. Non-
human primates (NHPs) are prime candidates to fulfill this role, thanks to their phylogenetic proximity, long lifespan,
highly differentiated prefrontal cortex, and sophisticated behavioral repertoire, which has greatly contributed to our
understanding of cognitive aging. However, the use of this vital animal model is still limited by the lack of tools to
investigate synaptic health, neuroinflammation, and AD-like pathology in vivo. Fluid biomarkers are powerful tools
in clinical settings, yet the effectiveness of fluid biomarkers in monitoring age-related brain changes in NHPs is
almost entirely unknown. We have recently demonstrated the utility of CSF biomarkers in monitoring pathology
progression in middle-aged animals that received experimental interventions to induce aspects of AD pathology
(Beckman et al., 2019; Beckman et al., 2021), but the dynamics of CSF biomolecules in both healthy and
pathological brain aging remain entirely unknown. With support from the parent award, a large biobank of geriatric
NHP samples has been established at the CNPRC. We propose, therefore, to biochemically and
neuropathologically characterize AD-like pathology and neuroinflammation in this cohort of geriatric macaques and
correlate those findings to the levels of CSF and plasma biomarkers. Upon successful completion of this project,
we will have new tools to identify candidate NHP subjects for aging- and dementia-focused studies and a method
to monitor the occurrence and progression of brain aging and pathology in rhesus macaques across all National
Primate Research Centers. We will test the following hypotheses through 3 Specific Aims. Hypothesis 1: We
hypothesize that, by employing a large cohort of aged Rhesus macaques of both sexes, we will be able to observe
multiple trajectories of AD-like pathology, including distinct patterns of amyloid plaque burden and tau
hyperphosphorylation, which may have been too subtle to be detected in previous NHP studies. Hypothesis 2:
We hypothesize that AD-like pathology in aged Rhesus macaques will be associated with a unique pattern of
neuroinflammatory markers compared to healthy aged subjects. Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that multiple
human core AD and neuroinflammation biomarkers will be altered in the plasma and CSF of aged Rhesus
macaques, and these alterations will be correlated with the degree of AD-like pathology in the brain of these animals
in an age- and sex-dependent manner."
10937994,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer affecting women in the U.S. (1/8 lifetime probability of diagnosis).
With the growing number of women Veterans (>2 million) exhibiting a 20-40% greater probability of diagnosis,
this a serious concern recognized by the VA. The majority of breast cancers are diagnosed in stage I-III and are
treated by cytotoxic or endocrine therapies. Detrimentally, these patients have exercise intolerance that hinders
physical function and quality of life. Far-reaching systemic dysfunction is likely induced by the pernicious effects
of breast cancer, which are exacerbated by cytotoxic and endocrine therapies. Such, peripheral, sequelae are
promising therapeutic targets to mitigate the secondary effects of breast cancer and these therapies causing
exercise intolerance, thus improving these essential anticancer therapies and preserving quality of life. Thus,
there is a pressing, and unmet, need to identify the sites and underlying mechanisms of systemic dysfunction
and exercise intolerance induced by stage I-III breast cancer and cytotoxic and endocrine therapies. Reactive
oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS) are elevated in patients with breast cancer prior to surgery/treatment and
undergoing cytotoxic or endocrine therapies, which is a likely mechanism mediating systemic dysfunction.
Critically, the peripheral vascular, mitochondrial, and neuromuscular systems are primary sites contributing to
exercise intolerance in health and disease that are vulnerable to elevations in ROS, making these likely sites of
systemic dysfunction leading to exercise intolerance induced by breast cancer and cytotoxic and endocrine
therapies. The recent development of the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (Mito-Q) provides an
innovative opportunity to reveal the mechanistic, causal role of ROS. The focus of this application is to determine
sites (peripheral vascular, mitochondrial, and neuromuscular systems) and underlying mechanisms (elevated
ROS) contributing to the exercise intolerance induced by stage I-III breast cancer (Phase A) and cytotoxic and
endocrine therapies (Phase B). Our central hypothesis is that systemic vascular, mitochondrial, and
neuromuscular dysfunction and exercise intolerance are induced by stage I-III breast cancer and exacerbated
by cytotoxic and endocrine therapies, and these can be mitigated by preventing the increase in systemic ROS.
Accordingly, the systemic effects of stage I-III breast cancer (Phase A) and cytotoxic and endocrine therapies
(Phase B) will be determined by the passive leg movement (PLM) assessment of vascular function (Specific
Aim 1), permeabilized muscle fiber mitochondrial respiration assessment of skeletal muscle mitochondrial
function (Specific Aim 2), and knee-extensor exercise tolerance combined with electrical nerve stimulation
peripheral/central fatigue assessment of neuromuscular function (Specific Aim 3). Importantly, the proposed
research will address a Women Veteran’s health priority research area of CSR&D and will lead to significant
advances in healthcare for Veterans treated for breast cancer, aligning well with the VA National Cancer Strategy
objective to improve quality of life of patients."
10934954,"Binghamton University (BU) plans to continue the successful relationships with Monroe Community College
(MCC), Onondaga Community College (OCC) and Westchester Community College (WCC) in the Upstate
Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program. Our past R25 Bridges Program has under-represented (UR) student
transfer (93%) and baccalaureate degree completion rates (89%) that are much greater than the national
(31.5% transfer rate; 46% degree completion) and New York State degree completion rates (60.2% overall and
38% for UR). Our long-term success is based on a partnership that successfully prepares UR students to
participate in the biomedical educational and research enterprise. However, we will improve our success with
activities outlined in the following Aims: Aim 1 will focus on recruiting and engaging UR undergraduate
students with an interest in biomedical science research at our partner community colleges (CCs) and who are
interested in transferring to BU to obtain a 4-year biomedically-related science degree. Bridges Scholars at the
CCs will participate in specialized workshops focusing on scientific career choices, peer mentoring, and
community engagement. Scholars will also be introduced to online international scientific communities for
diverse scholars in their chosen disciplines to build their science identities. In addition, implementing
supplementary math and science skills development and CURE-based courses at our partner schools will be
supported to improve performance in those courses. Aim 2 builds upon scientific literacy to promote confidence
in scientific ability in early-stage UR transfer scholars that will foster persistence in biomedical science
education and encourage biomedical career choice. Incoming transfer Bridges Scholars to BU will engage in a
summer scientific boot camp, followed by rotations in research laboratories to promote an interest in rigorous
biomedical research. At BU, scholars will enroll in a Culture of Science course that will include instruction on
research ethics, scientific communication, and community outreach. Scholars will engage in meaningful
outreach activities to support their cultural identities and development as citizen scientists. The last step in Aim
3 will support advanced science education and professionalism to reinforce the proportion of Bridges Scholars
who obtain baccalaureate degrees in the biomedical sciences at BU. All Bridges transfer Scholars will
participate in intensive academic year and summer research experiences in state-of-the-art laboratories at BU
with research-active faculty mentors who have experience training diverse scholars. This level of research
engagement will enable scholars to develop novel independent research projects that can be presented at
national scientific conferences. These synergistic empirically-validated activities across the CCs and BU will
increase the success rate and preparedness of UR students for biomedical research careers."

In 2017, the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) was among the first
recipients of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Youth Enjoy Science (YES) Research Education Program
(R25) grant, launching Chicago EYES (Educators and Youth Enjoy Science) on Cancer. This is a resubmission
application addressing minor criticisms from a 2022 competitive renewal submission that received a score of
14 providing more details on research skill development, trainee participants, programmatic consideration of
different populations and mentor training that specifically addresses the needs of the populations we serve.
EYES serves high school students, college students, and high school science teachers from across Chicago,
engaging them in cutting-edge cancer research, science education, and biomedical career exploration. To
date, the program has enrolled 70 student trainees from backgrounds underrepresented in the sciences and 14
teacher research fellows from underserved communities. Evaluation data reflect growth in trainees’ research
skills and expertise; knowledge and self-confidence regarding research professions; and commitment to
pursuing a research career. Ninety-six percent of student alumni remain committed to careers in STEM, and
more than a third are pursuing a cancer specialization. Teacher research fellows described their experience as
transformational, imparting new insights about science learning and practice that not only strengthened their
skills as educators, but also improved their ability to relate to their students. Renewed funding is essential to
build on the success of EYES. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Equip young people with specialized skills and
expertise to build their competencies as entry-level cancer researchers; 2) Broaden young people’s awareness
of cancer-related career opportunities and empower them to make informed, strategic plans to accomplish
career goals; 3) Strengthen support for young people’s career development by engaging members of the
scientific and local communities, and young people’s immediate families, in their education and training; and 4)
Maintain a robust network of support for program alumni. Over the next five years, we expect to enroll at least
70 new high school and college students, and at least 8 teacher research fellows, in the full two-year program.
Through our partnerships with Chicago Public Schools, the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago Access
Network Television, and other local institutions, we anticipate engaging more than 1000 community members
each year in STEM enrichment and outreach activities. In these ways, Chicago EYES on Cancer will continue
to empower the city’s diverse and talented youth to pursue careers in biomedicine, supporting NCI’s mission to
build a diverse cancer workforce, advance scientific knowledge, and help all people live longer, healthier lives."
10933581,"Social Modifiers of Primate Lifespan
People who are socially isolated or low socioeconomic status suffer from poorer health and
shorter lives. Social factors also impact the survival of other primates, suggesting that social
health gradients are part of the human evolutionary legacy. Yet whether social factors shape
how long primate species live, and how this interspecific variation is encoded at a molecular
level, are unknown. Gaps in understanding stem from challenges posed by collecting data on
lifespan, the social environment, and the pace of aging across large numbers of primates.
Information-rich comparative social and life-history datasets with high-quality biological samples
are thus needed.
The objective of this proposal is to leverage three unique assets developed by our research
team: a Bayesian life-history model; the largest primate social network database to date; and a
generalizable epigenetic aging clock. We aim to use these resources to estimate lifespan for a
large number of primate species, to test if the social environment predicts how long different
primates live, and if lifespan and social variation are reflected in molecular signatures of aging.
We will optimize our newly developed Bayesian Life-History Estimator for primate data and will
apply it to available cross-sectional age-structured data - i.e., snapshots of the distribution of
ages in a population - from over 70 primate species (Aim 1). In doing so, we will create the
largest database of primate lifespan values to date.
We will test if social support elongates and social inequality truncates lifespans in the largest
best-studied genera of primates, the macaques (Aim 2). Macaque species share many
aging-relevant traits, yet vary in lifespan and social regimes. We will leverage our MacaqueNet
database, home to behavioral data for over half the 25 species in the genus Macaca to quantify
social support and social inequality. We predict that species with high levels of social support
and low levels of social inequality live longer.
Using MacaqueNet and the robust biomedical infrastructure that supports macaque research,
we will develop a generalizable epigenetic aging clock for multiple macaque species (Aim 3).
We predict that longer lived macaques age at a slower pace than shorter lived macaques, and
that macaques with more social support or lower levels of social inequality age more slowly.
Our study will vastly increase availability of fundamental primate longevity data, will provide
insights into the eco-evolutionary contexts underpinning human lifespans, and into the social
modifiers of aging and longevity in the most human-relevant cross-species comparative system
for the study of health, disease, and aging – the genus Macaca."
10934168,"Project Summary
The Washington University Program in Principles of Pulmonary Research provides multidisciplinary training for
predoctoral and postdoctoral scholars committed to a career in pulmonary research. The aim of the Program is
to prepare a diverse group of individuals for a career in academic pulmonary medicine through rigorous research
training to address problems in lung biology and disease. The predoctoral portion of the Program engages PhD
and MD-PhD students in the graduate school by direct connection to experts in lung biology. The postdoctoral
portion of the Program enables MD and MD-PhD physicians who are training in clinical pulmonary and critical
care medicine to learn state-of-the-art scientific research, in concert with PhD trainees from a basic science
background. The Program funds seven postdoctoral and five predoctoral trainees for 2-3 years of support before
they transition to additional career development awards. Trainees and mentors are selected to represent a
diversity of interests, skills, and experiences. The Program and its trainees are closely monitored through a multi-
director (PD) approach and five Committees (Program Review, Diversity Recruitment, Wellness and Mentoring,
Internal Advisory, and External Advisory). The success of the program is driven by an individualized training
approach with frequent points of contact between the MPIs, trainees, and preceptors, toward a set of trainee
core competencies. Progress is monitored by bidirectional evaluations between trainees and preceptors, with
input from advisory committees. Research skills are developed in one of three interdisciplinary research tracks:
two basic-translational pillars (Immunology-Host Defense, and Molecular-Cell Biology) and a Clinical-
Translational Sciences pillar. The clinical pillar extends these basic science strategies to human subject research.
The approach provides a multidisciplinary, collaborative, and synergistic plan for research training by bringing
together diverse expertise. For all trainee activities within this structure, there is a carefully constructed mentoring
process that includes competency-based milestones for trainee presentation, publication, and grant application.
To achieve these goals, predoctoral and postdoctoral training efforts are integrated at a weekly Pulmonary
Research Conference. The Conference is the hub for input from an overall Program Review Committee (that
includes the PDs and their advisors) and a project-specific Advisory and Development Committee (that includes
the trainee’s mentors and collaborators). Trainees also receive input via individual lab and group meetings and
additional research conferences. The research-intensive experience is supplemented through graduate
coursework (including a Master of Science) to build specialized skills and mandatory training in the Responsible
Conduct of Research. A set of workshops and retreats stress communication skills, grantsmanship, mentoring,
teaching skills, DEI training, and wellness. Together, these mechanisms serve to ensure high-level
multidisciplinary trainee experiences and performance in previous and present cycles of this longstanding, highly
successful Program that has positioned numerous leaders in lung disease across the United States."
10936857,"Abstract:
Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a potentially blinding ocular disease that affects 60
million people world-wide. Reduction of IOP is currently the only glaucoma treatment, but fails to
preserve vision in a significant fraction of patients, suggesting that other –currently untreated-
factors contribute to the disease. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify these additional
pathomechanisms to aid the development of new therapeutic approaches that directly support
survival and function of retinal ganglion cells (RGC).
Our recently published studies have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of T-cells from
glaucomatous mice into normal recipients causes RGC loss in the recipients. We have also
demonstrated that the absence of T- and B-cells profoundly protects RGC in a mouse glaucoma
model. Preliminary data included in this application demonstrates that peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) of glaucoma patients contain a higher fraction of CD4 cells
synthesizing TNFα and exhibit a higher activation state than those of controls. We further
demonstrate that glaucoma PBMC have a heightened propensity to damage RGC in an ex vivo
assay when compared to controls. Together, these findings strongly suggest that T-cell
mediated damage is one of the mechanisms contributing to RGC loss in both animal models
and in human patients.
This project is designed with the long-term goal to determine whether modulation of immune
responses provides vision saving benefits to glaucoma patients. The objective of this application
is to establish which subtype of CD4 T-cells mediates damage in the glaucoma retina and to
determine the functional significance of CD4 cell derived TNFα. To test our novel hypothesis we
will employ a transgenic mouse model of myocilin-associated spontaneous glaucoma that we
previously developed (Tg-MYOCY437H) containing an inducible Tnf knockout allele. We have also
developed a novel in vitro assay allowing the quantitation of the cytotoxic activity of patient
PBMC targeted toward RGC. Finally we propose to determine the activities T cells extravasated
in the glaucoma retina, as well as those in lymph nodes and PBMC by establishing detailed
gene transcription profiles.
Experimental proof that CD4 T-cell mediated mechanisms contribute to vision loss in patients
would establish new targets for the medical treatment of glaucoma. These in turn will pave a
way for future clinical studies with the ultimate aim of preserving the sight and improving the
quality of life of patients with primary open angle glaucoma."
10936632,"Project Summary/Abstract
The explosive growth of spatial transcriptomics technologies has revolutionized the study of tissue
spatial architecture and development. In contrast to microdissection and spatial barcoding methods, which
may not always achieve single-cell resolution, in situ spatial transcriptomics provides unparalleled detail by
recording the spatial locations of individual RNA transcripts. Though specialized computational methods
have been developed to tackle the unique challenges of analyzing in situ spatial transcriptomics
data, substantial obstacles still exist in accurately identifying cell boundaries, distinguishing cell clusters
and cell types, and understanding cells' interactions with their microenvironment. In this project, we
propose to develop a suite of computational tools to address these challenges. First, we will develop a
generally applicable framework for optimized cell segmentation that integrates RNA spatial location
information with imaging information, capitalizing on the latest segmentation algorithms, such as those
based on transformers. To evaluate their performances, we will generate a benchmarking dataset by
manually annotating cell boundaries in real in situ data from various tissues and disease conditions.
Second, we will establish a framework of cell clustering and cell type annotations for in situ data,
blending gene expression information with cell morphology and cell density information learned from
images. We will also test different combinations of computational methods for data transformation,
dimension reduction, and clustering. The performance will be evaluated on simulated datasets derived from
single-cell RNA-seq data with ground truth cell clusters and cell types. Finally, we will develop a flexible
method to systematically study cellular microenvironment for data from both in situ and other types of spatial
profiling technologies, taking into account diverse cell types, molecules, and different types of cell-cell
interactions based on spatial proximity. These methods will facilitate deeper understandings of the spatial
distributions and interactions of different cell types, providing new biological insights into cell senescence,
tumor microenvironment, and more."
10934815,"Our goal is to increase diversity in the neuroscience workforce by enhancing the success of graduate students
from underrepresented (UR) groups. We aim to create an environment where UR students can thrive, develop
a strong sense of belonging, and grow in self-agency by clarifying the hidden curriculum and enhancing the
explicit curriculum at the forefront of neuroscience graduate education. In this, we are guided by several core
principles: shift from deficit to asset frameworks, integrate culturally responsive pedagogies, and expand the
modes of inclusive community building. The University of Michigan Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP)
includes 40 UR students of 101 total PhD trainees, spread across major training stages from the entering
students (Pre-candidate), those transitioning to candidacy (Early PhD candidate), and the senior PhD student
completing thesis research and making career decisions (Late PhD candidate). The mentoring and educational
needs of these students evolve across these transitions, necessitating intentional programming that targets
each stage alongside activities that span the graduate school lifespan. We will meet these needs with
initiatives and training activities in 3 major areas: Mentoring (Aim 1), Research Education and Professional
Development (Aim 2), and Curriculum Development (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we propose stage-specific individual
and small group mentoring programs, training in culturally-aware mentoring, identity-based mentoring, and a
seminar-workshop series aimed at viewing mentoring practices through the lens of other, often marginalized,
perspectives. In Aim 2, we provide UR students with access to impactful professional development
opportunities, advanced research training courses, and opportunities to build collaborative career networks. In
Aim 3, we address key curricular components that will enhance UR students’ current research and future
career opportunities through practice-based learning in quantitative analysis of neural systems
(Neuroanalytics) and scientific communication (Applied Improv). Our faculty participants are highly committed
to increasing diversity in neuroscience and have exceptional track-records of training UR graduate and
undergraduate students. These activities are embedded in the larger institutional commitment to diversity,
equity, and inclusion. The effectiveness of the programming will be independently evaluated by the UM School
of Education Center for Education Design, Evaluation and Research (CEDER) program. We expect the
proposed mentoring, professional development, and curricular initiatives will increase the self-agency, self-
efficacy, sense of belonging, communication skills, research education, and ultimately the success of UR
graduate students navigating both the hidden and explicit aspects of neuroscience graduate education."
10935002,"ABSTRACT
Pain and substance use disorders (SUD) represent arguably the two most prevalent and costly public health
condition in the United States. While vitally important to consider, the intersection of pain and SUD is not just
limited to opioid use/abuse. Patients being treated for SUD (opioid and non-opioid) commonly report chronic
pain, and, in turn, a history of SUD occurs frequently among patients who receive treatment for chronic pain.
Despite the enormous need for new safe and efficacious treatments, the intersection of pain and SUD research
remains a surprisingly underexplored area of inquiry, which has resulted in excessive knowledge gaps and
limited pain treatment options for people with or in recovery from a SUD. To address this unmet need, we have
developed a new postdoctoral training program: the Promoting Excellence through Pain and Addiction Research
Enhancement (PREPARE) T90/R90 Training Program. A defining feature of the PREPARE Program will be an
emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH) as they relate to chronic pain and SUD clinical research.
SDOH define the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and the inequities in power,
money, and resources that are often responsible for disparities in pain and SUD outcomes across the U.S. Our
overall goal is to develop outstanding independent investigators capable of sustaining productive clinical and
translational research careers addressing the biopsychosocial (emphasis on social) mechanisms underlying
chronic pain and SUD development, and/or designing clinical interventions to relieve pain and ameliorate SUD.
To facilitate progress toward this goal, the PREPARE Program will complete the following. 1. Recruit and train
promising early career investigators (postdoctoral fellows) to conduct mechanistically-based clinical research in
pain and SUD. 2. Implement an integrated training program that will equip trainees with new research skills and
the knowledge to apply these skills to important and unanswered questions regarding pain and SUD. 3. Create
a culture of responsible research conduct and professional excellence to ensure trainees aspire to high
standards of scientific integrity and quality. PREPARE will leverage an excellent infrastructure and collaborative
network at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. We anticipate significant success in
recruiting and training an outstanding and diverse group of trainees during the initial funding cycle. Members of
the training faculty boast excellent track records of research funding and mentoring experience. Prepare requests
support for five postdoctoral trainees (4 T90, 1 R90) from a variety of clinical training backgrounds, each of whom
will work with their multidisciplinary mentoring team to create and implement a tailored independent development
plan as the blueprint for their training. Trainees will achieve their research and career development objectives
through a combination of didactic, research, and professional development activities, and program evaluation
will be ongoing and multimodal. The PREPARE Program is committed to promoting diversity among our trainees,
and the program will provide a training experience that emphasizes excellence in research integrity and ethics."

This is an application for an administrative supplement to the original R15 application ""Arousal
and Timekeeping in a Mouse Mode of Parkinsonism"" to extend our studies to mouse models of
Alzheimer's Disease. Neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s
Disease, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) are characterized by drastic impairments in planning, as
well as cognitive deficits, some of which stem from deficits in estimating durations. Estimation and
reproduction of durations in the seconds-to-minutes range are critical for fundamental processes
such as associative learning, planned motor responses and decision-making. We propose to
extend the original project to evaluate timed motor response deficits in a mouse model of AD. We
will investigate the role of arousal in alterations of timed response selection using a newly
developed model of timed response selection deficits. We will also evaluate pharmacological
approaches to rescue motor timing deficits. The project will enhance our understanding of
neuronal processes involved in cognitive and motor control deficits in neurodegenerative
disorders, and will help develop new treatment strategies in animal models, with possible
subsequent impact on clinical treatments."

research training in psycho-oncology. Having maintained a highly productive research training
program that has kept pace with NCI research priorities and sustained a superb training record in
facilitating the early career development of a diverse and well-trained roster of fellowship
alumna(e), this grant received consecutive five-year renewals in 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009
and 2014 and 2019. It is the oldest research training program in the United States dedicated
solely to preparing new investigators for independent research careers focusing on the
psychosocial and behavioral issues across the cancer control continuum. Now in its 39th year,
this T32 Institutional Research Training Program has successfully trained a cadre of 166 early
stage investigators in psycho-oncology (132 postdoctoral and 34 predoctoral fellows) with at
least 75% of former postdoctoral trainees now building academic research careers in cancer
centers, medical centers, universities and other research settings throughout the United States.
This track record provides compelling evidence that this program continues to be one of the
foremost sites for research training in psycho-oncology. The current application requests an
additional five years of research training support. With evident growth in the depth and breadth of
the portfolio of psycho-oncology research and research training resources, there are now 17
Primary Research Mentors and 20 Other Mentors who provide depth and breadth in psycho-
oncology research and constitute our Participating Research Training Faculty. Trainees receive a
strong didactic curriculum and work in an apprentice model with the opportunity to work on a
wide variety of current and planned projects led by faculty mentors. We propose continuation of
our six postdoctoral and two predoctoral training slots. In the next five years, we intend to
enhance our training track record by some detail here to address developing opportunities in
global cancer control and financial toxicity of cancer treatments, with corresponding expansion of
these topics to research training opportunities, strengthening our didactic curriculum and building
upon our past success in recruiting and retaining under-represented scientists. Each component
of the program will be evaluated annually by participating faculty, trainees and members of an
External Advisory Committee to ensure that this program continues to serve as a national
resource for training outstanding, new investigators in psycho-oncology."

Transcription factors and their coregulators are pivotal in directing gene regulation,
cellular differentiation, and disease progression. Acting as molecular switches, these
complexes shape cellular fate during embryonic development, maintain tissue
homeostasis, and steer responses to environmental cues. However, disruptions in these
interactions can lead to altered gene expression, paving the way for disorders ranging
from metabolic imbalances to neurodegenerative conditions. Recognizing the need to
study the regulatory dynamics of transcription factors, we developed a proteomics method
called RIME. This technique immuno-precipitates epigenetic complexes using antibodies
and employs mass spectrometry to pinpoint members of specific protein complexes.
Nonetheless, RIME and other similar methods grapple with challenges like low
reproducibility and constraints on low-input samples. Over the next five years, our
ambition is to pioneer technologies that revolutionize the study of these complexes. A
significant shift will be transitioning from mass spectrometry to DNA barcode methods,
enhancing signal specificity from individual proteins. Our objective is to devise
instruments that bypass sample limitations and inconsistencies introduced by mass
spectrometry. Present methods only offer a mean signal for all interactors of a protein,
even though it may participate in various distinct complexes. Through our proposal, we
plan to craft DNA oligo-based techniques that amplify protein signals and discern which
members coexist in the same complex. Beyond tool development, we will apply our
methodologies to decipher dynamic shifts in transcription factor complexes, specifically
at regulatory elements like enhancers. Our proteomic instruments will seamlessly
complement state-of-the-art single-cell multi-omic methods that we are currently
employing, enhancing our understanding of how chromatin accessibility, DNA
methylation, and transcriptional patterns are influenced by epigenetic complexes."
10937907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With the increase in antibiotic resistance bacterial infections there is an urgent need for novel antimicrobial agents
that target alternative cellular pathways. One attractive strategy for the development of new antibiotics is to target
DNA biosynthesis by inhibiting thymine biosynthesis. It has been shown that several severe human pathogens,
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) and Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) (and several other severe human
pathogens), produce the DNA base thymine using an alternative enzymatic pathway that relies on a unique flavin-
dependent thymidylate synthase (FDTS) that is coded for by the thyX gene. In eukaryotes and humans, the thyA
or TYMS gene respectively code for “classical TSase” enzymes, which are well-characterized and the target of
several chemotherapeutic drugs. Both the FDTS and classical TSase enzymes catalyze the same net reaction of
uridylate (dUMP), which forms the product thymidylate, dTMP; however, the chemical mechanism, catalytic
intermediates, and protein/active stie structure have been shown to be very different. Since these two proteins
have distinct structures and mechanism of catalysis, it should be feasible to inhibit FDTS selectively over human
TSase thereby interrupting DNA production in the pathogen but not in humans, providing antibiotics with low
toxicity. In the proposed research plan our main goals are i) to study the molecular mechanism of MtbFDTS and
CdiffFDTS catalysis and understand the nature of enzyme inhibition using biochemical, biophysical, and structural
techniques to develop a consensus mechanism for this putative antibiotic drug target, ii) Develop biochemical
methodologies to understand the nature of ligand binding to the MtbFDTS enzyme and relate this to assays that
evaluate inhibition, such that these methods can be used for testing the efficacy and potency of newly synthesized
molecules at inhibiting FDTS selectively over classical TSase., iii) to synthesize new compounds that we
hypothesize to display selective inhibition of FDTS over human TSase, and to create a structure-function
relationship for rational design of antibiotic compounds that may be effective against several human pathogens.
By completing these experimental goals, we expect to discover unique mechanistic features of the MtbFDTS and
CdiffFDTS enzymes, solve novel enzyme structures, and uncover physical parameters for selective inhibition of
thymidylate production within pathogenic bacteria, without interrupting human TSase enzymes. This approach will
help to define a structure-function relationship for selective enzyme inhibition. This will ultimately increase the
overall chances of future antibiotic drug discovery through the rational design of compounds using fragment-based
docking models using the crystal structures that we’ll solve for the MtbFDTS and CdiffFDTS enzymes, and through
future high-throughput inhibitor screening using the assays we develop. Our studies are expected to discover
underlying principles that will allow us to design and test new molecules that will not interfere with human DNA
biosynthetic enzymes, which will potentially give rise to antibiotic drugs with low human toxicity."

Stroke is one of the leading causes of dementia. However, the mechanisms underlying neurovascular
dysfunction and cognitive impairment post-stroke that lead to Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease
related dementias (AD/ADRD) remain unclear. Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia a type of ADRD
and is the second leading cause of dementia in older adults after AD. Although post-stroke cognitive
impairment (PSCI) and eventual post-stroke dementia (PSD) are now recognized as distinct upstream events
that are independent of VCID, it is also widely accepted that stroke initiates a series of neurovascular events
that either independently or dependently, contribute to the onset of VCID. The objective this supplement
application is to employ the novel mouse model in in our funded R01 application to elucidate mechanisms
underlying the pathophysiology of stroke-induced VCID. The goal of our funded R01 was to determine the role
of endothelial tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) in neurovascular dysfunction through the lens of
sex and age in our VEcKO mouse. This mouse contains a conditional deletion of Alpl, the gene that encodes
for TNAP, under the control of the VE-cadherin promoter, i.e.VEcKO mouse. In both young (6 months) and
aged (20-24 months) mice, we have identified a novel phenotype following the induction of experimental
ischemic stroke that mimics multiple neuropathological features of VCID that include: microhemorrhages, white
matter lesions, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. This supplement will investigate the central hypothesis that
endothelial deletion of TNAP is a novel model of VCID that results from ischemic stroke. The aims of this R01
supplement application will employ a comprehensive approach to assess the neuropathological, cognitive, and
mechanistic underpinnings of VEcKO mice as a novel model of VCID following ischemic stroke. The proposed
aims are within the scope of the funded R01 application and will require the addition of approximately 100
mice, along mice already included in the funded application, to complete the supplement aims. Aim 1 will
expand the neuropathological characterization of VCID mice to include the detection of microinfarcts using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Aim 2 will employ a comprehensive
cognitive behavioral assessment to evaluate the long-term impact of loss of endothelial TNAP on VCID. Aim 3
will a mechanistic approach to investigate a novel role for circulating (plasma) extracellular vesicles on brain
endothelial cell function. Aim 4 will use spatial transcriptomics to identify cortical gene expression pathways
that are implicated in the pathophysiology of VCID. This supplement will provide a framework for the
development and characterization of a novel mouse model to better understand the stroke-induced
neurovascular, cognitive, and pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to VCID."
10939804,"Project Summary
 Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating, inflammatory skin condition
characterized by painful abscesses and lesions in the intertriginous areas. HS affects all races;
however, racial disparities exist with increased prevalence, severity, delay in diagnosis, and
dermatologic care in Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino HS patients compared to White
counterparts. Despite these differences, contributing factors to these disparities in HS remain
understudied. Although multiple studies have established the genetic components of HS, only
one large-scale genetic study on HS susceptibility has been published. Our main hypothesis is
that novel and rare coding-sequence variants missing in the current GWAS studies contribute to
the differences in HS risk seen among Black/African American and Hispanics/Latino patients.
Focusing on coding sequence variants is important since many disease-predisposing SNPs
reside in the exome. Using whole-exome sequencing (WES) to comprehensively assess the
associations of rare and common coding variants with HS, we will leverage data from our unique
cohorts and other existing genetic resources including the All of Us and UK biobank data to
evaluate our hypothesis through the following specific aims. In Aim 1 we will perform WES family
and case-control analyses to Identify specific coding sequence variants associated with HS in
different racial/ethnic groups (Black/AA, Hispanic/Latino, and White individuals). In Aim 2, we will
study the impact of HS-associated coding-sequence variants on cellular biology by performing
bioinformatics and multi-omics analyses with gain- and/or loss-of-function of candidate genes with
variants. Insights into the novel and rare coding sequence variations associated with HS risk and
knowledge of racial disparities in HS genetic risk will be gained through the successful completion
of this proposal, which may lead to the development of new HS therapeutics."
10925290,"The Columbia Coordinating Center (CCC) will provide the necessary leadership, infrastructure, and oversight to
support and fulfill the overarching goals of NCI’s Program on the Origins of Gastroesophageal Cancers (PGEC)
and the six transdisciplinary R01 projects. The mission of the PGEC is to extend recent findings regarding
molecular classifications and genomics of gastroesophageal cancers, examine and define how these cancers
initially evolve at the cellular level, and compare and contrast the contributions and underlying mechanisms of
tumor-initiating cells to risk and progression. Inadequate coordination, communication and access will create
significant barriers to program success.
The CCC will provide the leadership and organizational structure to facilitate and strengthen cross collaboration
through trainings, meetings and working groups. The CCC will develop standardization and harmonization of
data elements (e.g., track the cell of origin correctly) across research projects, enable the resolution of technical
challenges, share models and resources, and advance the use of cutting-edge technologies. The CCC will
facilitate equitable and FAIR (employing principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability)
access to in vivo and in vitro models, provide real time feedback on research objectives and allow for assessment
of rigor and reproducibly. The CCC will provide training and support for early-stage investigators to conduct pilot
work and engage in transdisciplinary research to build the next generation of scientists.
Our CCC and the assembled Scientific Advisory Board brings together multidisciplinary scientists with necessary
and diverse research, clinical, database and consortia experience to support these aims. This research team in
conjunction with the many institutional resources at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and
New York Genome Center (NYGC) will be pivotal assets to program success.
Specific Aim 1: Provide strong vision and scientific leadership to ensure the PGEC meets its
programmatic goals. Sub-Aim 1A- training and development of junior investigators; and Sub-Aim 1B-
monitoring research progress and to provide real time feedback that are actionable.
Specific Aim 2: Provide administrative oversight and structure for the PGEC.
Specific Aim 3: Coordinate and organize meetings and conferences.
Specific Aim 4: Build and maintain a data commons and portal for the program.
Impact: The CCC will provide strong leadership with an experienced and multidisciplinary team and an
organizational structure for all PGEC activities to facilitate resource sharing that will expedite productivity,
collaboration, and ultimately impact to better understand and prevent GE cancer morbidity and mortality. Further
integration with other long-standing resources and training programs are additional important deliverables."
10926868,"A Rapid HIV RNA Detection without Sample Preparation
CrossLife Technologies Inc.
Project Summary/Abstract
Early diagnosis of new infections and detection of emergence of viral rebound for individuals
on treatment hold the key to effective management of HIV. Among many diagnostic
approaches, self-testing has become increasingly acceptable in recent years, but
immunoassay-based home tests are insufficiently sensitive for early diagnosis and
incompatible with treatment monitoring. In this project, we propose to develop a rapid,
sensitive, specific, simple, and cost-effective diagnostic technology for RNA detection in
unprocessed blood samples. The proposed technology features unique chemistry innovations
in biomolecular assays (TARA) and our ability in integrating and automating these innovations
onto simple devices with precisely time-gated steps. The R61 phase (Aims 1-3) focuses on
technology development, integration, and optimization; and the R33 phase (Aims 4-5) focuses
on technology validation using archived samples and prospective clinical samples. These
specific tasks will be carried out by a highly multidisciplinary team with well-established
collaborations and complementary expertise. If successful, the test kit will enable diagnosis
and viral load monitoring by individuals in their home or in a pharmacy and be appropriate for
minimal-resource settings where HIV is most prevalent. Sensitive diagnosis and monitoring
enable earlier treatment and reduce HIV transmission."
10923283,"This is a career mentoring award to support Dr. Eaton with dedicated time to support a
sustainable, structured approach to mentoring for herself, her trainees, and early career faculty
mentees. Ellen Eaton, MD, MSPH, is an infectious disease trained clinician-scientist with
expertise developing and testing interventions to reduce infectious consequences of substance
use disorders (SUD), with an emphasis on HIV in persons who use drugs. Her mentoring
portfolio focuses on women and underrepresented groups in science and medicine (URiM).
Mentees will work alongside Dr. Eaton on newly proposed research in the K24 and ongoing
NIH-funded studies in hospitals, clinics and rural communities in Alabama.
Dr. Eaton proposes mentoring aims to (1) develop Deep South physician scientists from diverse
backgrounds who conduct patient-oriented research at the nexus of SUD and HIV and (2)
establish a HIV, Equity and Addiction Training (HEAT) Program that leverages the
complementary expertise of the UAB Center for Addiction and Pain Prevention Intervention and
UAB Center for AIDS Research. This proposal will accelerate progress towards Ending HIV by
building SUD research capacity and expertise.
Dr. Eaton proposes novel research aims using new skills obtained through this career
development award. She has assembled a team of advisors who bring complementary
expertise in implementation science, qualitative research, telemedicine, health equity, and
community engagement. The research will be informed by the Health Equity Implementation
Framework to use implementation strategies to identify equitable use of telemedicine to extend
substance use treatment for people with HIV. She proposes a rapid analysis approach to
analyze in-depth interviews and focus group discussions conducted with key stakeholders and
end-users (people with HIV) across Alabama. Research activities will explore feasibility and
acceptability of a telemedicine intervention with the goal to inform a future implementation trial.
There is a shortage of clinician researchers who study the intersection of HIV and addiction, and
this shortage is especially pronounced in rural and poor states like AL where substance use has
outpaced research on equitable healthcare delivery. This award will contribute to the growth of
skilled and diverse researchers, while advancing the science of healthcare delivery for persons
with substance use disorders in Alabama."
10922124,"ABSTRACT
Some surgery procedures can be made more specific through the use of administered tracers that enhance the
contrast through digital imaging of the field at the time, as done with x-rays or fluorescence. To date, no contrast
agent has even been shown to allow dynamic imaging of tissue function, in a way that interacts with the surgeon’s
resection. This project we introduce a fundamentally new type of contrast, Pressure-Enhanced Sensing Surgery
(PRESS) which is based around a major discovery that a commonly available human-use contrast agent can be
used for stimulating immediate fluorescence when there is hypoxia present. This PRESS imaging allows
visualization of vascular patency and dynamics while the surgeon palpates the tissue, and could be readily
deployed to guide oncologic surgery. This contrast comes from δ-Aminolevulinic Acid (ALA) which is an FDA
cleared prodrug, that is metabolized into the heme synthesis cycle in most human cells, but produces
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) as an intermediate species. PpIX has a delayed fluorescence emission that has not
widely acknowledged prior to now, but is significantly amplified by the lack of oxygen around it, such as the
microregional hypoxia present throughout most solid cancers. The core discovery leading to this project was that
the delayed fluorescence signal of PpIX, can be effectively imaged over a few milliseconds, after a short, pulsed
excitation light, and that this signal provides a direct image indicative of a lack of oxygen inside the tissue. This
is an ideal surgical signal to highlight hypoxic tissues and so the approach and method is protected for use by
our system. We advance a fundamentally new imaging system that is temporarily sequenced with pulsed light
followed by the delayed capture of emission signal over the span of a few milliseconds. Imaging requires rapid
gating and low noise in the camera integrated with an optimized set of hardware, embedded system controls,
and a custom interface. In Phase I, we refine an alpha prototype system based upon a current laboratory grade
system and test the technological feasibility of the proposed design in phantoms and animal tumors. The works
is backed up by a network of leading experts in neurosurgery, photodynamics, oxygen and tumor biology, to
support our early phase testing and give feedback on signal validation and utility for an eventual phase II. The
goal of the project is to develop a fundamentally new surgical imaging system capable of delayed fluorescence
imaging to display real-time oxygenation maps of tissue for surgical guidance, while taking advantage of clinically
approved ALA agents. The technical team involved at the company has an expert knowledge of the field and
has established successful commercial imaging systems in the past. When fully developed for use by surgeons,
PRESS image guidance should be poised to transform the way that tissue is evaluated during surgical
procedures."

Chronic multichannel electrophysiology is a critical tool for examining how behavior arises from
the complex interconnected activity of the brain. The goal of this project is to provide a commercial
ecosystem for multi-electrode array (MEA) manufacturers to scale their products to many more

circuit—the EChip—we will offer a path for MEA manufacturers to integrate electronics directly
onto their arrays, thereby sidestepping the need for bulky connectors or electronics. We aim to
enable the availability of diverse types of electrodes, all with increased channel counts, to satisfy
the diverse needs of experimenters. Furthermore, by developing versatile electronics and
powerful software to interface with the EChips, the EChip-enabled MEAs will be usable in diverse
behavioral paradigms and species."
10921617,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC), an acute inflammatory necrosis of the intestinal tract, is the most commonly
acquired gastrointestinal and surgical emergency for preterm, very low-birth weight infants in the neonatal
intensive care unit. Despite considerable advances in neonatal care, there is no cure for NEC, and it remains
a devastating disease with mortality rates ranging from 30-50%. Management is largely nonspecific and
includes the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, initiation of bowel rest and the provision of fluid and
inotropic support to maintain cardiorespiratory function. Surgical intervention is required in up to 50% of NEC
cases. Studies have shown that swallowed amniotic fluid by the infant is anti-inflammatory, matures the fetal
gut, and may prevent infection. However, there are no treatments that mimic amniotic fluid or its function in
the fetal gut. Plakous Therapeutics has developed and patented methods to extract and preserve the
cytokines and growth factors stored within the placental disc to create Human Placental Extract (HPE), an
acellular preparation of full-term, post-delivery human placenta. These methods yield high concentrations of
chemokines with a much lower pro-inflammatory chemokine composition compared to term amniotic fluid.
The hypothesis is that oral administration of a therapeutic similar to 16-20-week amniotic fluid to the infant
during the transition between birth and normal feeding volumes will bolster and sustain gut maturation while
reducing the hyperinflammatory milieu that drives intestinal mucosal injury of the premature gut to prevent
NEC. Preliminary data indicate that HPE can increase gut cell number and differentiation and modulate cell
response to lipopolysaccharides by decreasing TNF-α secretion. In a Phase II SBIR, HPE reduced disease
severity and elicited no toxicity findings in the piglet model of the disease. In this Phase IIB, Plakous
Therapeutics will conduct a GLP toxicity study for inclusion in a subsequent investigational new drug (IND)
filing and scale manufacturing to clinical lot size to improve efficiency and reduce variance lot-to-lot. These
objectives will be accomplished through testing HPE in vivo in a FDA-reviewed toxicology model and
identifying the minimum toxic dose to support an IND submission that will clear a path for clinical trials. Based
on FDA feedback, a juvenile piglet model will be used to establish dosing safety for the neonatal population.
Plakous must also optimize the manufacturing process to generate commercial scale lots of HPE in a more
efficient and cost-effective manner. The manufacturing process of HPE will result in an acellular, lyophilized,
and terminally sterilized shelf-stable powder that can be easily reconstituted for use. Once reconstituted, the
solution will have growth factor concentrations similar to mid-pregnancy amniotic fluid and will have reduced
variance, delivering a more consistent product. This should lead to more consistent outcomes for patients.
Successful completion of this project will allow Plakous to put together an IND dossier for FDA review."
10921312,"ABSTRACT
Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at treating HIV, it fails to completely eradicate the
viral reservoir. HIV reactivation occurs naturally, as evidenced by occasional low-level viremia (“blips”)
observed in patients on ART. Studying the anatomical sites of HIV reactivation and the molecular mechanisms
driving these blips can provide essential information for the development of HIV cure strategies. Non-human
primate studies, autopsies, and clinical trials indicate that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains up to 98%
of the HIV reservoir and that its immunophysiology could be especially conducive for HIV reactivation. In our
previous work, we found that the epithelium of the intestinal mucosa contains a population of cells producing
extremely high levels of type I/III interferon-stimulated proteins, among them, IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15).
These specialized enterocytes in the gut express glycoprotein 2, suggesting that some of these epithelial cells
with heightened immunity are microfold cells (M cells). Type I IFN stimulation drives bystander T cell
proliferation in vivo, which likely include latently infected cells, thus contributing to reservoir
persistence. There is also evidence that type I IFN efficiently reactivates HIV-1 in vitro and ex vivo.
Furthermore, mouse studies indicate that blocking type I interferon signaling diminishes immune activation,
restores T cell function, and reduces the size of the HIV reservoir. Taken together, the data suggest that the GI
tract, and particularly M cells, may contribute to HIV persistence and reactivation.
Our overarching hypothesis is that immunologically hyperactive microfold (“M”) cells in the gut create
a microenvironment that fosters proliferation of latently infected bystander CD4+ T cells, sporadic HIV
reactivation from these cells, or both. We will investigate our hypothesis by ex vivo studies of mucosal GI
tissues, including from people living with HIV (PLH), and in vitro M cell cultures to model and manipulate their
effect on HIV latency. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether the interaction with M cells (ISG15high enterocytes)
increases immune activation of bystander CD4+ T cells and macrophages using a single-cell spatial
transcriptomics/proteomics approach. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that T cells/macrophages
containing HIV-1 proviral DNA/mRNA are found in high number in the vicinity of M cells using duodenal and
rectal biopsies from a clinical study of 40 PLH on stable ART. We will quantify HIV-1 DNA and mRNA copies
by digital PCR, determine T cell clonality by spatial transcriptomics and analyze the spatial relationship of HIV-
1 DNA+ and mRNA+ cells by DNA/RNAscope. In Aim 3, we will use in vitro models to test the hypothesis that
M cells drive T cell proliferation and HIV reactivation via their increased activity of type I/III IFN pathways. This
study will provide key information about the intestinal microarchitecture of the HIV reservoir that is necessary
for the development of novel latency reversal agents or strategies to target latently infected cells via M cells."

 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents a group of conditions associated with excessive lipid
accumulation in hepatocytes because of long-term energy surplus. This disease increases morbidity and
mortality associated with injury or physiological stress, and thus is a concern for all medical disciplines. Our
preliminary studies have identified a novel molecular mechanism that couples cellular energy metabolism to
hepatocellular protection.
 Our studies demonstrate that ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), one of the two enzymes responsible for the synthesis
of cytosolic acetyl-CoA, can translocate to the nuclei in hepatocytes. Impairment of ACLY nuclear translocation
increases the vulnerability of hepatocytes to injury. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated
phosphorylation of ACLY is essential for its nuclear translocation. Our preliminary data also indicate that R-
spondin 1 and 3, the endogenous ligands for leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors (LGR)
secreted by hepatocytes, promote the ACLY nuclear translocation which subsequently ameliorates the
vulnerability to injury associated with liver steatosis.
 We propose four Aims to investigate the function of ACLY in hepatic protection using cell biological and
transgenic techniques. Aim 1 will define ACLY nuclear translocation as a novel mechanism accountable for the
protection of hepatocytes from injury. Aim 2 will determine the epigenetic mechanism responsible for the hepatic
protection of nuclear ACLY. Aim 3 will demonstrate that AMPK is critical for the phosphorylation of ACLY and its
subsequent nuclear translocation. Aim 4 will examine whether R-spondin1/3-LGR4 signaling, identified as an
endogenous system critical for hepatocellular protection by our previous studies, restores the impairment of
ACLY nuclear translocation in steatotic liver. Completion of this proposal will advance a completely new area of
hepatic physiology and will provide novel insights into liver injury."

The melanoma niche facilitates growth, differentiation, and drug resistance of cancer cells. Although many of the
cell types, including immune, endothelial, and stromal cells, have been characterized, the interactions of the
many signals that directly regulates these niche cells have not been evaluated in vivo. The niche cells also could
expand or alter their differentiation in response to the tumor cells or extracellular signals, and such changes
could trigger clonal expansion. We have utilized the zebrafish to study melanoma. Recently we developed
zebrafish reporters for the signaling pathways TGF
β
, Wnt, and Type I Interferons (IFN). Surprisingly, we see
certain regions of tumors that express the reporters and the Wnt and IFN reporters co-localize. Using a new
system to image tumors continuously for up to 24 hours, we noted small indentations of the surface of
melanomas that we termed “craters”. These regions contain CD8+ T cells that are both activated and exhausted
with dendritic cells. These immune hubs function as a conduit for T cells to enter tumors. We have found craters
also in human melanoma samples. In zebrafish melanomas, we specifically found Wnt positive macrophages
localized to craters. We plan to probe the function of the Wnt positive macrophages and to examine the role of
Wnt in the craters. Macrophages also phagocytose TGFβ-signaled and some Wnt-signaling melanoma cells. We
plan to probe the “eat-me” signals that are involved. We recently have examined clonality using a variety of
cellular barcoding approaches in zebrafish and human tumors. In the zebrafish, we have a Brainbow approach
that uses colors to examine clonality and a CRISPR based DNA barcode system called GESTALT. Using single
cell analysis, we found that the cancer associated fibroblasts secrete high IL-8 levels. Clonal analyses of tumors
overexpressing IL-8 revealed that IL8 mediates endothelial cell clonal expansion which is associated with a
decrease of CD8+T cell infiltration. We have used mitochondrial barcoding to examine single cell clonality, gene
expression and chromatin accessibility in human melanomas. We plan to compare zebrafish and human tumors,
examining spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging, coupled with clonality. The clonality of the blood and
immune cells in melanoma will also be assessed, independent of the TCR sequencing. Our studies should shed
light on how multiple signals in cancer niche intersect and function and will relate these effects to clonal growth.
This work with have impact on the choice of primary therapies or when drug resistance occurs."

The proposed project is a competing renewal of R01AA017608, which investigated the influence of young
men's alcohol intoxication, sexual aggression perpetration history, and partner condom negotiation on their
sexual risk behavior through two alcohol administration experiments and follow-up surveys. Findings from the
original project suggest that alcohol intoxication and sexual aggression history are predictive of greater
condom use resistance and other sexual risk behaviors (e.g., unprotected sex) at both proximal and event
levels. Moreover, preliminary results suggest that emotional factors may play a role in these associations,
suggesting a promising avenue for continued research. The proposed renewal aims to build upon these
findings through investigation of the emotional mechanisms involved in young men's alcohol-related sexual risk
behavior to provide an empirical foundation for developing evidence-based sexual risk prevention programs.
The proposed project continues and extends the original line of research through multiple methods designed to
evaluate distal and proximal emotional factors implicated in alcohol-related sexual risk. Male drinkers aged 21-
30 who use condoms inconsistently (n = 600) will first complete a screening procedure followed by a baseline
survey which will assess relevant constructs including negative emotional traits, emotion dysregulation
tendencies, and alcohol expectancies. They will then complete a 30 day daily diary assessment of their daily
emotional states, daily coping motives pertaining to drinking and sex, and daily drinking and sexual risk
behaviors in order to evaluate daily relationships among these factors. Upon completion of the daily monitoring
period, the same participants will complete an in-lab experiment assessing in-the-moment effects of alcohol
intoxication and provocation on negative emotional states and sexual risk intentions. Generalized linear mixed
models will be used to examine the daily influence of emotional states and coping motives on alcohol
consumption and sexual risk behaviors. Structural equation modeling and other regression-based analyses will
be used to examine experimental effects of alcohol intoxication and provocation on negative emotional states
and other mediators, as well as sexual risk intentions. Moderating effects of negative emotional traits, emotion
dysregulation tendencies, and alcohol expectancies will also be examined for both daily and in-the-moment
processes, and the linkages between event-level and experimental relationships will be investigated. The
proposed renewal is both significant and innovative in that it will address the public health concern of men's
sexual risk behaviors including condom use resistance; will evaluate the role of emotional processes in men's
alcohol-related sexual risk; and will use multiple methods to gather complementary types of data that will
elucidate the mechanisms underlying alcohol-related sexual risk behaviors and provide an empirical evidence
base from which to develop and inform prevention and intervention programs.

10913629,"Annually, ∼300,000 neonates are admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in the U.S., mostly 
due to respiratory distress. After a successful medical treatment in the NICU, earlier discharge to a stable 
home life could improve the chance of survival for neonates. However, the outpatient management of 
babies with fragile respiratory status is challenging in the absence of reliable remote monitoring devices 
suitable for use at home. Due to the small form factor and ease of use, contemporary home monitoring 
devices deploy sensors measuring SpO2, the saturation of hemoglobin bound to oxygen. Nevertheless, 
accurate assessment of oxygenation is complicated and not possible with only one parameter. Therefore, 
in clinical practice, invasive blood gas measurements - including partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), which 
is the free dissolved oxygen (not bound to hemoglobin) - are not entirely replaced with SpO2. PaO2 is an 
essential cardio-respiratory measurement and the direct indication of lung effectiveness. A direct
noninvasive method of assessing PaO2 is PtcO2, oxygen gas that diffuses through the skin. Creating an 
ability to sense two respiratory parameters (PtcO2 and SpO2) with one wearable is unique and superior to 
the current practice of measuring only SpO2, filling an important gap in miniaturization of the
transcutaneous blood gas monitors."

and degradation of the glycoproteins in the extracellular matrix. Hence, glycan and glycoprotein
antigens still comprise the majority of FDA approved diagnostic cancer biomarkers. Our group
has recently developed multiple N-linked glycan imaging mass spectrometry workflows to
characterize the glycomes in clinically relevant tumor tissues, biofluids and cells, as well as
individually targeted glycoproteins by immunocapture. In this proposal, application of a new click
chemistry reagent specific for targeting of α2,3 sialic acid antigens, like sialyl Lewis A/CA19-9,
sialyl Lewis X and sTRA, will be used to improve isolation and sequencing of tumor-associated
glycopeptides from FFPE tissues, biofluids and cells. Standard proteases and new ECM-targeted
proteases will be used in the analyses. To accomplish this, three Specific Aims are proposed: 1.
Isolate, identify and co-localize sialic acid glycoproteins from clinical FFPE cancer tissues; 2.
Isolate and identify sialic acid glycoproteins in plasma cancer samples; 3. Isolate and identify
sialic acid glycoproteins in cancer cell lines with high levels of α2,3 sialic antigens. The
carbohydrate-targeted click capture reagents developed can be applied directly to any FFPE tissue,
cell or biofluid of interest using simple chemical reactions. The combination of tools developed
herein will facilitate the identification of specific glycopeptide and glycoprotein species in relevant
cancer samples which can be applied across the spectrum of cancer prevention, progression,
prognosis, and biomarker applications."
10911229,"Project Summary – Administrative Core
The overall objective of the new UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence is to identify and advance the
development of therapeutic strategies for mitigating long-term, adverse neurologic consequences in individuals
who survive the cholinergic crisis triggered by acute intoxication with organophosphate (OP) cholinesterase
inhibitors. The Center is comprised of three scientific Projects, three scientific Cores, a Research Education
Core, an Emerging Science and Scientists Pilot Project Program, and multiple committees — all of which will
work closely together to ensure success. The Administrative Core will centralize coordination, communication
and integration among the Projects and Cores and foster synergy across the Center, ultimately ensuring the
Center meets annual milestones established in collaboration with NIH CounterACT program officer(s). Activities
will include providing overall scientific leadership, fiscal oversight, and logistical support as well as assistance
with disseminating research findings and encouraging and facilitating data sharing with external investigators.
Additionally, the Administrative Core will coordinate Center interactions with the UC Davis administration and
external entities, such as the NIH CounterACT administration, the Center’s External Advisory Board, the larger
CounterACT research community, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and potential commercial partners. The Core’s objectives are
to: (1) Provide scientific leadership and logistics support to coordinate and integrate Center activities and
promote interactions among Center investigators to meet annual Center milestones; (2) Administer the Emerging
Science and Scientists Pilot Project Program (ESSP3); (3) Facilitate data and resource sharing among Center
investigators and other CounterACT investigators; (4) Provide budgetary oversight and grant management; (5)
Ensure the safety and security of personnel, materials, data and facilities; (6) Pursue intellectual property (IP)
strategies, and identify, engage and coordinate communications with commercial partners; and (7) Coordinate
with FDA, BARDA and other federal government agencies."
10911230,"Project Summary – Research Education Core (REC)
The training of future leaders in the development of medical countermeasures for chemical threat agents is
critical to the success of the CounterACT program and to national emergency response and preparedness
efforts. The overall mission of the Research Education Core (REC) is to create a diverse array of human
resources capable of conducting team-based interdisciplinary research focused on addressing the complex
problems posed by chemical threat agents. Advanced training in pharmacology, toxicology, neuroscience, and
drug discovery will be provided to a diverse generation of researchers, more specifically, technicians, medical
and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early stage investigators within and outside the UC Davis
CounterACT Center. Accordingly, the REC will interact with all Cores and Projects of the Center. A major
emphasis will be enhancing the diversity, and recruitment of trainees and mentors from underrepresented and
socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds into the Center.
The educational research environment at UC Davis is well suited for the CounterACT Center. UC Davis is a
national leader in pharmacology and toxicology, and CounterACT faculty have expertise in fundamental
pharmacology, toxicology, medicinal chemistry, drug screening, mechanistic target identification, animal models
of disease, advanced imaging, biostatistics as well as preclinical testing and participation in clinical trials. The
REC will facilitate the transfer of this knowledge to trainees and promote the advancement of trainees’ careers
by providing opportunities to be mentored by and learn from both internal and external scientists with expertise
relevant to the CounterACT mission.
The REC has three main objectives: (1) Develop skill sets necessary for the study of toxicology, pharmacology,
drug discovery, neuroscience, and neurological disorders related to chemical threat agents. First, hands-
on interdisciplinary and collaborative research training primarily in the laboratories of the Project and Core
Leaders will be provided. Second, specialized didactic training in areas relevant to the Center’s mission will be
accomplished via workshops, seminars, and specialized coursework. (2) Enhance the recruitment of graduate
students and faculty from underrepresented backgrounds into the UC Davis CounterACT Center by leveraging
well established undergraduate, graduate, and faculty STEM-related recruiting and retention programs on
campus. (3) Evaluate the activities of the REC to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement.
By fulfilling these objectives, the REC will accomplish its goal of developing a diverse group of scientists with
broader understanding of the concepts, challenges, and opportunities in drug discovery and development of
medical countermeasures of chemical threat agents."
10911232,"Project Summary – Analytical and Medicinal Chemistry (AMC) Core – Core A
The overall goal of the new UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence is to identify and advance novel
therapeutic strategies that, when administered as an adjunct to in-field standard-of-care (SOC) for acute
organophosphate (OP) intoxication, will mitigate the onset and/or severity of long-term, adverse neurological
consequences. Current medical countermeasures, which include the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine,
combined with an oxime, to reactivate acetylcholinesterase and a benzodiazepine to terminate status epilepticus,
do not sufficiently protect against the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and cognitive
deficits unless administered in the first 15-min after exposure. Therefore, there exists an urgent need to identify
novel therapeutic strategies that can be deployed at delayed times post-exposure to mitigate the chronic,
adverse neurological sequelae of acute OP intoxication. There is also a critical need to identify quantifiable and
predictive biomarkers that are suitable for evaluating potential therapeutics and that allow prediction of which
patients are at increased risk of developing persistent seizure disorders and cognitive dysfunction and would
most benefit from post-exposure treatment.
The Analytical and Medicinal Chemistry Core (Core A) will function as an integral component of the Center by
supporting and collaborating with all three Projects and the Neuroimaging Core. In general support of the entire
Center, Core A will perform quality control and confirm the identity and purity of all commercially obtained key
chemical resources and the threat agent diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). If necessary, compounds will be
purified in-house before release to the Projects. Core A will further support the Projects by developing liquid
chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS) methods for the detection of antiseizure drugs, anti-
inflammatories and neuroprotectants and their metabolites in plasma and tissues, and generate pharmacokinetic
data to inform dose selection and demonstrate target engagement. Core A will use its medicinal chemistry
expertise to synthesize small molecule probes and potential novel therapeutics as required by the Projects.
Additionally, Core A will closely work with the Projects on the identification and quantification of biomarkers for
seizure activity, neuroinflammation and changes in blood-brain-barrier permeability and their amelioration by
potential therapeutics. Oversight and management of the Core will be provided by Core Lead, Heike Wulff, PhD,
Professor of Pharmacology at UC Davis with broad expertise in pharmacology and medicinal chemistry; and
Core Co-Lead, Jun Yang, PhD, Research Scientist at UC Davis, with extensive expertise in mass spectrometry
and both global and targeted metabolomics, particularly lipid mediators. By providing analytical and medicinal
chemistry expertise, and dedicated services of probe and reagent design, chemical resource verification, biomarker
identification/detection and PK/PD analysis, Core A will ensure consistency, scientific rigor, efficiency, and
reproducibility in research across the Projects of the UC Davis CounterACT Center."
10911233,"Project Summary – Neuroimaging Core – Core B
The Neuroimaging Core will provide UC Davis CounterACT Center investigators with outstanding resources in
the rapidly evolving field of neuroimaging technologies, for which there is strong demand by all three scientific
Projects. Neuroimaging tools provide one of the best modern means for examining the pathophysiology of
disorders that affect the brain. Center investigators have previously shown the benefits of neuroimaging
technologies for evaluating the short- and long-term consequences of acute organophosphate intoxication on
the brain and identifying effective therapeutic strategies that mitigate the resulting neuropathology. The
Neuroimaging Core will capitalize on these previous successes and provide state-of-the-art equipment for
neuroimaging spanning microscopic to whole brain in vivo imaging, and dedicated expertise in image acquisition,
analysis and the development and validation of imaging biomarkers to support the scientific Projects. The
neuroimaging resources provided will include modalities focused on structural neuroimaging, such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and X-ray computed tomography (CT), functional and molecular imaging, such as MRI
and positron emission tomography (PET), and correlative cellular high-content brightfield and fluorescence tissue
imaging. Oversight and management of the Neuroimaging Core will be provided by Core Lead, Abhijit Chaudhari,
PhD, Professor of Radiology and the Director of the UC Davis Center for Molecular and Genomic Imaging
(CMGI), with over 15 years of experience in animal and human imaging with various imaging modalities,
quantitative imaging science, imaging biomarker design and validation and medical image processing; and Core
Co-Lead, Brad Hobson, PhD, Research Scientist at the CMGI, who has extensive training in neurotoxicology,
pharmacology and the validation of ex vivo and in vivo neuroimaging methods in the context of organophosphate
exposure. The objectives of the Neuroimaging Core are to: (1) provide Center investigators with access to a
wide array of neuroimaging technologies ranging from cellular imaging to macroscopic in vivo structural,
functional, and molecular imaging in pursuit of the scientific aims of the Projects; (2) develop and deploy
advanced imaging technologies that will enhance Center investigators’ research endeavors.; and (3) contribute
to the research education mission of the Center by providing virtual and hands-on training in the utilization of
imaging methods, data acquisition, and image analysis. By providing neuroimaging expertise, the Core will
ensure that imaging studies by the UC Davis Center investigators are designed, implemented, and analyzed
rigorously to ensure transparency, reproducibility and future translatability to humans."
10911234,"Project Summary – Statistics Core – Core C
Promoting scientific rigor and reproducibility has become an urgent priority in preclinical research in recent years.
Important features of these concepts include sound study design, statistical analysis, and the validation and
sharing of study data and statistical programming code to facilitate replication and reproduction, and to maximize
impact by pooling data in repositories that aim to facilitate discovery. The Statistics Core’s primary objectives are
to (i) provide targeted research support in study design and data analysis; (ii) establish data standards and
procedures for data storage to promote adherence to FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability,
Reusability) Principles, facilitate efficient research collaboration, data sharing and reproducibility of research
results; and (iii) advance the educational mission of the Center (in close partnership with the Research Education
Core) by providing training to investigators, research staff and graduate students on study design and statistical
methods tailored to CounterACT scientific objectives. Using a proven approach that has served us well for the
previous UC Davis CounterACT Center, the Core will provide statistical research support in rigorous
experimental design, sample size estimation, and effective data analysis methods to minimize bias and to ensure
robust results. The Statistics Core consists of a trio of highly experienced CounterACT statisticians, including
two full professors. All three have considerable (10+ years) experience in collaborative multidisciplinary research.
To distribute efforts across Core C’s faculty statisticians and analytical staff, and to encourage collaboration
across Projects and Cores, each experiment is assigned a primary faculty statistician and analyst to support the
design, data collection, data analysis, and reporting of results. Brief weekly meetings of Core C personnel provide
an efficient forum to discuss statistical and database management challenges and to share ideas and methods
for addressing them. By providing targeted statistical expertise, analytical and data storage support, and training,
the Statistics Core will promote the scientific rigor, reproducibility, and ultimate impact of research findings by
the UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence."
10911235,"Project Summary – Project 1
Convulsant chemical threat agents, such as the organophosphates (OPs) diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and
soman, can trigger seizures that progress to life-threatening status epilepticus (SE). Survivors face significant,
long-term morbidity, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and mild-to-severe memory loss. Current
medical countermeasures fail to sufficiently protect against these long-term neurological deficits. Project 1 will
use a well-established rat model of acute DFP intoxication to test the hypothesis that therapies that promote
resolution of inflammation when administered as adjuncts to standard of care will mitigate the long-term, adverse
neurological consequences of acute OP intoxication. The scientific premise for this hypothesis includes
experimental evidence that: (1) acute OP intoxication triggers a robust neuroinflammatory response in multiple
brain regions that persists for up to 6 months; and (2) pro-inflammatory signaling is causally linked to
epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in non-OP models. We will focus our initial efforts on lipid mediators
of inflammation. Our analyses of the brain lipidome in rats acutely intoxicated with DFP suggests two potential
therapeutic approaches: inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to block the formation of prostaglandins, and
inhibiting the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to stabilize anti-inflammatory lipid mediators. A small
molecule inhibitor of sEH (sEHI) developed at UC Davis has been shown to significantly attenuate SRS in
preclinical models of pilocarpine-induced epilepsy, improve cognitive function in preclinical models of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), and reduce pathology in models of AD, stroke and Parkinson’s disease. Our preliminary data
suggest that sEHI also mitigates neuroinflammation and terminates SRS in the rat DFP model. Our goals are to:
(1) Characterize the spatiotemporal profile of neuroinflammation in male and female rats following acute DFP
intoxication in order to identify therapeutic targets, determine therapeutic windows, and develop translatable
biomarkers of inflammation that predict SRS and/or cognitive dysfunction. (2) Evaluate the neuroprotective
efficacy of sEHI and other compounds that target dysregulated inflammatory mediators in male and female rats
acutely intoxicated with DFP. (3) Determine the safety of therapeutic lead(s) and their efficacy in protecting
against adverse neurological consequences in a rat model of acute soman intoxication. If successful, Project 1
will identify novel therapeutic lead(s) that improve long-term neurological outcomes when used as adjuncts to
standard of care, as well as biomarkers that identify individuals at increased risk for developing SRS and/or
cognitive deficits following acute OP intoxication."
10911236,"Project Summary – Project 2
Organophosphates (OPs) such as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) are convulsant chemical threat agents that
can trigger seizures that progress to life-threatening status epilepticus (SE). The current standard of care (SOC)
for acute exposure focuses on the termination of SE but not necessarily on the protection against long-term
adverse neurological consequences often observed in survivors. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction as a
consequence of acute OP intoxication has not been rigorously evaluated despite the possible relevance of BBB
integrity in preventing neurological pathologies that can arise following various brain insults including chemical
toxicosis. Moreover, the efficacy of therapeutic strategies that prevent or reverse BBB disruption to mitigate
spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) and cognitive dysfunction following OP-induced cholinergic crisis has not
been explored, even though there is a dire need to find new therapies that can address the limitations of the
current SOC. To tackle these major gaps, Project 2 will use a well-established rat model of DFP intoxication to
test the hypothesis that therapies that reverse BBB dysfunction when administered as adjuncts to SOC will
mitigate the long-term, adverse neurological consequences of OP intoxication. The scientific premise supporting
this hypothesis includes preliminary evidence demonstrating: (1) BBB leakage and the presence of
microhemorrhages in brains of rats acutely intoxicated with DFP as measured by gadolinium-contrast MRI; (2)
increased activity of known mediators of BBB disruption following acute DFP intoxication, consistent with the
hypothesis that TGFβ signaling could be involved in the long-term adverse neurological effects triggered by DFP
intoxication; and (3) blocking calpain proteolytic activity may prevent epileptogenesis. Our goals are to
characterize the spatiotemporal progression of BBB dysfunction following acute OP intoxication, identify the
mechanisms and engagement of therapeutic targets contributing to OP-induced BBB/neurovascular dysfunction
and determine the efficacy, safety and broad-spectrum activity of the therapeutic candidates (compound 10357
- promotes cell death of PAI-1-tPA+GFAP-astrocytes, IPW-5371 - TGFβ receptor 1 & 2 inhibitor, and MDL-28170
- calpain inhibitor). If successful, this Project could be a game-changer, since it will determine translational
biomarkers for identifying individuals at risk of developing chronic adverse neurological effects and identify
therapeutic candidates to improve long-term neurological outcome(s) when used as adjunctive therapy to SOC.
Moreover, given the similarities between the OP intoxication model and other general models of epilepsy, the
possible targets and/or therapies discovered could have broader application toward other epileptogenic injuries.
The exceptional integration of the experimental design, including the DFP model and the behavorial readouts,
across all three Projects will generate meaningful interactions and foster data sharing for greater impact."
10911237,"Project Summary – Project 3
Both clinical and preclinical data clearly demonstrate that survivors of OP-induced status epilepticus (SE) can
develop persistent neuropathology, spontaneous recurring seizures (SRS) and cognitive dysfunction. Current
standard-of-care (SOC) for acute OP intoxication includes the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine,
combined with an oxime, such as pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM) to reactivate acetylcholinesterase and finally a
benzodiazepine to increase inhibitory tone. However, it is now clear that the potential for SOC to prevent SE or
to counteract the downstream consequences of the OP-induced cholinergic storm rapidly diminishes with time.
Specifically, immediate treatment with atropine and 2-PAM can increase viability, but does not prevent a
transition into SE. Once in SE, the potential for benzodiazepines to interrupt seizures and protect against ongoing
cell death quickly declines. It is also clear that as the interval between acute intoxication and treatment increases,
the severity of the corresponding chronic neurological deficits increases as well. It is likely that following a mass
casualty event, treatment of civilians exposed to chemical threat agents is going to fall outside of the optimal
therapeutic window, increasing the likelihood that they will develop persistent SRS and cognitive disorders.
Therefore, there is a clear need to identify biological markers to identify those individuals with the highest risk of
developing long-term morbidity and also to move beyond the management of acute OP intoxication in the field,
and to investigate therapeutic strategies for managing chronic neurological sequelae, including SRS and
cognitive dysfunction. In Project 3, we will first evaluate the natural history of acute DFP intoxication. This will
include a rigorous assessment of neural oscillations recorded from depth and cortical electrodes over the course
of four months following injury, the quantification of SRS and also evaluation of both a standard battery of
cognitive outcomes (Y-maze, novel object recognition and contextual fear conditioning) and also translationally
relevant touchscreen behaviors (that evaluate memory, executive function, and attention). We will then evaluate
four therapeutic candidates for their potential to modulate excitability, restore oscillations, reduce seizures and
improve cognition. These candidates include: (i) FDA-approved lacosamide, which enhances the slow
inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav); (ii) FDA-approved riluzole, which blocks Nav, but also
enhances the activity of small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) and also glutamine
transport; (iii) SKA-19, a mixed Nav blocker and KCa activator; and (iv) NS13001, a relatively selective KCa
activator. Finally, we will determine the potential of combinatorial therapy including one of the above therapeutic
candidates with theta frequency deep brain stimulation to further manage the chronic neurological outcomes
associated with acute OP intoxication. Ultimately, Project 3 will uncover molecular mechanisms of toxicity and
potentially identify novel therapeutic targets to prevent (with acute delivery of identified therapies) or treat (with
chronic delivery) the devastating long-term neurological sequelae, including SRS and cognitive dysfunction."

10935519,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Overall Program Project
This Program Project seeks to understand features of care integration in oncology that are associated with
higher-quality care delivery and better outcomes for individuals with cancer. Mergers and acquisitions (a form
of structural integration) among care delivery organizations have increased substantially in the past decade,
particularly in oncology. Yet, such ownership changes are only one form of structural integration; structural
features such as co-location, referral networks, and geographic reach also influence care delivery. Moreover,
other forms of integration, including functional, normative, interpersonal, and process integration, are also
important for organizations to provide integrated care. Structural integration via ownership changes is unlikely
to lead directly to better care delivery on its own. Learning how organizations engage in various forms of
integration is critical to understanding how different types of integration influence care. In this Program Project,
we propose a novel research effort with four interrelated Projects reflecting different types of organizations that
deliver cancer care. The organizations include health systems, independent oncology practices, post-acute
care and hospice entities, and specialty pharmacies. Project teams will collect primary data from case studies
and surveys and use administrative data from public and commercial insurers to explore the following aims:
Aim 1. Using case studies, adapt an existing conceptual framework and describe key forms of care integration
beyond structure (i.e., functional, normative, interpersonal, process) for oncology care that are most relevant
for integrated patient care experiences across settings and across the cancer continuum. Identify mechanisms
through which forms of integration may produce integrated patient care and better and more equitable (i.e.,
narrowing gaps in receipt of high-quality care for marginalized groups) outcomes.
Aim 2. Measure and compare oncology care integration across settings and assess how these key forms of
integration are associated with one another. Assess how structural features, practice factors (e.g., proportion
marginalized patients), and market factors relate to non-structural forms of integration (functional, normative,
interpersonal and process).
Aim 3. Assess the association of key forms of integration with utilization, spending, and high-quality and
equitable care within and across care settings, including health care systems, independent oncology practices,
post-acute care and hospice, and specialty pharmacies, and assess mechanisms through which care
integration improves or worsens overall outcomes and receipt of equitable care for marginalized subgroups
based on race and ethnicity, residence in rural areas, and socioeconomically deprived areas.
Defining and assessing how health care organizations integrate oncology care for patients with cancer and
understanding how integration is associated with key outcomes of cancer treatment will inform policies and
practices that can drive improvement in patient outcomes and patient, clinician, and staff experiences."

10903521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Significance: Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are recommended first-line as they are safe and
highly effective. Yet LARCs are not widely adopted in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Over the last
decade, family planning programs have increasingly promoted LARCs in LMICs. While ensuring LARC access
is imperative, overzealous promotion of LARC initiation or limited access to LARC removal services may inhibit
reproductive autonomy. Women without reproductive autonomy face adverse health outcomes, have increased
medical mistrust, and are less likely to utilize contraception. Yet, no quantitative studies have examined the
impact of LARC promotional programs on reproductive autonomy in LARC initiation and discontinuation.
Specific Aims: The proposed project will (1) assess whether a postpartum intrauterine device (IUD)
intervention was associated with perceived pressure to adopt contraception that influenced contraceptive
decision-making, (2) examine longitudinal patterns of IUD removal and access to removal by marital status,
parity, and pressure to adopt contraception, and (3) qualitatively understand women’s experiences with
autonomy when seeking IUD removal.
Approach: The proposed analyses will utilize data collected by the Postpartum Intrauterine Device (PPIUD)
Study, a step-wedged cluster randomized trial of a postpartum IUD intervention that was conducted in
Tanzania and Nepal. The intervention involved provider training in contraceptive counseling and PPIUD
insertions. Aim 1 will utilize multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association between the intervention
and a novel, person-centered measure of reproductive autonomy, whether perceived pressure to adopt
contraception influenced contraceptive decision-making. Aim 2 will apply robust survival analysis techniques to
examine whether sociodemographic factors are associated with access to IUD removal over time. Aim 3 will
use an explanatory mixed-methods approach to contextualize findings by qualitatively exploring women’s
experiences with autonomy when seeking IUD removal services.
Fellowship Information: The applicant is a PhD student in epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill (UNC), a predoctoral trainee in an NICHD-funded T32 training program in reproductive
epidemiology, and a predoctoral trainee in population sciences at the Carolina Population Center. Through
interdisciplinary training and mentorship that spans public health, social science, medicine, and bioethics and
integrates causal inference and mixed-methods approaches and UNC’s rigorous and collaborative research
environment, the proposed training plan will provide the applicant with the resources she needs to successfully
complete her doctoral dissertation and pursue her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator
focused on reproductive epidemiology and family planning."
10904106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Outcomes for patients with gastric cancer, which is the fourth-most lethal cancer worldwide, are poor and
improved therapies are needed. While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) extend survival for patients suffering
from a variety of cancers, most gastric cancer patients do not respond to ICIs. The overall low response of
gastric cancers to ICI therapy is not only disappointing in terms of inability to improve overall survival, but it
also means that a large portion of patients treated with ICIs suffer the toxicities of the treatment without any
clinical benefit. Thus, to improve outcomes for gastric cancer patients, there is a critical need to identify novel
biomarkers that guide ICI use and to find new strategies that augment ICI efficacy. The investigators’ long-
term goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the gastric cancer tumor microenvironment to refine the use of
ICIs. The objective of this proposal is to identify biomarkers that predict ICI response and to discover targets
that are actionable to improve ICI efficacy. Based on the investigative team’s published and unpublished
results, the central hypothesis of the proposal is that artificial intelligence can analyze transcriptomic, digital
pathology, and spatial data to guide ICI use for patients with gastric cancer. To test this hypothesis, a close
collaboration between a computational scientist and surgeon-scientist has been established to pursue 3 aims.
In Aim 1, we will identify novel transcriptomic, digital pathology, and spatial biomarkers that predict ICI
response by comparing tumor samples obtained from gastric cancer patients who did and did not respond to
ICIs. In Aim 2, we will use explainable machine learning approaches to analyze multimodal datasets to predict
ICI response. In Aim 3, we will perform preclinical testing of therapies that target pathways and cell-cell
interactions that are enriched in ICI nonresponders in an effort to increase ICI efficacy. Three candidate targets
have already been identified. The conceptual innovations of this proposal are 1) that artificial intelligence can
analyze multiple streams of data to discover predictive biomarkers, identify ICI response mechanisms, and
predict ICI response, and 2) there are actionable mediators of ICI nonresponse that are identifiable via detailed
analysis of the tumor microenvironment. The proposal is also supported by multiple technical innovations that
include the use of 1) cutting-edge spatial profiling techniques to simultaneously acquire both spatial and
transcriptomic information within the tumor microenvironment, 2) novel artificial intelligence algorithms that
identify image-based predictive biomarkers, 3) novel artificial intelligence algorithms to integrate and process
high-dimensional datasets and provide practical guidance on the probability of ICI response, and 4) a novel
gastric cancer organoid platform to test candidate therapies to improve ICI response. The expected results
from the integrated analyses of clinical, computational, and experimental data will be impactful as they will
provide novel insights into gastric cancer biology and have the potential to improve both quality of life and
survival outcomes for patients with gastric cancer."
10904278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and the sequelae of immunosuppression have been a major barrier to the
success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), which can potentially cure
hematological cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. GVHD is caused by donor T cells that attack
recipient’s non-hematopoietic-lymphoid tissues (non-HLTs), including gastrointestinal (GI) tract, liver and skin.
Advanced strategies with more aggressive immunosuppression agents can better control GVHD. Consequently,
cancer relapse becomes the major cause of deaths (>50%) in allo-HSCT patients. Persisting alloreactive donor
T cells in non-HLTs are known a determinant of GVHD. Indeed, we recently discovered that inhibition of
RIPK1/RIPK3 activity in the GI tract reduces both local and systemic GVHD. These observations together with
others highlight an urgent need of better defining how GVHD is locally maintained. A hallmark of tissue-infiltrating
alloreactive T cells is their capacity to persist and function in response to persistent alloantigens. They show
tissue-resident memory T cell features, contain a subset of Tcf1+ progenitor-like T cells (Tcf1+ TPRO) with a great
ability to self-renew, and have acquired unique transcriptional programs for local tissue residence. However, the
transcriptional regulators that control these processes remain poorly defined. We recently demonstrate that Id3,
a transcription regulator important for CD8+ T cell memory response, has dual functions in maintaining
alloreactive T cell responses during GVHD. Id3 restrains excessive PD-1 expression and effector differentiation
of alloreactive T cells, but promotes the persistence of both Th1 effector T cells and Tcf1+ TPRO cells that infiltrate
non-HLTs. Donor T cells lacking Id3 fail to mediate severe GVHD. PD-1 blockade restores the capacity of Id3-
ablated donor T cells to induce GVHD. Id3 represses expression of transcription factors, which promote PD-1
transcription and exuberant effector differentiation of activated T cells, but sustains expression of Tcf1 protein,
which is required for self-renewal of memory T cells. Building on these findings, we hypothesize that Id3
regulates the formation and maintenance of tissue-infiltrating Tcf1+ TPRO cells that are critical for GVHD
maintenance and leukemia control through coordinating the expression of genes engaged in effector
differentiation and memory T cell development. Two specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1
will define the effect of alloreactive Tcf1+ TPRO cells in GVHD maintenance and leukemia control and characterize
the central role of Id3 in these T cells. Aim 2 will establish the beneficial effects of ID3-engineered chimeric
antigen-receptor (CAR) T cells on eliminating leukemia. Our findings will provide novel molecular insights into
biology of tissue-infiltrating alloreactive T cells and lead to novel Id3 targeting-based non-HLT-specific
approaches to reduce GVHD without global immune suppression. They will also identify the molecular
requirement for CAR T cells to sustain T cell stemness and to resist exhaustion differentiation, thereby enhancing
the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy using CAR T cells."

Public health disasters, such as COVID-19, have disproportionate consequences on low-income and racial-
ethnic minority communities through pathways that likely exacerbate disparities associated with poverty and
racism, and act over extended periods. Young children are vulnerable to deleterious effects of the pandemic on
psychosocial development but have received less attention and resources. Preventive interventions focused on
relational health (e.g., positive and structuring parenting practices, parent-child relationship quality) have been
shown to address the adverse consequences of poverty for young children. However, such interventions have
yet to be tested during a public health disaster, much less one with potentially compounding effects on poverty-
related and racial/ethnic disparities. The current application provides a unique opportunity to determine
whether healthcare- and community-based interventions initially targeting pathways of adversity for families
with young children living in poverty can prevent widening of disparities in the context of COVID-19.
We propose to examine these critical issues by pooling and harmonizing seven data sets across four studies
(including three NICHD R01 awards) in: 1) three very different cities (New York City, Pittsburgh, PA and Flint,
MI); 2) that include low-income, Black and Latinx families; 3) involve trials of scalable preventive relational
health interventions delivered in early childhood (primarily birth to 3 years), the majority with a randomized
design; and 4) assess families longitudinally with multiple informants/methods to assess family socioeconomic
risk, parent-child relational health, and child psychosocial development, as well as exposure and experiences
linked to COVID-19, through the preschool or early school age period. Thus, the current application examines
the consequences of COVID-19 for already-vulnerable families’ relational health and child psychosocial
development, the potential protective role of relational health interventions in attenuating emerging COVID-19-
related disparities, and the variation in these effects across timing of intervention pre- and post-COVID-19
onset, experience, and exposure to the pandemic, and pre-existing family-related risk.
Findings will address complex drivers of health disparities and our ability to utilize population-scalable,
preventive parenting interventions to promote children’s healthy psychosocial development in the context of
both the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health disasters, with implications across the life course. In
addition to determining the degree to which preventive interventions buffer adverse consequences on parents
and children, the extensive questions that can be addressed by combining and harmonizing across these rich
data sets, promise to offer the field critical information about how our most vulnerable families are faring
following the pandemic. This proposal directly addresses NICHD priorities for studying “developmentally
informed strategies to mitigate health disparities” of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and families."

During the humoral immune response, somatic hypermutation (SHM) introduces point mutations in
rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes of activated germinal center (GC) B cells. SHM is essential for the
fine-tuning of antibody affinity, the generation of B cells expressing high-affinity antibody, and the efficacy of
many vaccines. Mistargeted SHM activities can lead to mutations and chromosomal translocations that
contribute to the development of B cell lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that the three-dimensional (3D)
organization of the genome regulates SHM targeting and mistargeting. However, it is largely unknown how
the genome is spatially organized across multiple length scales in GC B cell development and lymphoma,
and how 3D genome architecture mechanistically affects the targeting and mistargeting of SHM.
Conventional approaches cannot address these questions in the primary GC tissue environment due to
technical limitations. Here, we propose to apply a new method recently developed by our team, termed
Multiplexed Imaging of Nucleome Architectures (MINA), to primary human tonsil tissue samples and
malignant GC-derived human B cell lymphomas. We will investigate and test the association between SHM
susceptibility and a variety of 3D nucleome architectures, including topologically associating domain (TAD)
architecture, phase separation, and nuclear positioning of genomic regions relative to nuclear lamina,
nucleoli, and nuclear pores. Through targeted genomic perturbations in human B cell lymphomas, we will
test specific hypotheses linking SHM targeting elements to elevated chromatin looping interactions, TAD
phase separation, nuclear pore proximity, and mutation vulnerability. Our study will significantly advance our
understanding of the role of 3D genome architecture and nuclear organization in GC B cells undergoing
SHM in both the developmental and tumorigenesis contexts. We expect this study to establish a new
research paradigm and transform 3D nucleome investigations in immunobiology."
10933862,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine and predict microcircuit changes in
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) during healthy aging and disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), by integrating empirical in vivo calcium imaging recording, computational simulation
modeling, and calcium imaging-based neural decoding.
 Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have suggested disruptions among
different brain regions in AD patients. However, PFC microcircuit changes during normal aging
and AD initiation and propagation, and how these changes relate to cognitive dysfunctions in
AD are poorly understood.
 We will take a multidisciplinary approach capitalizing on our team’s expertise in
miniscope in vivo calcium imaging, simulation modeling and graph theory-based network
analysis, and neural decoding. Real-time calcium imaging from awake behaving animals makes
it possible to directly visualize the PFC microcircuit changes during aging and dementia.
Simulation modeling helps to tease out the primary degeneration and secondary compensatory
effects on a microcircuit. Calcium imaging-based neural decoding is a powerful multivariate
approach that integrates empirical and computational microcircuit data to understand normal
aging and AD pathogenesis processes. Together, we will perform empirical and computational
studies simultaneously to determine the impacts of normal aging and various AD related
pathologies on the PFC microcircuit. We believe that our strategies will revolutionize our
understanding of aging and AD disease progression, and help developing new effective
treatments for AD."

Soil-transmitted helminth infections are estimated to infected two billion people worldwide, remaining one of the
most neglected groups of infectious diseases and a significant public health and economic challenge. Infected
individuals can suffer from malnutrition, growth retardation, impaired cognitive function, anemia and severe
immunopathology as a result of chronic inflammation. Immunity to helminth parasites is dependent on type 2
inflammatory responses, characterized by activation of T helper type 2 (Th2) cells, group 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2), eosinophils, alternatively-activated macrophages, and B cell production of IgE and IgG. These protective
type 2 responses are influenced by genetic and environmental factors, including diet and microbiota-derived
metabolites. Therefore, further studies are urgently needed to understand the mechanistic basis of how these
factors influence type 2 immune responses to improve strategies to treat and prevent allergic diseases and
intestinal helminth infections. The microbiota is the source of various metabolites which can exert their effects at
the site of absorption (intestine), as well at distant sites such as brain via bloodstream. Since various dietary
components, including dietary fiber, influence the composition of the microbiota and the types of metabolites the
microbiota produces, many of the effects of diet on immune cells can be mediated via the microbiota. However,
the influence of dietary fiber on microbiota-derived metabolites and their roles in regulating type 2
immunity and inflammation in the context of allergic responses or helminth infection remain poorly
defined. Our new preliminary studies in mice employing untargeted comparative metabolomic analyses
identified that a high fiber diet drives a significant shift in the composition of the microbiota and remarkable
changes in the levels of microbiota-derived metabolites. This metabolic reprogramming was associated with the
development of a proinflammatory type 2 immune response, characterized by activation of group 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s), accumulation of eosinophils, and accelerated parasite expulsion in a murine model of
helminth infection. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that high fiber diet-induced modulation of
microbiota-derived metabolites promotes ILC2-induced type 2 inflammation and immunity to helminth parasite
infection. Based on these preliminary data, studies outlined in Aim 1 will test which microbiota-derived
metabolites activate ILC2s and trigger eosinophilia and type 2 inflammation to promote anti-parasite immunity.
In Aim 2, we will employ chemical and genetic approaches to test how the microbiota-intrinsic bile acid metabolic
pathway regulates dietary fiber-induced type 2 inflammation and immunity to infection. Upon successful
completion of our proposed aims, we expect to contribute to a fundamentally new understanding of the biology
of fiber diet, microbiota-derived metabolites, and ILC2s in regulating type 2 inflammation and anti-helminth
immunity."

Over 20 studies have shown that prolonged Exposure (PE) is a highly efficacious and effective treatment for
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While PE has been disseminated across many types of treatment
settings, it is still rarely available to substance using populations. This is unfortunate because co-occurrence of
PTSD and substance use disorder (SUD) is extremely common, research points to the importance of treating
both disorders concurrently with effective treatments, and numerous studies have shown PE to be safe and
effective for PTSD comorbid with SUD. One reason for poor dissemination may be that when PE is available to
SUD patients, treatment dropout is high and effect sizes are smaller for PTSD/SUD studies than for primary
PTSD. Higher PE attendance is associated with greater benefit over other treatment. A possible way to
enhance effectiveness is to offer PE in a massed format (M-PE; i.e., multiple sessions per week instead of
once weekly). For PTSD, M-PE has been shown to be effective and reduce drop out compared to weekly PE.
Although most studies of PTSD/SUD treatment have been in outpatient settings, there is indication that M-PE
initiated in intensive outpatient (IOP) SUD treatment can improve attendance and outcomes. Taken together,
the research suggests that initiating PE in a massed format in IOP SUD treatment is an extremely promising
strategy to improve PTSD/SUD outcomes. A critical next step is a pragmatic Hybrid Type I randomized clinical
trial of M-PE initiated in IOP SUD treatment. We propose to compare M-PE with treatment as usual (TAU) to
SUD treatment as usual only (SUD care including a weekly trauma skills group) at the Gateway Community
Services, Inc., a nationally recognized leader in community SUD treatment. Participants will be 168 male and
female GCS patients with PTSD/SUD. Our central hypotheses are that M-PE will result in greater reductions in
PTSD symptoms and substance use as compared to TAU. Our primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of
M-PE to TAU in IOP SUD treatment in impacting PTSD symptoms and substance use. We hypothesize that M-
PE will show greater improvements in PTSD symptom severity at study treatment completion and 1-, 3-, and 6-
months follow-up and less substance use at study treatment completion, 1-, 3-, and 6-months follow-up. We
will also explore differences in treatment arms on patient-centered outcomes, including days of (non-primary)
substance use, depressive symptoms, functioning, quality of life, suicidal ideation, and participant satisfaction.
We will examine gender as a moderator and changes in trauma related cognitions, cravings, and their temporal
association as mediators of change in PTSD and substance use. Finally, we will conduct a mixed-method
process evaluation to understand patients’, providers’ and stakeholders’ experiences with M-PE, explore
barriers to integrating M-PE into IOP SUD treatment, and identify strategies for widespread implementation."
10936635,"Pain, fatigue, and distress are highly prevalent co-occurring symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. When
these symptoms interfere with patients’ daily lives, it can diminish their ability to live congruently with their
values—greatly reducing quality of life (QoL). An exclusively medical approach to managing pain, fatigue, and
distress can have intolerable side effects and limited responsiveness. There is a need for psychosocial symptom
management interventions designed specifically for patients living with advanced cancer. Emerging evidence
suggests patients may benefit from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a third-wave Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy (CBT) approach that emphasizes acceptance, mindfulness, and engagement in values-
guided activity. Though pilot results in patients with advanced cancer have been promising, ACT-based
interventions have rarely been tested in well-powered efficacy trials. Building on our team’s extensive prior work,
we developed a psychosocial intervention called ENGAGE. ENGAGE includes training in traditional CBT skills
(e.g., activity pacing) to decrease symptom severity, when possible, and ACT skills (e.g., mindfulness) to promote
acceptance of experiences that cannot be fully controlled (e.g., prognosis), with the goal of decreasing symptom
interference and improving QoL. Our two pilot trials of ENGAGE provide strong support for its feasibility,
acceptability, and promise for improving patient-reported outcomes. This proposal progresses our work to an
NIH Phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate ENGAGE's efficacy for reducing symptom
interference in patients receiving cancer care in medically underserved areas. Delivered through
videoconferencing, this brief (4 weekly, 45-minute sessions) intervention has been designed to be acceptable
for patients residing in medically underserved areas by including graphical displays of concepts, videos modeling
skills, and audio content summaries. In this RCT, we will randomize 190 patients with Stage IV cancer (breast,
prostate, lung, or colorectal) and moderate-to-severe symptom interference to ENGAGE or Supportive Care
control. Patient-reported outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Aim 1 is to determine
ENGAGE's efficacy for reducing symptom interference (primary outcome) at 2 months (primary endpoint). Aim
2 is to determine ENGAGE’s efficacy for improving secondary outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy for symptom
management, acceptance, mindfulness, values-based activity, symptom severity, and QoL) at 2 months. Aim 3
is to test the maintenance of ENGAGE’s effects on primary and secondary outcomes at 4 months. An exploratory
aim seeks insights for future implementation efforts using mixed-methods data collection from patients, oncology
providers, and clinic leaders. This trial will be one of the first to test the efficacy of an ACT-based intervention for
patients with advanced cancer who are receiving care in medically underserved areas. ENGAGE is readily
implementable and, if shown to be efficacious, our team is well positioned to move rapidly into implementation
work, with the long-term aim of reducing suffering in patients with life-threatening illnesses."

I am seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) in order to acquire the necessary
training, practical experience, and knowledge to become a leading independent investigator focused on
improving the value of rehabilitation after stroke through an understanding of person and system level
variability. This award will provide the necessary support to achieve my Career Development Aims related to 1)
health services research, 2) the application of machine learning approaches, 3) scientific communication, and
4) leadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a Mentoring Committee
comprised of: Dr. Amit Kumar (primary mentor), a health services researcher and expert in Medicare data; Dr.
Julio Facelli (co-mentor), a biomedical informatician and recognized expert in the application of machine
learning clustering approaches to healthcare data; Dr. Angela Presson (co-mentor), an epidemiologist with
expertise in predictive modeling wit machine learning approaches. I have also created an Advisory Committee
of individuals with expertise in stroke care, rehabilitation, and health services research.
Individuals with stroke experience multiple care transitions from acute hospitals to post-acute settings and
between post-acute settings. Post-acute rehabilitation (PAR) is essential to recovery after stroke, yet many
individuals receive inadequate and interrupted PAR, which contributes to poor continuity of care, inefficient
care, and poor outcomes. To improve PAR utilization, we must transformation our healthcare system to
improve the value of PAR after stroke. However, because past work has only focused on PAR utilization cross
sectionally, we lack the foundational understanding of longitudinal PAR utilization that is needed to reshape
post-acute stroke care. My Scientific Aims directly address this gap and are to: 1A) identify subgroups of
longitudinal PAR utilization patterns during the first year after stroke, 1B) characterize subgroups of PAR
utilization with patient-, facility-, and community-level factors, and 2) determine the predictive strength of PAR
utilization on one-year outcomes after stroke.
The proposed work is significant because it will provide the required understanding of PAR utilization after
stroke that is needed to improve the continuity of care and the value of rehabilitative care. The proposed work
is innovative because it focuses on longitudinal PAR and long-term outcomes, uses cutting edge approaches
to access and analyze Medicare data, and incorporates nationally representative data sources. The expected
outcome will 1) lay the groundwork for subsequent R01 submissions examining the impact of PAR utilization
on functional outcomes and validating models of PAR utilization and outcomes and 2) facilitate my transition to
independence."

 Sarcoidosis, characterized by non-caseating granulomas, is a multi-organ inflammatory disease
disproportionately affecting black patients in the United States. Although cardiac sarcoidosis occurs in 20-30%
of all patients with sarcoidosis, it contributes to 85% of deaths by causing heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias,
and sudden cardiac death. The lack of therapeutic targets for cardiac sarcoidosis remains a significant gap in
clinical care. My prior work has focused on utilizing single-cell multi-omics and mass cytometry (CyTOF) to
identify pathogenic antigen-specific T-cell subsets in myocarditis due to cancer immunotherapy. Now, I am
excited to pivot my research direction and extend these innovative methods to investigate cardiac sarcoidosis,
with the goal of bringing my prior experience with deep immunophenotyping tools to help bridge the translational
gap in cardiac inflammatory diseases. Dysregulation in CD4 T-helper cell (Th) subsets, particularly Th17.1
expressing C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 3 (CXCR3), has been associated with a number of inflammatory
diseases, including sarcoidosis. I hypothesize that cardiac sarcoidosis is associated with recruitment of CXCR3+
Th17.1 cells to the heart, which can be therapeutically targeted with CXCR3 blockade. To test this, I will utilize
a mouse model of cardiac sarcoidosis and biobank samples from patients with cardiac and non-cardiac
pulmonary-only sarcoidosis compared to healthy controls. In Aim 1, I will perform single-cell RNA-seq, TCR-seq,
and CITE-seq on tissue (heart, blood, lymphoid organs, lungs) isolated from Tsc2fl/fl CD11c Cre+ mice with
cardiac sarcoidosis. In Aim 2, I will conduct single-cell multi-omics and deep T-cell phenotyping on specimens
biobanked from patients with cardiac sarcoidosis compared to pulmonary-only sarcoidosis and healthy control
patients. In Aim 3, I will explore the therapeutic effects of CXCR3+ blockade on T-cell migration. Specifically,
Aim 3a, I will investigate the mechanistic effects of blocking CXCR3 and its ligands, CXCL9/10, on macrophage-
mediated Th17.1 cell migration and function in an in vitro transwell system, while in Aim 3b I will treat Tsc2fl/fl
CD11c Cre+ mice with CXCR3 blockade to assess for reduced cardiac granuloma formation and Th17.1 cell
migration to the heart assessed by single-cell multi-omics. By completing this project, I will define key pathogenic
T-cell subsets and interactions between adaptive and innate immunity that drive cardiac sarcoidosis, and test a
potential therapeutic pathway for precision medicine. In doing so, I hope to pave the way for the development of
adjuvant therapies for treatment and prevention of cardiac sarcoidosis. This Katz R01 will be instrumental in
launching my change in research direction within cardio-immunology."

Chronic ocular surface pain (COSP) affects approximately 5-15% of the US population at some time in their lives
at an estimated cost of over $55 billion annually. People with COSP experience painful eye burning, irritation,
and aching, leading to functional impairment and decreased quality of life. Conventional treatments directed at
the ocular surface – the perceived pain source – are inadequate for pain relief in over 50% of patients. We
hypothesize that some individuals with COSP also suffer symptoms driven by central nervous system (CNS)
dysfunction, similar to chronic overlapping pain conditions, rather than solely pathological problems in the eye.
These chronic overlapping pain conditions (e.g., fibromyalgia or interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome) show
clear nociplastic mechanisms, where the pain results from amplified and/or dysregulated CNS signaling and
sensory processing. Our premise is supported by nociplastic pain features observed in COSP. These include:
(a) pain with minimal ocular surface signs (sign/symptom discordance), (b) multisite pain and CNS-mediated
somatic symptoms (fatigue), (d) augmented CNS pain processing on evoked sensory testing and neuroimaging,
and (e) persistent pain after topical anesthetic. To date, no comprehensive study has investigated the clinical,
neurobiological, and treatment response features of nociplastic pain in a cohort of COSP sufferers. We will
rigorously define the role of nociplastic pain in COSP with a large, representative cohort of patients (N=200)
using established clinical phenotypic, neurobiological, and treatment response features. We propose that as
sign/symptom discordance increases so will features indicative of nociplastic pain. In Aim 1, we will clinically
phenotype COSP participants using validated patient-reported outcome measures and ocular exams. In Aim 2,
we will compare the neurobiological features of nociplastic pain across the discordance spectrum among a
subset of Aim 1 participants. For this intensive examination subset, we will use multimodal evoked sensory
testing and structural/functional brain MRI to assess regions important for pain perception and modulation.
Similarly, we hypothesize that patients with high pain discordance will exhibit amplified multisensory perception
and increased pro-nociceptive functional connectivity. In Aim 3, we will examine and validate predictors of
COSP pain responses before and after application of a topical anesthetic to the ocular surface. The use of
topical anesthetic should block peripherally induced discomfort to allow for clarification of pain origination. We
hypothesize that patients with heightened nociplastic pain features will have reduced anesthetic response.
Findings from the study have the potential to fundamentally change the way ocular pain syndromes are
conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. The work is likely to identify new integrative CNS-directed pain
treatments for patients with COSP and will provide fundamental insights into the ineffectiveness of peripherally
directed therapies."

Viruses and the organisms they infect impose strong reciprocal selective pressure on each other. This is
particularly pronounced at protein-protein interfaces between viruses and their hosts, such as in the case of
antiviral proteins and the virus-encoded proteins that they target. Studying the biology of infection therefore
provides insight into infectious disease as well as into the underlying mechanisms of protein evolution. Host-
virus interactions have been extensively studied in mammals and to a lesser extent other vertebrates, yet
protein-based immunity has been studied less in other metazoans. Studying protein-based immunity in
divergent species will provide an important comparative point to better understand how antiviral proteins
evolve. It additionally presents an opportunity to characterize unique ways by which other species combat
viral infection, with potential implications for our own struggles with viral diseases. This Pathway to
Independence proposal will support the development of a research program focused on the use of structural
homology as a means of uncovering and studying independently evolved effector proteins, both in
understudied, biodiverse species and in the viruses that infect them. Throughout the proposal, structural
modeling is used to close the gap in our understanding of the structural and functional diversity present in
the proteomes of model organisms and viruses and those that have been less studied. In Aim 1, I will perform
extensive structural homology searches for viruses and diverse animals. The goals of these searches will
be to 1) define patterns of gene capture in diverse viruses, with focus on unique domain organizations, and
2) define structural homologs of antiviral proteins in diverse metazoans. Aim 2 investigates the apparent
independent evolution of an antiviral zinc finger-containing protein in mollusks and vertebrates. This aim will
provide insight into how domains adapt to serve unique functions. It integrates virological and biochemical
approaches to understand the relationship between RNA binding properties and antiviral potential of proteins
that include this domain. Aim 3 involves the use of yeast as a heterologous system to study the functional
plasticity of antiviral EIF2a kinases and virus-encoded proteins that inhibit them. This aim will provide insight
into the rules of pathogen sensing by kinases and expand the study of translational shutoff during viral
infection beyond vertebrates and model organisms. Aims 2 and 3 of this proposal will establish a foundation
for the future study of other independently evolved effector proteins, such as those found in the searches
proposed in Aim 1. This proposal will provide me with extensive training to attain my career goals. I already
have robust experience in molecular biology and virology techniques, as well as a developing skillset in
computational biology. By completing the Aims of this proposal, I will learn new techniques in computational
biology, biochemistry, and yeast genetics from my outstanding mentor and advisory committee that will
supplement my skillset and diversify the research paradigms in my future independent career."

This U01 grant application is submitted in response to RFA EY-21-002 “Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD) Integrative Biology Initiative”, with the goal of determining if patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC)-retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) can be used to discover the underlying pathophysiology of AMD.
Studies from our laboratory as well as those of others strongly support the use of iPSC-RPE to understand how
specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with high risk for advanced AMD influences multiple
biological processes in the RPE. Our studies will focus on two SNPs with the highest odds ratio for developing
advanced AMD- Age-Related Maculopathy Susceptibility 2/High Temperature Requirement A1 (ARMS2/HTRA1)
and Complement Factor H (CFH). We will use the iPSC developed by the NEI and the New York Stem Cell
Foundation (NYSCF) and differentiate the parent cells and their reciprocal isogenic lines into RPE using the
protocol established in the Bharti laboratory. The parent/isogenic lines provide an excellent model system for
deciphering the molecular factors that determine how the presence of SNPs in one or both genes affect the
response to stress. We will test the hypothesis that the presence of homozygous risk alleles for either
ARMS2/HTRA1 or CFH, independent and in combination, have a negative impact on the RPE stress response.
Furthermore, each genetic risk profile will have a unique stress response. Our proposed studies will integrate
classical reductionist investigations, coupled with discovery-driven analyses, to test specific hypotheses. Aim 1
will focus on differentiating and characterizing iPSC-RPE cell lines from 10 AMD patients and their isogenic lines.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the presence of AMD high-risk SNPs alter the cellular response to stress by
performing large-scale quantification of proteins and metabolites, coupled with mt functional assays. Parent cells
and their isogenic lines will be compared to determine the impact on metabolism and the stress response in
iPSC-RPE (i) with the CFH high-risk SNP and (ii) for high risk ARMS2/HTRA1, alone or in combination with high
risk CFH. These studies will address how the presence of specific risk variants affect RPE exposed to a
physiologically relevant stress, an important gap in knowledge of AMD pathogenesis. Knowledge about the
molecular details has the potential to lead to development of therapies targeting the primary defect in a
genetically defined population of AMD patients, which in turn, could lead to a “personalized medicine” approach
for treatment of AMD."
10925183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The processing of antigens through proteolytic degradation and the recognition of epitopes is central to the
body’s ability to combat pathogens, like viruses, through discriminating self from non-self. As a result, there
has been substantial research effort aimed at determining the outcomes of these processes for novel
pathogens to enable epitope-driven vaccine design. There has also been great interest at the intersection of
immunology and personalized medicine in identifying subject (host) specific epitopes, as these have great
promise in the treatment of allergies and cancer where the distinction between self vs. non-self becomes
blurred. Computational methods have emerged as promising approaches for identifying (predicting) epitopes
that elicit a robust immune response given genetic information for an antigen. This is a very challenging task,
which is compounded further due to the existence of uncertainty caused by genetic variability between
pathogen strains, as well as, from individual to individual. Following this logic, it is also clear that using animal
models in evaluating the immune response elicited by epitopes can often have limited predictive value, since
sequence differences between a model species and humans can result in significantly different outcomes in
terms of the peptides formed during antigen processing and epitopes recognized by immune cell receptors.
Accordingly, there is an unmet need for computational tools that can predict the outcomes of antigen
processing and epitope recognition in a host-dependent fashion, where the models take as input both antigen
and host-specific genetic data. We propose the development of computational tools in three related areas to
meet these needs: i) Prediction of peptides formed through antigen processing; ii) Prediction of epitope
recognition by MHC molecules and T-cell receptors; and iii) Probabilistic analysis of epitopes most likely to
elicit an immune response. In the proposed work, molecular modeling and machine learning will be used to
develop accurate models of antigen processing and epitope binding to MHC molecules and T-cell receptors.
Molecular models will first allow us to identify key interactions between the antigen and immune system
proteins, which when coupled with statistical data can allow us to understand how mutations would affect those
interactions. The statistical analysis of the effects of mutations will be applied to large publicly available
datasets to sufficiently capture the effects of mutations on antigen processing and epitope recognition and will
ultimately be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed probabilistic models will apply a
scenario-driven approach for capturing uncertainty in epitope generation and recognition. We will sample
potential antigen and human sequences based on known distributions of mutation prevalence to measure the
likelihood that an identified epitope will be generated and elicit a robust immune response. The proposed
computational tools, if successful, could have substantial impact on the areas of epitope-driven vaccine design,
including personalized cancer vaccines, and the identification of allergy related epitopes."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major public health crisis in the United States, with >50,000 overdose deaths in
2017 alone. Addiction to opioids is intimately related to the physiology of the brain’s dopamine-based
rewarding system. The neurotensin 1 receptor (NTR1) is found among dopamine pre and post-synaptic
neurons in the central nervous system, and acts as a modulator of dopaminergic systems. Even though
substantial evidence points towards NTR1 as a molecular target for treating addiction disorders, few non-
peptide brain penetrant neurotensin modulators have been identified, and orthosteric NTR1 ligands display
side effects including hypotension and hypothermia that have limited their clinical development. Recently, we
have discovered a series of brain-penetrant NTR1 modulators, including a lead compound SBI-553, with a
unique mechanism of action at NTR1. SBI-553 is an orally available and brain penetrant b-arrestin biased
allosteric modulator of NTR1, which shows efficacy in a range of addiction models. The literature contains no
documented reports of such molecules among positive or negative allosteric modulators of GPCRs. In addition,
the unique profile of SBI-553 appears to circumvent the clinically limiting side effects of hypothermia and
hypotension displayed by orthosteric NTR1 ligands. While potentially high risk, the activity of SBI-553 has been
validated in vitro and in vivo, and the initial safety profiling indicates no issues that would preclude further
development. The goal of the application is to develop SBI-553 as a treatment for opioid use disorders.
A 2-year UG3 phase is proposed with the primary objective of determining the suitability of SBI-553 (or a
backup compound) entering IND-enabling studies followed by a 2-year UH3 phase with the primary objective
of completing a Phase 1 single ascending dose study.
During the UG3 phase, the team will complete pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and the preclinical safety profile of
SBI-553 in a relevant species; identify a backup compound to SBI-553; and conduct definitive cellular and in
vivo pharmacology studies with SBI-553 (and/or potential backup) in models of addiction to inform best clinical
indication and clinical endpoints (PK/pharmacodynamic). During the UH3 Phase, the team will ensure
completion of GMP Synthesis, Stability Testing and Formulation; GLP Toxicology studies; and the Phase 1
single ascending dose study."
10921956,"Abstract
Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder in which the host’s T cells attack the insulin-producing β-cells
in the pancreatic islet of Langerhans. The onset of symptomatic disease is preceded by two asymptomatic
stages in which islet autoantibodies develop and glucose metabolism becomes disturbed. If the unwanted
immune response is dampened during this critical asymptomatic period clinical T1D can be delayed by several
years and, in some cases, prevented altogether. Currently, teplizumab is the sole therapeutic available for
treating pre-clinical T1D and only a fraction of patients respond to it. This necessitates the development of
novel alternative treatments. Unfortunately, this endeavor is hampered by a paucity of biomarkers that can
accurately report a patient’s response to treatments that are designed to stop T1D from progressing.
Advancing the development of novel therapies for T1D starts by identifying biomarkers that can accurately
inform and predict the progression of pre-clinical disease.
In this Fast Track, Metabolon will address the need for better predictive biomarkers by testing the hypothesis
that using metabolomics data in conjunction with traditional risk factors of disease progression can
predict the advancement of pre-clinical T1D more accurately than traditional risk factors alone.
Metabolites are the small molecule intermediates and products of metabolism upon which inputs from the
genome, environment, and lifestyle factors converge. Given their unique position in the central dogma of
biology they are considered to be the closest reflection of an individual’s real-time health status. Metabolites
reflect disease activity through changes in their abundance, which can be quantified using ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). When used in an
untargeted manner, UHPLC-MS/MS can measure a wide collection of metabolites in a given biological sample,
enabling the identification of disease-causing metabolic perturbations (i.e., metabolic signatures of disease).
We and others have shown that metabolic signatures associated with T1D can provide deep phenotypic insight
into the activity that both precedes and aligns with T1D progression. In collaboration with Dr. Marian Rewers at
the University of Colorado School of Medicine, Metabolon will leverage its proprietary UHPLC-MS/MS platform,
NGPTM, to interrogate metabolic signatures unique to stage 1 and stage 2 of T1D and utilize high level
statistical analyses to determine whether metabolomics data, used with or without traditional risk factors, can
predict the progression of T1D more accurately than traditional risk factors alone.
The ultimate outcome of a successful Fast Track will be the development of a tool that targets these metabolic
biomarkers. Predicting the likelihood that a patient will progress to clinical disease with higher accuracy
represents a step towards improving our ability to assess a patient’s response to novel T1D therapies to
thereby improve patient outcomes."

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis and an important cause of kidney failure.
It is a mesangioproliferative glomerular disease defined by characteristic IgA1 mesangial deposits. These
mesangial deposits likely originate from circulating immune complexes that contain IgA1 with Galactose (Gal)-
deficient O-glycans (Gd-IgA1, the autoantigen) that are bound by IgG autoantibodies. The pathogenesis model
describing IgAN as an autoimmune disease was based on the discovery of IgG autoantibodies that bind Gd-
IgA1 in the laboratory of Dr. Jan Novak at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). As part of these
studies, Dr. Novak’s laboratory developed assays for the detection and quantitative assessment of both Gd-IgA1
and IgG autoantibodies. The use of these assays for analysis of serum samples from several cohorts of IgAN
patients has been published; both the Gd-IgA1 assay and the IgG autoantibody assay have potential as markers
for preclinical detection of IgAN, prediction of outcome, and monitoring the response to therapy. The established
pathogenesis model of IgAN enabled pharmaceutical industry to start developing and testing treatment for the
disease. However, only secondary markers (e.g., proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) are
currently used as the endpoints, adding to the time and cost of clinical trials. Thus, clinical-grade tests that assess
primary causative markers are urgently needed. We have previously developed an IgAN-specific biomarker
assay for the IgG autoantibody. However, to date, there still does not exist a clinical-grade test for the robust
measurement of Gd-IgA1 (the autoantigen) despite it being considered a key biomarker for the disease. To
address this requisite, Reliant Glycosciences has developed a clinical-grade version of a N-acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc)-specific lectin-based Gd-IgA1 assay that detects terminal GalNAc (i.e., Galactose-deficient) O-glycans
on IgA1 in serum. This assay is based on the original Novak assay that was part of foundational studies in IgAN
that defined the pathogenesis of the disease. We have a fully developed proof of concept assay kit that has
shown promising performance in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility in both internal and external studies with
a set of performance quality control samples. Thus, this proposal is being submitted as a straight-to Phase II
application. The goal of this proposal is to expand our validation studies, begin prototype production, and start
the regulatory approval process for this Gd-IgA1 assay kit (called the GalD Assay). We will also establish the
assay in a CLIA setting so that it can be validated and commercialized for clinical use."
10922106,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging plays a pivotal role in radiopharmaceutical
therapy (RPT), allowing clinicians to personalize prescriptions and assess treatment response. However,
traditional SPECT reconstruction methods often encounter challenges related to noise, artifacts, and lengthy
processing times. In imaging, accurate correction of scattering effects and enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) are critical for achieving quantitively accurate images required for dosimetry guidance of RPT and
treatment response assessment. Torch Recon is a cutting-edge software that harnesses the synergistic power
of Monte Carlo simulation and deep learning techniques to address the limitations of conventional reconstruction
methods. Monte Carlo simulation accurately models photon interactions within tissues, leading to improved
accuracy and resolution in the reconstructed images. Complementing this, deep learning algorithms are
employed to enhance image quality, reduce noise, and suppress artifacts. These algorithms leverage large
datasets to learn intricate patterns and relationships, resulting in sharper, more informative SPECT images.
Torch Recon represents the fusion of Monte Carlo simulation and deep learning, enabling a dynamic and
adaptive reconstruction process which has the potential to not only improve quantitative SPECT but also SNR
which is especially important for scenarios with low counting statistics, e.g., alpha emitters. As part of a previous
Phase I contract, we incorporated a SPECT reconstruction algorithm with a GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo-based
scatter estimator into the GPU-based Torch software system for RPT dosimetry. In this Phase II proposal, we
will (1) implement AI denoising techniques into Torch Recon, (2) assess accuracy and performance of the
reconstruction software using phantoms, and (3) validate clinical usability and effectiveness through a
prospective clinical trial. By completing the milestones of this Phase II proposal, Torch Recon will be ready for
510(k) clearance and commercialization."
10923285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ankle and hindfoot are made up of complex interlocking bones and joints that work together to enable
movement of the foot. Unfortunately, these bones and joints can become severely damaged as a result of
disease or injury, leading to devastating pain and disability. Patients facing severe ankle-hindfoot damage have
limited treatment options: they can either amputate the leg below the knee, or pursue a salvage operation called
ankle-hindfoot arthrodesis (“fusion”), which involves using orthopaedic nails and screws to connect the bones in
the foot so that the joints no longer move. Unfortunately, about 30% of ankle-hindfoot fusions fail, requiring the
limb to be amputated anyway. Even for the estimated 70% of ankle-hindfoot fusions that are “successful”, the
functional outcomes are so severely restrictive that patients may eventually choose to have an amputation,
because a prosthetic leg would provide more function than their fused joints. In short, current treatment options
are so limited that patients and clinicians often choose to amputate the injured leg, even when the muscles, skin,
and other bones of the foot are still viable.
In this work, we aim to fundamentally reinvent the care paradigm for traumatic injury or disease of the ankle and
hindfoot by advancing a novel Compliant Ankle Endoprosthesis with the potential to restore function and alleviate
pain, without requiring fusion or amputation. By preventing limb loss and eliminating the need for ankle-hindfoot
fusion, our goal is to alleviate suffering and restore much more functional capacity than is currently possible.
Our product restores joint motion via deformation of flexible elements, rather than rubbing or sliding of bearing
surfaces. The device originated in one of the applicants’ engineering lab at UCLA. Feasibility of this product has
already been demonstrated in the applicant’s lab in simulation, on the benchtop, and in a large animal model. In
this work, we will conduct the late-stage pre-clinical studies required for regulatory approval of this device, prior
to clinical testing. Specifically, we intend to show that i) acute failure of the implant happens only under super-
physiologic loads and in a way that does not endanger the surrounding tissues, and ii) the implant has the
durability necessary to support human gait for decades inside the body. We will conduct this research over 12
months, and the data we obtain will be used in an FDA Investigational Device Exemption application to support
an early feasibility study, and in the NIH SBIR Phase II application. Major milestones to be achieved with this
grant include direct experimental validation of short- and long-term mechanical survivability of the Compliant
Ankle Endoprosthesis, in preparation for clinical testing."

10931086,"My laboratory is interested in the (patho-)physiological importance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD), a principal ER quality-control machinery to clear misfolded ER proteins for cytosolic proteasomal degradation. The Sel1L-Hrd1 protein complex represents the most evolutionarily conserved ERAD machinery from yeast to humans. In the past several years, we and others have reported the physiological significance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in health and disease in a cell-type and substrate-specific manner; however, our understanding of its physiological role remains limited. In the preliminary data of this application, we performed an unbiased proteomics screen that led to the identification of ceruloplasmin (Cp) protein, a ferroxidase regulating iron homeostasis, as an ERAD substrate in the liver. We further showed that both wildtype and a disease mutant Cp are misfolding-prone and are ubiquitinated and degraded by Sel1L- Hrd1 ERAD. Moreover, hepatocyte-specific Sel1L-deficient mice exhibit elevated Cp activity in the circulation and are resistant to iron deficiency-induced hypochromic microcytic anemia. These data point to a critical role of hepatocyte Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in Cp biogenesis and systemic iron homeostasis. These findings are exciting because Cp is an essential regulator in iron homeostasis and because Cp missense mutations in humans cause a clinical condition known as aceruloplasminemia, characterized by abnormal iron accumulation in organs. However, the biogenesis of nascent Cp in the ER remains unexplored. Hence, the overarching hypothesis of this application is that Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in hepatocytes controls systemic iron homeostasis by regulating the turnover of both wildtype and disease mutant Cp proteins under physiological and pathological conditions, respectively. We will accomplish the following three Aims: (1) Determine the physiological and pathological significance of Sel1L-Hrd1 ERAD in iron metabolism; (2) Delineate the molecular mechanism underlying Cp biogenesis regulated by ERAD; and (3) Delineate the pathological importance of ERAD in the pathogenesis of aceruloplasminemia. Completion of these studies will not only delineate the significance and molecular mechanism underlying ERAD-mediated regulation of iron metabolism, but also provide novel insights into how iron metabolism is regulated under basal and pathological conditions. Relevance to human health: Disorders of iron homeostasis affect millions of individuals worldwide, which cause anemia in deficiency and increase the risk of diabetes, liver and kidney diseases upon overload. This application, with parallel physiological and biochemical studies, will establish a direct link between ERAD and iron metabolism, uncover novel mechanisms underlying ERAD and misfolding-associated proteotoxic stress, and advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis associated with protein folding defects in general."
10910386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable clinical responses in
patients with B cell malignancies. However, approximately 50% of treated patients do not exhibit durable
responses and CAR T cells for solid tumors have been largely ineffective. Poor T cell fitness, whereby T cells
lose the ability to expand, persist, and mediate antitumor responses, is a major barrier to progress for the
development improved CAR T cell therapies. Emerging research suggests poor fitness is associated with
epigenetic changes that lock T cells into a dysfunctional state, and further, that epigenetic reprogramming is
mechanistically important for overcoming poor fitness. This presents a unique challenge since existing
epigenome engineering approaches 1) are associated with technical hurdles that limit feasibility and
translatability, and 2) are either non-specific (e.g., epigenetic drugs that induce global chromatin remodeling) or
exceedingly specific (e.g., dCas9-based methods that target 1 or a few genes) and are therefore suboptimal for
inducing the extensive but pathway-specific epigenetic changes associated with changes in fitness. The goal of
this proposal is to develop and optimize a new class of epigenetic reprogramming factors (ERFs) which can
target hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of DNA regions in a pathway-specific manner. The ERF
platform is modular and fully programmable, thereby enabling fine-tuning of the specificity, strength, and
durability of epigenetic marks. We will leverage this technology to target T cell exhaustion and aging-associated
dysfunction, which are characterized by stable epigenetic marks that limit T cell responsiveness. ERFs will be
designed to prevent or reverse epigenetic signatures that manifest during exhaustion and aging, thereby
augmenting CAR T cell fitness and antitumor function. The proposed work will advance the state-of-the-art in T
cell reprogramming and provide a powerful approach to enhance CAR T cell potency for liquid and solid tumors.
In addition to their translational potential, ERFs can also function as molecular tools to interrogate transcription
factor biology, gene expression programs, and epigenetics, and therefore have important implications for basic
human T cell biology. Ultimately, we envision an ERF toolkit whereby combinations of ERFs can be tailored to
enhance T cell fitness in a patient- or disease-specific manner. Since chromatin remodeling underpins cellular
reprogramming in other cell types and disease settings, we predict that ERFs will be broadly applicable to other
therapeutic modalities and represent a paradigm shift in the growing field of epigenome engineering."

This project aims to better understand the regulation and function of RNA editing in cancer
through analysis of existing omics data sets. RNA editing is a prevalent type of RNA
modification where the RNA sequences are altered through insertion, deletion or substitution of
nucleotides. In mammals, the most common type of RNA editing is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I)
editing. Catalyzed by the ADAR enzymes, A-to-I editing is the most prevalent type of RNA
editing in human, occurring in the majority of human transcripts. In the past few decades, great
progress was made to understand the critical function of a small number of A-to-I editing sites in
cancer-related genes, most of which alter protein-coding sequences. Owing to the recent
advances in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies and bioinformatic methodologies, an
unprecedented number of A-to-I editing sites have been cataloged for various organisms.
Importantly, widespread aberrant RNA editing has been reported in a number of cancer types.
In addition, increasing evidence supports that ADAR and RNA editing levels are associated with
patient survival or response to therapy. However, many questions remain, the most significant
ones including the unclear mechanisms through which ADAR and RNA editing contribute to
cancer-related pathways and the unknown regulatory mechanisms underlying aberrant RNA
editing in cancer. In this project, we propose to extend our recent successes at developing and
applying bioinformatic approaches in RNA editing studies to address the above challenges. We
will capitalize on the large collection of RNA-seq data sets derived from different types of cancer
samples. We will develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets,
complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations, to predict and
validate the molecular function of RNA editing and related regulatory mechanisms. This work
will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of the molecular basis of RNA editing
and provide new insights to the involvement of RNA editing in human cancer."

Age is the dominant risk factor for most chronic diseases; yet mechanisms by which aging confers
risk are largely unknown. One unifying feature of aging diseases as diverse as cardiovascular
disease and cancer is the acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells (frequently
DNMT3A, TET2, JAK2), termed Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP). I will
leverage human genomics to identify pathways underlying CHIP acquisition, clonal expansion
and disease. Why only some individuals develop CHIP, why only some CHIP clones expand, and
why only a minority of CHIP carriers develop disease is presently unknown. I hypothesize that
germline genetic variation contributes to CHIP acquisition, clonal expansion and disease. I
propose to (1) identify CHIP in existing genome sequencing data and perform genetic association
analyses of CHIP in >800,000 individuals and evaluate how CHIP-associated variants alter
human hematopoietic stem cell function in in-vitro follow-up experiments. (2) Define the
determinants of CHIP clonal expansion and association with disease. (3) Identify gene expression
programs that cause clonal expansion and disease. Successful execution of these aims will
highlight therapeutic targets for the prevention of CHIP, clonal expansion and disease for which
no therapies currently exist. Such a CHIP therapeutic would potentially be an intervention for
multiple aging diseases. To succeed in these aims, I will receive significant institutional support
from MGH including funding, space, protected time and mentorship to establish my research
group. The Broad Institute will provide access to leading-edge genomic resources. I will leverage
my unique position at the interface of these two scientific communities to establish a leading
research program focused on CHIP. Having completed rigorous training in genomics,
cardiovascular biology, and clinical medicine, I am now poised to leverage these skills, resources
and mentorship to embark on my own independent research career without delay."
10911687,"Project Description:
Botulinum toxin (Botox) has been proven clinically effective in treating symptoms for conditions including vocal
muscle spasticity, strabismus, hyperactive urinary bladder, excessive sweating, and chronic migraine as well as
for numerous cosmetic applications. The measurement of potency for commercially available Botox is primarily
through a mouse lethality bioassay (MLB). There are over 1 million animals sacrificed each year to establish the
potency of clinical dosages of Botox. There are currently few established analytical or in vitro potency testing
available and no pharmacodynamic (PD) or traditional pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have been performed on
commercially marketed Botox. Hickman from UCF published the first dose response curve for BOTOX® in 2018
utilizing their patented neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model and this has been licensed and commercialized by
Hesperos for preclinical disease modeling and toxicity applications. However, it has not been qualified by the
FDA yet. Hesperos is a company founded by Hickman and Dr. Michael Shuler, who is considered the founder of
the body-on-a-chip field. This proposal seeks to submit validation data to the FDA for qualification to establish a
potency assay for Botox and to ensure the capacity to test a significant number of commercial lots on a weekly
basis. The Hickman paper described the construction of a functional neuromuscular junction (NMJ) system
utilizing human cells that enabled the establishment of dose response curves for BOTOX® from Allergan, as well
as curare and bungarotoxin. The system is composed of two chambers that are electrically and fluidically isolated
and connected by small tunnels through which the axons grow and innervate the skeletal muscle and each
chamber can be separately stimulated and dosed (US Patents 8,835,168B2, 9,267,936B2 and 10,935,541). The
first Aim will establish the high throughput NMJ system that will enable 80-100 Botox samples to be evaluated
per week. However, once developed it will be straightforward to build additional systems to scale the testing
capability to over 400 per week, if demand increases. The second Aim will validate the NMJ system with 10
different commercial Botox samples tested using the mouse lethality bioassay (MLB) for dose response to satisfy
the in vivo comparison, and separately for the additional functional parameters. This data will be submitted to
the FDA and then the system will be qualified first with blinded commercial samples from the FDA Toxicological
Branch and then for in person evaluation by FDA staff in similar fashion to qualification of other facilities. This
process, which has been developed in consultation with Drs. Sharma and Fitzpatrick at the FDA and Dr. Tagle
from NCATS, will establish a route by which microphysiological systems available through CROs can be
validated and qualified for all providers, which is confirmed in an email to support this as the test case. This is a
crucial step for commercialization of these MPS models as over half of all preclinical research for pharmaceutical
companies is performed by CROs and a regulatory pathway for MPS in CROs is not currently established."

With the support of Phases I and II of COBRE “Mentoring Translational Research in Louisiana”, the LSU School
of Medicine and the Louisiana Cancer Research Center (LCRC), the TGC has developed into a state-of-the-art
institutional facility capable of implementing a variety of next generation sequencing (NGS) protocols including
whole transcriptome, RNASeq, whole exome sequencing, and array-based methylation and SNP analysis,
single-cell sequencing and chromatin-immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The TGC has served
multiple projects through the establishment of service contracts and collaborations at the institutional, local and
international level. The TGC is now ideally positioned to support the Phase 2 COBRE “Center for Translational
Viral Oncology” (CTVO) application. As in the first phase of the CTVO, the Junior Principal Investigators (JPIs)
of the proposed projects will have a discounted pricing structure, comprehensive training, instrumentation
access, troubleshooting protocols, and data analysis assistance that is linked to multi-institutional informatics
pipelines, including the CTVO BBC. The TGC has been instrumental in the acquisition of two P20-SPORE grants:
1) P20CA202922 (PIs Miele and Meade), and a collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL, in which
the TGC Director is a research project PI; 2) 5P20CA233374 (PIs Ochoa, Miele). These studies aim to determine
correlations between gene markers and obesity/ethnicity in triple negative breast cancer African American and

 Protein synthesis is a fundamental process in all living cells and is highly regulated to accommodate the
specific needs of each cell. Dysregulated protein synthesis has been demonstrated to underlie many of
syndromic forms of autism such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), both of
which result from defects in genes that regulate protein synthesis. Moreover, mouse models of FXS and TSC
exhibit defective synaptic function, and ASD-like behaviors. Recent studies have shown that Eukaryotic
Elongation Factor 1A2 (EEF1A2), a protein responsible for GTP-dependent transport of aminoacyl-tRNAs to the
elongating ribosome, is mutated in patients with autism, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Elongation Factor 1A
has two isoforms, one that is ubiquitously expressed, EEF1A1, and another, EEF1A2 that is expressed only in
neurons and myocytes. It is unclear why another isoform is needed in these specific cells; however, it has been
found that EEF1A2 is critical for neuronal survival. The wasted mouse, a mouse model with a homozygous
deletion of mouse Eef1a2, has been found to exhibit neuron degeneration, tremors, loss of muscle bulk and gait
abnormalities after weaning. EEF1A2 has been also shown to bundle actin and microtubules independently of
translation, a process known to be critical for neuronal development and migration. This evidence suggests a
critical role played by EEF1A2 in neuronal development and function.
 This proposal aims to uncover how ASD-associated mutations in EEF1A2 results in deficits in neuronal
development and autism pathophysiology. Using human iPSC (induced pluripotent stems cells) derived neurons
as a model, the CRISPR-Cas9 system will be used to recapitulate patient mutations. These iPSCs will then be
differentiated into neurons using neurogenin-2, a master transcription factor capable of inducing differentiation
into excitatory neurons in under 2 weeks. Using this platform, the effect of ASD-associated mutations on neuronal
function will be studied. The first aim examines the effect of ASD-associated EEF1A2 mutations on protein
synthesis in neurons, given the central role that EEF1A2 plays in protein synthesis. Furthermore, the changes
to the translatome profile, elongation rate and translational efficiency in these cells will be identified. The second
aim will explore changes to neuronal morphology. function and development. After differentiation, induced
neurons with ASD-associated EEF1A2 mutations will be examined for altered morphology using
immunocytochemical analysis. During differentiation, live cell imaging will be used to track neurite growth and
the aberrant signaling pathways involved in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal regulation will be studied. Finally,
electrophysiology will used to assess synapse function and strength by measuring excitatory post synaptic
currents. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the role translation control plays in neuronal
development, and how its dysregulation leads to ASD pathophysiology."

10935521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 1 - Care Integration for Patients with Cancer Treated in
Health Systems
This Project focuses on care integration for patients with cancer who are treated in vertically integrated health
systems (i.e., organizations that own and operate hospitals and medical practices). Health systems are
growing in the U.S., and understanding the conditions under which they effectively manage complex oncology
care, which spans settings, sites and disciplines, is vital. Within a sample of practice sites owned by health
systems, we will measure variation in non-structural forms of integration including: functional integration (e.g.,
having policies and protocols for coordination of care across settings), interpersonal integration (e.g.,
collaboration and teamwork within and across organizations), normative integration (e.g., common culture),
and clinical process integration (e.g., activities intended to integrate care) and determine how they relate to
care quality, utilization, and spending, overall and for historically marginalized populations. We also will
evaluate how structural features (e.g. co-location, referral patterns, geographic reach) of system-owned
practice sites relate to these non-structural forms of integration. Working with Projects 2, 3 and 4 and the
Cores, the team will conduct case studies and interviews within health systems and their hospitals and
practices. We will then collect representative data on integration measures with surveys from system leaders,
practice managers, oncologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, palliative care specialists, other clinicians, and
practice staff. The team will use administrative data from Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers to
describe key outcomes of cancer care, including quality of care, utilization, and spending, and assess the
association of various forms of integration with these outcomes overall and for historically marginalized
populations. The aims include:
Aim 1. Adapt an existing conceptual framework to describe and develop measures of key forms of integration
in health systems (i.e., structural, functional, normative, interpersonal, process) for oncology care delivered in
health systems, using case studies and interviews. We will identify mechanisms through which distinct forms of
integration may improve quality, utilization, and equity among patients served by health systems.
Aim 2: Measure and assess care integration in health systems via surveys of practice leaders, clinicians, and
staff. Assess how practice site, system (e.g., size, geographic reach) and market characteristics relate to non-
structural forms of integration (functional, normative, interpersonal and process).
Aim 3. After linking survey and claims data, assess the association of each form of integration with utilization,
spending, and high-quality and equitable care for patients with cancer treated in health systems, and assess
mechanisms through which integration improves or worsens overall outcomes and equitable care for
marginalized subgroups based on race and ethnicity, rural residence, and area-level social deprivation."
10935522,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Project 2 - Care Integration for Patients with Cancer Treated in
Independent Practices
The goal of this Project is to describe care integration for patients with cancer treated in independent oncology
practices and to identify forms of care integration associated with better quality and outcomes. Many cancer
patients are treated by medical oncologists in independent practices. Their clinicians must deliver high-quality
care while also coordinating care across different types of clinicians (e.g., surgeon, radiation oncologist,
pharmacists) and multiple settings (e.g., office, pharmacy, hospital, post-acute care and hospice). Medical
oncologists have key roles in patients’ initial evaluation, treatment initiation, coordination of multidisciplinary
treatment, survivorship care, and palliative and end-of-life care. Project 2 will describe key forms of care
integration for medical oncology practices (structural, normative, functional, interpersonal, and process) and
assess relationships of different forms of integration with one another (e.g., extent of structural integration with
strength of interpersonal integration) and with outcomes demonstrating integrated care for patients. Working
with Projects 1, 2, and 4 and the Cores, the team will conduct case studies to learn about mechanisms by
which independent oncology practices achieve care integration and to adapt and tailor measures of integration
to oncology care. The team will survey practice leaders, managers, clinicians, staff, and patients from a
representative sample of independent practices to measure various forms of integration. Using administrative
data from Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial insurers, the team will measure key outcomes (including quality
of care, utilization, and spending) and examine relationships between these outcomes and various forms of
integration. At each step in the investigation, we examine how integration relates to care delivery and
outcomes for historically marginalized subgroups. Project 2 aims mirror the overall Project aims:
Aim 1: Adapt an existing framework and measurement concepts to describe key forms of integration beyond
structural (i.e., functional, normative, interpersonal, process) for oncology care delivered in independent
oncology practices using case studies and interviews. Identify mechanisms through which forms of integration
may yield improved and more equitable patient care and better outcomes.
Aim 2: Measure care integration in independent practices and assess relationships among different forms of
care integration. Determine how and whether these relationships vary by practice and market factors.
Aim 3. Assess the association of each form of integration with utilization, spending, and high-quality and
equitable care delivered in independent oncology practices and assess mechanisms through which integration
improves or worsens overall outcomes and equitable care for marginalized subgroups.
Defining and assessing how independent practices integrate oncology care and how clinicians and patients
experience care integration across the cancer care continuum and understanding how integration is associated
with important outcomes will inform policies and practices that improve patient outcomes."

Different cognitive behaviors appear to engage distinct activity patters across brain-wide circuits. This distributed
nature poses a big challenge to understanding which specific activity patterns are causal to different behaviors,
for a few reasons. First, it is technically challenging to perturb neural activity at large scales. Second, the same
brain regions are often involved in disparate cognitive processes, but they appear to interact and communicate
differently depending on behavioral demands. Third, cognitive behaviors do not exist in a vacuum. For example,
you may walk around as you deliberate about your future college, but that action is not required for the decision.
Thus, to truly understand the neural mechanisms of cognition, we need to use circuit perturbations to disentangle
distributed neural activity and interaction patterns that are causal to a behavior from those that are simply
incidental to it. Perturbation methods currently available to neuroscientists cannot accomplish this because they
tend to target one or few regions at a time, and not account for inadvertent changes in the activity of other
interconnected brain regions. To address these challenges, we propose to develop a new set of methodologies
for simultaneous, distributed perturbation of multiple cortical regions using patterned light. Specifically, we will
design a custom apparatus for head-fixed mice that uses a digital micromirror device to deliver spatially
stochastic light patters at cortex-wide scales. This will allow us to borrow concepts from systems identification,
used in electrical engineering and sensory-receptive-field mapping, to infer how large-scale patterns of cortical
activity underlie decision-making behaviors in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we will first develop an open-
source hardware and software suite to enable these experiments, which will be disseminated to the community
at large. We will then perform proof-of-principle experiments in which we will combine spatially stochastic
optogenetics with reflectance imaging or extracellular electrophysiological recordings using silicon probes, to
estimate distributed cortico-cortical interactions in mice running spontaneously. Finally, we will employ these
approaches in mice performing two ground-truth decision-making tasks in virtual reality, for which we have strong
expectations for the patters of behavioral deficits caused by the perturbation of different cortical areas. These
initial experiments will therefore establish the feasibility and showcase the versatility of our approach. They will
also pave the way for future work using these new methods to probe how distributed cortical interactions support
complex cognitive tasks. I expect the methods we develop will be readily applicable to multiple other behaviors,
neural systems, and model organisms to reveal the elusive causal link between neural interactions and
behavioral function."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a set of neurodevelopmental conditions that affect communication and social
interactions with restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Although ASD has one of the highest heritability
rates of all complex disorders, and hundreds of genes are known to confer a risk for this condition, most ASD
cases remain idiopathic. A critical barrier to progress in the field is to identify additional ASD-risk genes. Since
most of the known ASD variants are biased toward coding regions, an unmet need is to evaluate the contribution
of noncoding sequences in ASD etiology, including tandem repeats (TRs) that account for ~5% of the human
genome. Recently two independent large-scale genome studies uncovered previously undetected and
predominantly noncoding TR mutations that have been suggested to account for ~4% of idiopathic ASD cases.
Although these studies opened uncharted territory by revealing numerous TR expansion mutations (TRexp) in
ASD, they were underpowered to adopt the required statistical rigor to select gene candidates for further
mechanistic studies. To overcome this critical barrier to progress in the field, we designed a framework to
investigate the contribution of noncoding TRexp in ASD etiology. Based on our considerable expertise in complex
TRexp disease mechanisms, we propose to test the central hypothesis that ASD-associated noncoding TRexp
contribute to ASD etiology by inducing pathogenic gene regulatory mechanisms that have been documented in
other TRexp disorders. We will test our central hypothesis by: (i) identifying high-confidence ASD-risk genes with
TRexp enriched in the ASD population (Aim 1); (ii) selecting TRexp based on their propensity to perturb high-
confidence ASD-risk gene transcript processing (Aim 2); (iii) testing the hypothesis that intronic TRexp alter
specific regulatory steps during ASD-risk gene RNA processing (Aim 3). The results of this proposal will
transform our understanding of ASD by addressing important problems underpinning critical barriers to progress
in the field by: (i) providing a new approach to identify high-confidence ASD-risk genes from underpowered
studies; (ii) developing specialized criteria to estimate TRexp propensity to perturb ASD-risk gene expression and
RNA processing patterns; (iii) spanning the bridge between genomic TRexp findings in the ASD population and
their mechanistic basis. In addition, this proposal is designed to: (iv) provide a high number of underrepresented
students with the opportunity to participate in high-quality computational and molecular biology research
including study execution, analysis, and reporting; (v) substantially strengthen our research environment by
enhancing the PI’s research productivity and program development. Therefore, this proposal addresses the
requirements listed for the SuRE-First Award (PAR-21-173) and also falls within the areas of priority detailed in
the NIMH Strategic Plan and the NIMH Strategic Research Priorities."

We hypothesize that we can increase systemically develop a progressive murine TBI-ADRD model with internal
and external validity with a “Team-Science”-based two-phase ADRD-relevant phenotype enrichment strategy.
This 'Team Science' framework allows us to leverage and integrate the complementary experience and expertise
our 5-site multidisciplinary animal model testing team. This collaborative design aims to improve model
reproducibility by testing each model at two sites, and the use of standard operation procedure (SOP), common
data elements, (CDE) for method/data collection harmonization. At each stage, we will evaluate all data collected,
and model advancement are based on a multi-domain 'ADRD assessment: (a) development of robust ADRD-
relevant neurocognitive and neurobehavioral deficit phenotypes (primary), (b) development of ADRD-relevant
proteinopathy-linked neuropathologic phenotypes (primary), (c) Positive ex vivo proteinopathy signature using
brain lysate thioflavin-T protein aggregation assay, (d) progressiveness of neurobehavioral / proteinopathy
phenotypes, and (e) cross-site reproducibility of ADRD phenotypic features.
Aim 1. Phase I: Examine and screen for mouse strain determinants and TBI injury types that might favor post
TBI-ADRD formation and progression. We will conduct a systematic screen of diverse mouse strain determinants
affecting TBI-ADRD formation, including four strains (e.g., CD1, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, C57BL/6) and two distinct
TBI models (controlled cortical impact/CCI, and repeated close head injury/rCHI). At interim and terminal 18
month endpoints, we will apply a carefully selected multi-domain 'ADRD assessment panel’ (mentioned above)
to evaluate the development and progression of post-TBI ADRD-like neuropathologies,
neurobiochemical/biomarker signatures, and neurocognitive/memory deficit assessments. The highest-ranked
TBI-ADRD paradigm will advance to Phase II. Aim 2. Phase II. Using the selected mouse strain/injury model
candidate, introduce and evaluate two TBI-ADRD model enrichment factors. We will introduce secondary ADRD-
augmentation factors, including neuroinflammation and mouse/human-derived pathologic seeding materials for
polyproteinopathy transmission, The final deliverable of this project is an optimized, validated, and molecularly
characterized murine TBI-ADRD model that accurately recapitulates the key progressive neuropathology,
neurobiochemical signatures/biomarker expressions, and cognitive deficit phenotypic features of human TBI-
ADRD. Aim 3. Implement TBI-ADRD model dissemination to facilitate its use by other TBI investigators. We will
commit resources necessary to facilitate the dissemination of our findings and enable other researchers to
reproduce our TBI-ADRD model and key findings and improve on it, All our SOP and data will be uploaded to
the PRECISE-TBI endorsed OCD-TBI preclinical TBI data-sharing consortium for open access."
10933824,"Immune related adverse events (irAEs) secondary to checkpoint blockade inhibition (CBI) or other immune
modulatory therapy for cancer, including head and neck cancers, are a significant problem given the increasing
use of CBI and other immunomodulatory agents. It is therefore of critical importance to improve understanding
and optimize treatment regimens for irAEs. Oral mucosal irAE toxicity is relatively understudied despite the
potentially significant morbidity to patients. Understanding oral mucosal irAEs is an immediately accessible
window into the autoimmune pathology caused by ICB. Lessons from oral mucosal irAEs thus can inform
approaches to other irAEs. Our objective is to define T cell-based mechanisms of oral mucosal irAEs due to anti-
PD-1 therapy. This work will also further our goal to identify predictive markers of oral mucosal irAEs through
improved knowledge of their pathogenesis. Our central hypotheses are that regulatory T cell (Treg) plasticity is
a major driver of oral mucosal irAEs, with IL-17A being a key cytokine driver of mucosal toxicity. These
hypotheses build on prior work to define molecular signatures of T cells causative of muco-cutaneous eruptions.
We will test these hypotheses using an innovative combination of approaches including analysis of human
samples, mouse models that can generate similarly behaving irAEs, and generation and analysis of patient-
derived organoids (PDOs). Our team of experts in immunology, immunotherapy, head and neck cancer, and
bioinformatics will test this central hypothesis and achieve our objective via the following specific aims: 1)
Determine functional significance of Treg and Th17 balance in oral mucosal irAEs. 2) Investigate mechanistically
focused strategies to mitigate mucosal irAEs in murine models. 3) Validate therapeutic strategies to mitigate
irAEs in patient-derived irAE organoid models. We will utilize our expertise in single cell RNA sequencing and
PDOs to accomplish these aims. At the end of the project, the expected outcome is to better understand the
pathophysiological mechanisms of oral mucosal irAEs and have identified strategies that can treat or modulate
these, for future clinical trials. We will also be able to generate the mechanistic basis for future strategies to
rapidly mitigate or even prevent these irAEs, which will ultimately benefit HNSCC and other cancer patients."

The need to train scientists to conduct fungal research is greater than ever. Worldwide estimates of human
fungal disease include over a billion people with invasive, allergic, or chronic fungal diseases. Plant diseases,
caused predominantly by fungi, are estimated to reduce global food yields by 20-40%. These striking statistics
showcase the immense human and financial tolls imparted by fungal diseases. Our objective is to develop
molecular mycology scientists trained in the latest methods of laboratory, translational, or clinical research who
are fully prepared to pursue independent research careers investigating the many aspects of fungal diseases.
The Tri-Institutional Molecular Mycology and Pathogenesis Training Program (Tri-I MMPTP) has been funded
since 2003 to recruit, support, and train promising postdoctoral scientists and physicians to develop productive
research careers. It is the only mycology-focused postdoctoral training program in existence, and it has been
highly successful in training the next generation of outstanding scientists. The tremendous productivity of this
training program is predicated on its unique design, leveraging the proximity of three prominent research
universities: Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University.
These institutions offer arguably the highest geographic concentration of researchers who study fungi in the
country. The Tri-I MMPTP has trained or is currently training a total of >50 post-doctoral fellows, many of whom
have gone on to lead independent NIH-funded laboratories, lead government research efforts, work in industry
on cutting-edge projects, and assume positions of leadership in academia, government, and industry. At many
institutions, faculty who investigate medical fungi have little contact with geneticists who work on model fungi,
biochemists studying cellular mechanisms, or infectious diseases physicians who care for immunocompromised
patients. Similarly, those who study phytopathogens and fungal symbionts of plants are intellectually, and often
physically, removed from biomedical researchers. A proven concept underlying our multidisciplinary interaction
is that clinical and basic researchers, and plant and animal mycologists, together discover new approaches that
are mutually beneficial. With this integrated design, our trainees become broadly knowledgeable, versatile, and
more attractive to prospective employers. Several outstanding training themes are responsible for our continued
success: careful selection from a large pool of competitive applicants, promotion of diversity (including a
significant number of trainees from under-represented backgrounds), and centralized courses on scientific/grant
writing. These opportunities are all connected through trainee Individual Research Advisory Committees. At the
core is our dedicated mentorship, including a pathway to independence mentality and a formalized continued
mentorship program for three years after program completion. Our interconnected strategy has generated highly
successful scientists for two decades, and our constant programmatic updates via trainee and mentor feedback
have developed exciting approaches to fill the need for molecular mycologists."

The Training Program in Tumor Microenvironment (TPTM) formerly Cancer Biology Training
Program (CBTP) at the University of Michigan, currently in its 30th year, is an interdisciplinary
program whose central goal is to train exceptional junior investigators to address fundamental
biological problems related to human cancer. The TPTM appoints four predoctoral and two
postdoctoral scholars annually for up to two years each, with independent research opportunities
focusing on a wide choice of topics in the field of cancer biology. In addition, the TPTM provides
these trainees with didactic coursework and programmatic activities, including retreats, visiting
speaker series, and research-in-progress seminars, that expose them to the depth and breadth
of cancer research across diverse disciplines. The TPTM draws its strength from: the participation
of 28 faculty members from 14 basic science and clinical departments and programs within the
University of Michigan; its association with the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center
(Rogel); and its involvement with the Program in Biomedical Sciences and Medical Scientist
Training Program, through which graduate students are recruited. Senior TPTM faculty are all
leaders in their respective fields and have outstanding track records of research productivity and
of mentoring young scientists. Junior TPTM faculty have demonstrated potential to develop into
future leaders and display a strong commitment to mentorship and training. Administrative
oversight of the TPTM will be performed by the PI/PDs, Drs. Castro and Difeo, in consultation
with associate director Dr. Canman and the TPTM steering committee. Ongoing evaluation of the
program and its leadership will be performed by the Rogel leadership, TPTM faculty members,
the external advisory board, and by the trainees themselves, especially in the first three years
following graduation from the program. Postdoctoral fellow appointees will have completed a
Ph.D. degree in one of the physical or biological sciences no more than two years prior to
appointment to the TPTM. M.D. and M.D./Ph.D. trainees with a clear commitment to pursuing
independent careers in academic cancer biology research will also be eligible for appointment.
Predoctoral students will comprise a subset of students in their second or third year of graduate
school who have been accepted into the Doctoral Program in Cancer Biology. All trainees will
have demonstrated a significant interest in pursuing a career in some aspect of cancer-related
research. Predoctoral trainees will be expected to graduate to outstanding postdoctoral positions,
while postdoctoral trainees should assume independent research positions in academia or
industry."

Neutrophils are terminally differentiated cells of the innate immune system that are necessary for host defense.
Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils have more heterogeneity and plasticity than previously thought.
However, there is a gap in understanding neutrophil developmental heterogeneity and function because they
are short-lived ex vivo and are not genetically tractable. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived human
neutrophils (iNeutrophls) offer the opportunity to genetically and developmentally program neutrophils for
designed properties that may be used both to understand neutrophil biology and provide an avenue for
engineering neutrophils for human treatment. We have engineered GMP-compatible human iNeutrophils that
show antimicrobial function in vitro but display significant heterogeneity with distinct subtypes based on
preliminary single cell analysis. Our preliminary data also suggest that LPS treatment of progenitor cells “trains”
the iNeutrophils for an increased responsiveness to secondary stimuli. Here we propose to use single-cell
multi-omics to understand the heterogeneity and function of iNeutrophils and to test the hypothesis that
iNeutrophils can be used to understand the metabolic and genomic mechanisms of trained immunity of
human neutrophils. Specifically, will use single-cell multi-omics and optical metabolic imaging to identify the
transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic heterogeneity that could inform functions of distinct iNeutrophil subsets
and the effects of immune training. We will also develop zebrafish larvae as an in vivo model to screen for
iNeutrophil antimicrobial functions in models of bacterial and fungal infection. The proposed work will provide a
genetically tractable system to understand the heterogeneity of human neutrophils, and the effect of immune
training on neutrophil function that may optimize for antimicrobial effects."

Humans and great apes share many similarities in age-related illnesses including cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases. Nevertheless, critical differences exist that may be key to understanding the
precipitous age-based cognitive decline observed in some humans that is less evident in apes. For instance,
humans can live nearly twice as long as the oldest recorded great ape. Additionally, despite being our closest
evolutionary relatives, the principal cause of heart disease differs between humans and great apes. The most
frequent type of cardiovascular disease in elderly humans is coronary artery disease due to atherosclerosis,
whereas great apes are highly prone to cardiomyopathy-associated heart failure. Why heart disease varies
between apes and humans and how it potentially relates to cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairments
are important unanswered questions, which may shed light on the unique human vulnerability to these
pathologies that affect lifespan. Here, we will examine the impact of cardiovascular health on longevity, the brain,
and diseases of aging in humans and great apes including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans. In
Aim 1, we will evaluate the effect of aging, cardiovascular disease, and neurovascular health on the brains of
humans and great apes. Using stereology and electron microscopy, we will measure neuron and glial cell
densities, synapse and mitochondrial densities, and other age-related cerebrovascular pathology in humans and
great apes across their lifespans and in individuals with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
Multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging of age- and cerebrovascular-related neuropathology (e.g., cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, Alzheimer’s disease lesions) also will be performed in each species. In Aim 2, the proposed
studies will identify and determine if age-related vascular risk factors are associated with cognitive impairment
in great apes. We will use archival MRI brain scans to identify potential volumetric changes associated with age
and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases as well as evaluate for the presence of neurovascular-related
lesions, such as white matter hyperintensities. Furthermore, we will quantify white matter microvessel,
endovascular cell, and vascular length densities from humans and apes to investigate associations with age,
species, and disease status. We will investigate cellular localization of CD36, a protein involved in lipid
metabolism that may differ between species, in fixed postmortem brains from humans and apes. In Aim 3, our
studies will examine how age and cardiovascular health influence cognition in chimpanzees compared to
humans. This will include retrospective and prospective analyses between measures derived from transthoracic
echocardiograms with cognitive and motor function as well as several biomarkers of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases in chimpanzees. Taken together, outcomes from our proposed studies will provide
insights into how cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease differentially contribute to the health, cognition,
and lifespan of apes and humans."

The visual accessibility of a space refers to the effectiveness with which vision can be used to travel safely and
pursue intended activities in the space. Visual accessibility of a space reduces significantly for impaired vision,
leading to higher risks of encountering hazardous situations, falling, and being disoriented in navigation. It is
possible to improve the environmental accessibility by enhancing the visibility of informative or hazardous
features through cost-effective modifications of contrast, illumination, and materials. However, it is difficult for
people with normal vision, even those with rehab expertise, to judge whether specific objects or features would
be visible for individuals with different levels of vision impairment, or to examine the efficacy of modifications.
 This research aims to develop an objective tool for evaluating the accessibility of indoor spaces to
complement the current observational practice in visual environmental evaluation. This tool will be
implemented as a smartphone app for easy use by rehab specialists and the general public. Using computer
vision algorithms, RGB camera and LiDAR sensing technology, the tool will 1) visualize an environment for a
specified level of vision impairment, 2) flag hazardous features, such as edges of stairs and chairs that are not
visible for this level of vision, and 3) generate visibility metrics that quantify the visibility for a given object to the
level of vision. The development and validation of this tool will be conducted in environments with different
levels of realism including high-dynamic range images on digital displays, controlled lab spaces simulating real
environments, and real clinical and home environments. The engineering approaches will be established
through rigorous sensor testing in real environments. The computational algorithms will be developed using a
large database of visibility ratings by low vision participants. The app will be first validated in controlled
laboratory environments and then implemented in complex real environments including eye clinics and homes.
 This research strives to support the highest level of independence for people with vision impairment
before they need to rely on assistive technology or human assistance. This endeavor is supported by a team
with expertise in low vision research and rehabilitation, computer vision and modeling, architecture lighting and
design, and assistive technology development. The proposed tool will facilitate the services provided by rehab
specialists, caregivers, and facility managers in environmental evaluation and modification which will in turn
enhance safety and independence in people with vision impairment. It will also facilitate telehealth by allowing
easy sharing of home evaluation results. A tool that provides quantitative measures will contribute to the
consciousness-raising of visual accessibility among the public. The engineering and computational
approaches, once established, can be extended to platforms other than the smartphone models in the current
development phase and can generalize to broader environmental contexts."

This application is being submitted in response to NOT-AG-23-032. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive
neurodegenerative brain disease and the most common cause of dementia in older adults. So far, no cure has
been found for AD yet. The dilemma and hurdles for the treatment of AD are not only limited due to the lack of
effective therapeutic molecules but also due to their inability to penetrate the basement membrane of the blood-
brain-barrier (BBB) and reach the specific target site to treat the disease. Accumulating evidence supports the
coexistence of sarcopenia and cognitive dysfunction with aging. Myokines released from the muscle play a
pivotal role in facilitating communication between skeletal muscle and the brain. Consequently, therapies
targeting this link associated with AD could potentially ameliorate AD-related cognitive decline. While working on
our parent grant, we discovered that extracellular vesicles (EVs) released from muscle progenitor cells generated
from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with givinostat (Givi-MPC) were effective for muscle regeneration
during aging. The proteomic profiling revealed that neuropeptides enriched EVs could be important therapeutic
target for AD, neurogenesis, and neuroprotection. Recent studies further substantiate this by demonstrating that
EVs can readily cross the BBB to deliver bioactive molecules to the central nervous system. Accordingly, we
hypothesize that Givi-MPC derived EVs effectively counteract the neurotoxic effects of AD pathology. However,
development of AD drugs effective in animal failed to translate into interventions in humans. Therefore, a shift
towards a human-relevant preclinical model is imperative in the development of drugs for AD. Organoids
emerged as promising preclinical models in reproducing the AD hallmarks including Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary
tangles as well as promotion of neurodegenerative inflammation. Thus, we will test the efficacy of EVs from Givi-
MPC using AD patient specific iPSC derived cerebral organoids (Aim 1) and 5XFAD transgenic mice (Aim 2). In
Aim 1, we will evaluate the therapeutic effect of Givi-MPC derived EVs on Aβ amyloid deposits, neuronal viability,
and connectivity in AD cerebral organoids. Additionally, we will employ single cell RNA sequence to reveal the
clues for underlying mechanism of protection by EVs. In Aim 2, we will assess AD pathology and cognitive
function through systemic delivery of EVs in 5XFAD transgenic mice. Successful completion of this supplement
could provide a novel and potentially effective EV-based treatment for AD."

 Obesity is a major public health problem that is related to a variety of illnesses, such as heart disease
and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for obesity, possibly through
alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully clear how these alterations contribute to obesity.
In this study, we examine how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination are related to eating
behaviors and dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM) axis.
Our prior research has suggested that BGM alterations play an important role in the development of obesity.
Our study focuses on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that they encounter a high burden
of obesity as well as exposure to social stressors.
 We will screen and enroll approximately 300 Mexican and Filipina women who will then provide
information about social stressors via a survey, dietician-administered 24-hour food recall, measured
anthropometrics (e.g. waist circumference), questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and
accelerometer data on physical activity. Stool and serum to determine microbial-related measures (16sRNA
sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and metabolomics), and MRI to assess brain alterations in the extended
reward network will be collected. Advanced multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from
multiple data sources (neuroimaging, microbiome and metabolite profiles, survey data, diet, and
clinical/behavioral data). This analysis will determine the unique variance associated with ethnicity and social
stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns, and the BGM axis related to obesity. An
integrated systems investigative approach such as the one proposed is a critical step to understanding the
mechanisms contributing to obesity. Further the impact of how environmental stressors “get under the skin”
and impact eating behaviors and diet patterns and the BGM axis is important in addressing health disparities in
ethnic groups and in women. This premise guides the specific aims of this proposal: Aim A: We will phenotype
the influence of stressors on brain signatures and eating patterns in obesity. Aim B: We will phenotype the
influence of stressors on gut microbiome and metabolites in obesity. Aim C: We will apply advanced analytical
techniques in order to determine ethnic differences in the influence of stressors on the BGM axis in obesity.
 The results of this study will provide novel information about a possible pathway whereby social
stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk. It will also provide
new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long term, this research may
suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce inequalities in obesity and related health
problems."

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a nuclear histone demethylase. Our work shows that LSD1 expression
progressively increases with tumor grade and stage in clinical oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our long-
term goal is to evaluate LSD1 mechanism in progressive oral malignancy based on preliminary studies for
therapeutic applications. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue
epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling
network, and Pd-L1 expression. Next, the topical application of LSD1 inhibitor during dysplasia prevented its
progression to invasive phenotype, attenuated pathological lesions, expression of Hippo signaling effectors (Yap,
Taz, Ccn2,) and immune checkpoints (Pd-1, and Pd-l1). LSD1 inhibitor sensitized OSCC to combinations with
either YAP inhibitor, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, limiting tumor progression in vivo. Thus, we showed
for the first time that blocking LSD1 inhibits preneoplasia, a feed-forward loop during the progression of
dysplasia to OSCC. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two
independent studies 1) proteomics analysis of LSD knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq
analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. However, the mechanism of LSD1 function, its target cells in progressive oral
malignancy, and how LSD1 promotes IL-6-JAK-STAT3 remain unclear. This knowledge gap prevents the
targeted design of effective new epigenetic therapeutic strategies for OSCC. We hypothesize that (1) LSD1
upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and
induced cell types and (2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive
malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. Using clinically relevant animal models, this project is well-
positioned to address the following Specific Aims: 1) to determine how upregulated LSD1 epigenetically
reprogram dysplasia to promote IL6 network during progressive oral preneoplasia invasive phenotype; 2) to
determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network induced invasive phenotype in
preneoplasia, and 3) to determine the translational importance of pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse
preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling induced cancer stem and immune cells. The successful
completion of the proposed project is expected to identify LSD1 and therapeutic application mechanisms in the
IL6-JAK-STAT3 network, related stem cells, and immune cells. Finally, the study will determine if LSD1 a role
in anti-PD-1 immunotherapy resistance and pharmacological LSD1 inhibition can attenuate feline OSCC for a
potential application in veterinary and human medicine. Overall, the study will have a broader impact on future
translational studies in human preneoplasia."

This administrative supplement will support pilot work to quantify the effect of structural white advantage
(SWA) – policies and practices that provide greater resources and power to people racialized as white – on
cognitive health and ADRD risk among older US adults. The SWA framework complements structural racism
work by specifying the US context in which white racialization predominates the social hierarchy, providing insight
into how structural advantages promote cumulative cognitive health and the reduction of ADRD risk in later life
relative to multiple ethno-racial groups. Understanding the link between SWA and cognitive health may reveal
the effectiveness of policies/programs that target the distribution of resources to dominated groups (non-white)
to promote health equity. Additionally, the SWA framework provides a theoretical grounding to dissect potential
heterogeneities in cognitive reserve processes and outcomes among those racialized as white, providing
additional clues on how the intersection among structural inequities (e.g., SWA and classism) drives ADRD
disparities at the population level. A vital step in linking SWA to cognitive health is to operationalize and measure
SWA. The proposed project will 1) use administrative data to measure differential access to resources and power
between white and non-white groups and 2) apply confirmatory factor analysis to derive the SWA index. The
objective of the proposed project is to quantify the later-life cognitive health effects of SWA exposure in early
life and midlife for white, Black, and Hispanic participants from the nationally representative Health and
Retirement Survey. Results from the proposed supplement project will provide preliminary data for an R01
proposal that will examine relationships between SWA exposure and ADRD outcomes across additional NIA-
funded cohorts and assess for differential impacts by population and geography and intervening biological
mechanisms on cognitive function and ADRD risk. The R01 will also develop and test upstream structural
measures of the policies and practices that produce SWA to identify targets for potential interventions to reduce
ADRD disparities.
The proposed supplement aligns with the overall aims of the Minnesota Life Course Center for the Demography
and Economics of Aging (LCC) in three ways. (1) It brings together a new interdisciplinary team to support the
development of a promising junior scholar moving into research on the structural determinants of cognitive
health. (2) It will generate evidence of exposure to structural equities in early and midlife as a predictor of the
late-life risk of and racial disparities in ADRD risk among older adults. (3) Making the SWA indexes publicly
available aligns with the goals of the LCC’s External Innovative Network Core (the Network for Data-Intensive
Research on Aging [NDIRA]), which supports the use of novel data for research on population aging."
10925166,"Project Summary
The PI’s laboratory focuses on mathematical modeling of spatiotemporal and mechanical processes in living
cells, as well as their coupling to biochemical regulatory pathways. Although critical for many cellular functions,
spatiotemporal and mechanical processes remain poorly understood. Experimentally, it is yet impossible to
simultaneously track the spatiotemporal and mechanical dynamics of multiple molecular species involved in
complex cellular functions, which hinders coherent mechanistic understanding. Mathematical modeling presents
a powerful tool that can integrate heterogeneous data with basic laws of physics and chemistry, propose coherent
mechanistic frameworks, and guide new experiments. Due to many strong physical constraints, modeling the
spatiotemporal and mechanical dynamics in a cell can be more tractable than modeling the complex signaling
networks, and can provide a central framework to which additional biological details can be gradually added.
Equipped with her rich experience in modeling cellular spatiotemporal and mechanical dynamics and their
feedback with biochemical signaling, the PI will focus her research over the next five years on several topics in
two areas of cell biology that involve salient spatiotemporal and mechanical dynamics. The first area is mitotic
spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. The PI’s research in this area will elucidate how the
spatiotemporal, mechanical and biochemical dynamics interplay to achieve proper spindle assembly and faithful
chromosome segregation. The research will particularly focus on the cellular mechanisms behind centrosome
clustering and chromosome oscillation. The proper execution of these mechanisms and their dysfunction have
strong implications in cancer. Hence, knowledge to be obtained from this study will illuminate future innovations
in cancer therapy. The second area is bacterial motility and control. The PI’s research in this area will tackle how
bacterial motility is driven, regulated and coordinated, processes that are critical for formation and organization
of microbial communities like biofilms. The research will focus on two novel gliding motilities found in Myxococcus
xanthus and Clostridium perfringens. Both motilities involve intriguing intercellular interactions, either for
coordinating motility between individual cells, or for supplying the driving force. Knowledge to be generated by
the study will stimulate future health-related innovations, such as novel antimicrobial treatments and bacterial
therapeutic agents. Last but not least, the PI will develop new methodology to address the challenge of
comparing traditional, physics-based models with noisy data obtained through the latest experimental
technologies. Particularly, she will introduce Bayesian inference to her modeling research and streamline the
methodology for the data and models in the specific research topics. These methods will be transferable to other
research in the field of quantitative cell biology where similar challenges in model-data comparison arise."
10925167,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vaso-occlusive painful episodes (VOE) in sickle cell disease (SCD) are the leading cause of hospitalizations,
emergency room (ED) visits, missed school, & are associated with an increased mortality rate. There are no
current therapies to relieve vaso-occlusion, with interventions limited to hydration and analgesia. Nitric oxide
(NO), produced by the 5-electron oxidation of L-arginine, is a potent vasodilator & exerts pleiotropic effects on
vascular & circulating blood cells, including the inhibition of platelet aggregation, down-regulation of adhesion
molecules, & modulation of ischemia-reperfusion injury, all pathways adversely affected during VOE. We have
found that pediatric SCD patients admitted with VOE have depleted plasma L-arginine levels. Additionally, we
have now completed a single-center randomize, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of arginine therapy in
54 children with VOE requiring hospitalization. We observed a reduction in total opioid use (mg/kg) by 54% and
significantly lower pain scores at discharge in children who received 5 days IV L-arginine therapy every 8 hours
compared to placebo, as well as a clinically relevant trend in reduced length of hospital stay of approximately 17
hours. In pharmacokinetic studies, we found that IV arginine induced a dose-dependent improvement in
mitochondrial function in children with SCD hospitalized for pain. We now propose to extend these results to a
pivotal phase 3 trial of L-arginine for VOE. We hypothesize that arginine is a safe intervention with narcotic-
sparing effects in pediatric SCD patients with VOE that will decrease the time children experience severe pain.
Aim 1 of this study will determine the efficacy of IV arginine therapy on the primary endpoint, time-to-crisis
resolution, as well as total parenteral opioid use (mg/kg) and pain scores in children with SCD & VOE compared
to placebo (Efficacy). Aim 2 will monitor for safety of IV L-arginine (Safety). Aim 3 will characterize alterations in
the arginine metabolome and mitochondrial function in children with SCD and VOE, and evaluate how it is
impacted by IV arginine therapy, while also creating a valuable biorepository of SCD-VOE blood samples for
future mechanism studies (Exploratory). This proposal will provide essential data for product development and
FDA regulatory approval for use of arginine in SCD. Acute care of patients with SCD & pain in the ED is a
neglected area of research. The results of this study may ultimately lead to change in clinical practice for children
with SCD in both the ED & inpatient hospital wards. ED-based studies and novel therapies that target
mechanisms of vaso-occlusion and pain are needed in SCD."

Engaging Partners in Caring Communities (EPICC) is designed to reduce health disparities
associated with chronic health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and cancer, by supporting delivery of evidence-based health promotion
programs in churches serving African American communities. This academic-community
partnership will support 30 churches in developing implementation teams of 4-5 members to
participate in tis project. They will have access to the EPICC App and website will be designed
with community input to guide implementation teams in selecting evidence-based programs
(EBPs) approved by federal agencies. They will then complete the web-based EPICC Survey
developed for this project to assess their organization’s capacity to implement the program they
select. This will be used to identify facilitators and challenges they may face as they offer the
EBP in their congregation. The research team will use a recently developed analytic tool to
guide them in offering technical assistance based on the results of that survey.
This mixed methods step-wedge cluster randomized trial will provide information about the
approach to disseminating information about EBPs to faith-based communities, assessing
strengths and challenges, and delivering technical assistance to build church capacity to
promote health. It is also designed to bring implementation teams from participating churches
together in a learning collaborative to identify and address social determinants of health that
constitute additional impediments to health equity. will also bring implementation teams
together to identify and address social determinants of health that are relevant to their shared
goals.
Successful completion of this project will potentially transform approaches to community
engagement and empowerment to improve health equity. The Partners who will be engaged in
this project include four academic faculty from two historically Black colleges/universities
(HBCUs) who will offer graduate and undergraduate students opportunities to participate in
community-engaged research, learn about implementation science, observe and reflect on
development and deployment of several technological products designed with community input."
10925709,"Project Summary
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) stands as the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder,
affecting between 5-10% of children worldwide. Over the past two decades, the diagnosis rate for childhood
ADHD have surged, resulting in a substantial societal and economic burden on those impacted individuals,
their families, and the broader community. ADHD is characterized by compromised cognitive control, yielding
adverse life-long consequences for academic and social functioning. Cognitive theories of ADHD have
hypothesized that deficiencies in cognitive control and motivational systems might underlie behavioral
problems in ADHD. Modern perspectives in neuroscience underscore the latent dynamics of brain as pivotal
for comprehending both functional and dysfunctional cognitive processes. The proposed research undertakes
the investigation of intricate interplay between intrinsic brain mechanisms, task-modulated brain dynamics, and
behavioral and clinical symptoms associated with ADHD. The study has three main aims. The first aim is to
examine the intrinsic brain dynamics within the cognitive control and reward systems in children with ADHD,
and how aberrant intrinsic brain dynamics might be linked to deficits in functional circuitry when affected
children are engaged in cognitively demanding task. The second aim focuses on studying how intrinsic and
task-modulated brain dynamics are associated with cognitive control deficits and clinical symptoms in children
with ADHD. The third aim involves testing reproducibility and generalizability of the association between brain
dynamics and symptoms using datasets collected independently in the United States and Japan. The
proposed research significantly augment the scope of the funded parent grant (MH124816) by unveiling the
intricate relationship between intrinsic and task-modulated brain dynamics mechanism and their interplay with
childhood ADHD. The study capitalizes on multidisciplinary expertise in psychiatry, computational sciences,
statistics, cognitive neuroscience, psychology, brain imaging and neurology. Moreover, it builds on our recent
studies in developing advanced computational methodologies to solve important problems in cognitive,
systems and clinical neuroscience. The ultimate goal of the supplement proposal is to propel our
understanding of the foundational neural mechanisms underpinning childhood ADHD. The findings will
facilitate developing more targeted and efficient interventions for childhood ADHD in the future. Our cognitive,
neuroscience and computational framework developed here can be widely applied to study many psychiatric
disorders that manifest similar cognitive deficits, such as schizophrenia and autism."
10922647,"Project Summary/Abstract
AutoChamber is part of an initiative spearheaded by HeartLung.AI, in collaboration with a team of esteemed
physician researchers from leading US academic institutions. The AI tool is designed to opportunistically
screen existing chest CT scans stored in hospital PACS or new scans obtained for any medical evaluations
such as coronary artery calcium scan, lung cancer screening or diagnostic work ups following accidents or
pneumonia and such, to detect asymptomatic enlarged cardiac chambers and thick left ventricular wall without
any X-ray contrast enhanced agent. The human eye cannot distinguish between the inside of cardiac
chambers and the cardiac wall without contrast enhanced agent whereas, the AutoChamber AI which was
trained using contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scans can accurately detect and measure cardiac chambers
volume and left ventricular wall mass. The project underscores a significant stride towards addressing the
unmet needs in early detection and prevention of heart failure and stroke, potentially saving lives, and reducing
healthcare costs. It aligns with the mission of fostering innovative solutions that offer opportunistic diagnoses
using existing CT scans or CT scans obtained for other reasons unrelated to cardiovascular disease. Over 76
million CT scans were performed in the United States in 2019, an estimated 230 CT procedures per 1,000
people with chest CT accounting for 12.7 million that can be used for AutoChamber™ screening.
AutoChamber™ is the newest AI technology that has received a Medical Device Breakthrough Designation
from the FDA as recently as August 30, 2023.
Building upon the encouraging results gleaned from the MESA database, the project aims to extend its
research to the Framingham Heart Study database, the largest prospective cohort study of cardiovascular
diseases with a rich repository of thousands of CT scans to further validate the performance of
AutoChamber™.
The project delineates three specific aims:
Aim 1: To apply AutoChamber™ on CAC scans from the Framingham database and compare the cardiac
chamber volume measurements with those obtained from contrast-enhanced MRI.
Aim 2 To evaluate the performance of AutoChamber™ in predicting incidents of atrial fibrillation and stroke,
benchmarking against existing standards like the CHARGE-AF Score and CHADS-VASc Score.
Aim 3 To assess the capability of AutoChamber™ in detecting prevalent left ventricular hypertrophy and
asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, and predicting incidents of heart failure, using parameters like left
ventricular and left ventricular wall volumetry."
10926840,"Background: Perioperative mortality is 2-4 times higher in patients with cirrhosis compared to patients without
cirrhosis due to cirrhosis-related factors such as portal hypertension and impaired hepatic synthetic function.
Currently no models exist that accurately estimate peri-operative mortality and morbidity in patients with
cirrhosis. Our overarching aim is to develop and validate a Cirrhosis-specific Surgical Risk Calculator (C-
SuRC) that accurately estimates perioperative mortality and complications in patients with cirrhosis.
Significance/Impact: C-SuRC will improve the selection of patients with cirrhosis for surgical procedures, improve
access to elective surgery for patients with low mortality, prevent surgeries in patients with high mortality and
identify modifiable risk factors that could be optimized prior to surgery in order to improve outcomes.
Innovation:
 • C-SuRC will be the first surgical risk calculator specifically designed for patients with cirrhosis that
 incorporates all three major classes of predictors that contribute to operative mortality in patients with
 cirrhosis, that is cirrhosis-related, surgery-related and comorbidity-related predictors.
 • C-SuRC will be developed using a unique, dataset that we developed by merging VASQIP and CDW
 data. This is a nationally-representative VA dataset of cirrhotic patients undergoing surgical procedures
 with prospectively collected baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes.
 • We will develop and compare both traditional logistic regression models as well as state-of-the-art,
 gradient-boosted (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms.
 • We will use a novel method for interpreting the predictions of machine learning algorithms (SHAP), which
 assigns the contribution of each risk factor to the mortality predicted by the model. This has profound
 implications for “interpretable AI” in medical predictive analytics. SHAP values can be used to “explain”
 a prediction and to identify potentially modifiable factors that can be improved prior to surgery.
 • We will apply user-centered design to develop web-based and app-based tools that execute C-SuRC.
Specific Aims:
SA1. Develop and externally validate a model (C-SuRC) that accurately estimates 30-day postoperative
mortality and complications in patients with cirrhosis using routinely available cirrhosis-related,
comorbidity-related and surgery-related predictors.
SA2. Use a novel method (the SHapley Additive exPlanations or “SHAP”) to calculate the contribution of
each risk factor to the mortality risk predicted by our C-SuRC gradient boosted, machine learning models
in individual patients.
SA3. Incorporate feedback from users and apply best practices in user-centered design to develop web-
based and app-based tools that execute C-SuRC and display predictions of surgical outcomes in
individual patients and the contribution of each key risk factor to the predicted risk using SHAP values.
Methods: We will use conventional logistic regression models and state-of-the-art, gradient-boosted machine
learning models for C-SuRC development. We will test the discrimination, calibration and accuracy of C-SuRC,
externally validate it and compare it to existing surgical risk calculators. We will use SHAP values to calculate
the contribution each risk factor to the mortality predicted by the machine learning models. We will incorporate
feedback from 25 clinician-users to develop web-based and app-based tools that execute C-SuRC.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will solicit support from all important VA stakeholders, many of whom have
already endorsed this proposal, and disseminate our findings and the web-based and app-based C-SuRC
tools in the VA nationally as a routine instrument in the pre-operative assessment of patients with cirrhosis."

10934262,"OVERALL: PROJECT ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this renewal P01 proposal is to identify imaging and genomic signatures of brain tumor
heterogeneity and evolution to optimize patient management of the two most common primary brain tumors in
adults: glioblastoma and meningioma. The hallmark of glioblastoma is resistance to standard treatment with
rapid progression at the time of recurrence. Although meningioma can be slow growing, a major proportion recur
following standard surgery and radiation with a significant adverse impact on survival. A new, prognostically
distinct, classification of meningioma based on DNA-methylation was recently developed. This renewal P01 will
establish non-invasive imaging correlates of mechanistic genomic drivers of tumor evolution and intra-tumoral
heterogeneity (Projects 1 and 2), to uniquely identify new therapeutic targets that can be rapidly evaluated by
biologically relevant imaging metrics to assess early response to treatment (Projects 3 and 4).
Building upon the demonstration of genomic heterogeneity in these lesions along with the recent technical
advances in 1H and hyperpolarized 13C metabolic imaging that have facilitated the successful translation of [1-
13C] and [2-13C]-labeled pyruvate and enabled the development of a new imaging probe ([1-13C]alpha-
ketoglutarate) we will: i) elucidate spatial and temporal imaging correlates of genomic underpinnings of
intratumor heterogeneity and their functional impact in glioblastoma that confounds therapies (Project 1); ii)
characterize meningioma evolution and heterogeneity by defining genomic mechanisms and therapeutic
vulnerabilities that underlie imaging features of intratumor molecular heterogeneity (Project 2). 3-D imaging
models of genomic data will be generated in both Projects 1 and 2 with additional synergistic interactions based
approaches applied. Using 1H- and hyperpolarized 13C- MRS markers of NF2 loss and FOXM1 expression,
Project 3 will identify metabolic imaging biomarkers in the preclinical setting that can stratify molecular groups
of meningiomas. Project 4 will expand on Projects 1, 2 and 3 to develop and optimize novel 1H and 13C metabolic
imaging methods in patients in order to monitor early response to targeted therapy in recurrent glioblastoma,
and determine metabolic features of meningioma gene-expression groups, including with the development of a
new [1-13C]alanine probe. The Administrative & Clinical Services, Biospecimen & Biomarker, and Imaging Tumor
Heterogeneity & Metabolism Cores will be critical for directing and supporting all of the projects.
Leveraging the expertise, unique infrastructure at UCSF, translational strengths of the investigators, and
achievements to date from the current P01 and other NCI grants, the pioneering fundamental and translational
cancer research described in this proposal will accelerate the implementation of innovative experimental
genomic and metabolic imaging techniques. This rapid translation of non-invasive metabolic imaging and
genomic signatures to assess brain tumor heterogeneity and evolution will provide new insights into potential
therapeutic targets, enhance the evaluation of novel therapies, and assist in the optimal patient management."
10931178,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Childhood adversity is common and increases risk for multiple forms of psychopathology emerging in
adolescence. Heightened sensitivity to stress is one pathway through which childhood adversity may increase
mental health risk, such that stressful life events are more likely to lead to psychopathology in those who have
experienced childhood adversity. However, understanding of the impacts of childhood adversity has been
limited by conceptualization of adversity as a single construct and a focus on mechanisms, such as the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, that are challenging to intervene upon. Considerable evidence supports
the assertion that the impacts of adverse experiences on neural, cognitive, and affective functioning can be
categorized along dimensions of deprivation and threat. The proposed project investigates how deprivation and
threat may compromise two key affective skills through which youth reduce uncertainty to navigate stressors in
their daily lives: interoception and emotional granularity. Interoception is the brain’s modeling of the state of the
body. Youth exposed to threat may have lower interoceptive accuracy following stressors, increasing mental
health vulnerability to stress. Children who experience high levels of deprivation are likely not exposed to
experiences that support them in developing well differentiated emotion concepts and may consequently have
low emotional granularity, increasing their vulnerability to stress. The target sample is 200 adolescents (100
female) aged 11-20 years sampled to ensure high variability in exposure to deprivation and threat. Participants
will complete a baseline visit, engage in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) over 14 days, and complete
an online 18-month follow-up assessment. Childhood adversity, emotional granularity, interoceptive accuracy,
stress, and psychopathology will be assessed through multimodal assessments including questionnaires,
structured interviews, behavioral tasks, psychophysiology, and EMA. Analyses will evaluate the association
between threat and interoceptive accuracy (Aim 1), the association between deprivation and emotional
granularity (Aim 2), the role interoceptive accuracy in mental health vulnerability to stress (Aim 3), and the role
of emotional granularity in mental health vulnerability to stress (Aim 4). Interoception and emotional granularity
are common targets for existing interventions. However, their role in the link between childhood adversity and
psychopathology remains under-identified. This research has the potential to establish important sources of
risk and resilience for youth exposed to adversity with clear applications to treatment and preclinical
interventions. Students will be integral to executing every aspect of this research plan, including task
development, recruitment, data collection, data processing, and data analysis. The execution of this research
will provide in-depth research experience to students from minoritized backgrounds that are underrepresented
in the biomedical workforce, launching them on a path toward careers in biomedical science and serving the
NIH’s strategic goal of diversifying the biomedical workforce."
10932778,"ICAL ANALYTICAL CORE: SUMMARY
The NIDA Center of Excellence Impact of Cannabinoids Across the Lifespan (ICAL), whose renewal is
proposed in this revised application, tests the hypothesis that non-physiological activation of the
endocannabinoid system during adolescence – caused by exposure to D9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) –
initiates a reprogramming of the genetic and epigenetic processes that govern this system’s molecular
structure, neuroanatomical architecture, and synaptic functions, ultimately producing persistent abnormalities
in cognition and motivated behavior. In the first funding period, which lasted 4 years, the Analytical Core
conducted nine studies which (1) systematically characterized drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic
properties of THC in adolescent and adult mice and rats of both sexes; and (2) provided
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evidence that ICAL’s treatment protocol is a realistic
surrogate for daily cannabis use in teenagers. The studies have produced eight publications and two
articles in preparation. In this resubmission of ICAL’s renewal application, the Analytical Core has two
specific aims. Aim 1: Provide bioanalytical support to ICAL activities. As in the previous funding period, the
Core will continue to fulfill requests for endocannabinoid and THC analysis made by ICAL’s Animal Core,
Projects, pilot grantees, and external collaborators. Aim 2: Develop a novel highly sensitive method for
endocannabinoid analysis and will apply this method to the emerging needs of ICAL’s Projects. The Core will
be directed by Dr. Faizy Ahmed, who has >30 years of experience in analytical chemistry with emphasis on
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). His primary responsibilities will be to: (i)
implement LC-MS/MS methods for the quantification of THC, its metabolites, and endocannabinoid lipids in
tissues; (ii) develop, validate and test an innovative LC-MS/MS assay for the quantification of trace
endocannabinoid lipids in relevant biomaterials; (iii) schedule shared use and maintenance of LC-MS/MS
instrumentation; (iv) supervise a Senior Staff Research Associate responsible for sample preparation; and (v)
train graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in the use of LC-MS/MS equipment for THC and
endocannabinoid analysis."
10932781,"ICAL SYNAPTIC PROJECT (PROJECT 2): SUMMARY
Disturbances in memory associated with cannabis use during adolescence (1-4) strongly suggest that the drug
has age- and sex-specific effects on synaptic plasticity and associated cognitive functions. There is, however,
little information on the neurobiological bases underlying such effects. Our Project has shown that
adolescent THC exposure (‘ado-THC’) causes pronounced, sexually dimorphic, and enduring
impairments to synaptic plasticity underlying learning. Specifically, we found ado-THC leads to marked
deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP) projections to the dentate
gyrus (LPP-LTP) in rodents of both sexes. It also causes enduring deficits in LTP in the CA3 projection
to CA1 (CA1-LTP) but for females only. Importantly, these effects are accompanied by disturbances in
a fundamental aspect of episodic memory known to depend on the LPP. Motivated by evidence that
microglial functions are impaired by ado-THC (Project 1) we tested if these cells normally influence LTP in
hippocampus and found that pharmacological elimination of microglia mimicked the effects of ado-THC on LPP
plasticity and episodic memory but did not impair CA1-LTP. These findings led to a ‘microglia hypothesis’ for
the origin of LPP-LTP and memory problems resulting from ado-THC. The proposed research will test this
hypothesis and evaluate the basis of sex differences in CA1 in three specific aims. Aim 1 will test predictions of
the microglia hypothesis for impairments in LPP plasticity by determining (a) if microglial depletion mimics
effects of ado-THC on synaptic signaling, (b) if newly devised conditional knockout (cKO) mice engineered to
prevent the microglial responses to ado-THC protect LPP-LTP from impairment and (c) if microglial
replacement in adulthood can restore full LPP function after ado-THC. Aim 2 will address the question of why
ado-THC impairs CA1-LTP in females only. It is known that female, but not male, rodents require local
estrogen acting at synaptic estrogen receptors to induce stable CA1-LTP. Preliminary results indicate that ado-
THC blocks estrogen effects on synaptic strength and spine F-actin content in CA1. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that ado-THC disrupts estrogen responsivity at excitatory synapses and specifically impairs
estrogen effects on the actin cytoskeleton that stabilize female CA1-LTP. Finally, Aim 3 will determine the
breadth of ado-THC effects on episodic memory and if these changes are (a) sexually dimorphic and (b)
depend on microglial dysfunction. Together, the studies will identify synaptic mechanisms through which ado-
THC exerts sexually dimorphic effects on episodic memory and, thus, higher cognitive function."

funding, high-impact publications, faculty recruitments, collaborative research and overall capabilities of
Sylvester, a recently NCI-designated cancer center. Dorothy Graves, PhD, Associate Director Administration
and Sylvester Assistant Vice President, leads a dynamic and skilled administrative team that supports the
Cancer Center Director, other Sylvester leadership, and a total of 148 Cancer Center members in their mission
to reduce the human burden of cancer in Sylvester’s diverse South Florida catchment area (CA). SA provides
oversight and management of all research administrative areas and activities through the following specific
aims to: 1) Manage and support all aspects of the CCSG, 2) Facilitate the development and execution of
Sylvester’s five-year SPs, 3) Facilitate collaborative, transdisciplinary, and CA-relevant science across the
Center, 4) Provide effective oversight and management of Sylvester financial resources, space, and facilities
and 5) Advance Sylvester education and training, and community outreach and engagement activities,
supporting the creation of a more diverse workforce. During the reporting period (6/1/18–5/31/23), SA grew
broadly, from 59 to 105 staff, to support the operational, non-clinical research needs of the growing and
maturing cancer center and the needs of the growing community it serves. SA was able to expand its services
and provide Sylvester members with an increasingly robust, cancer-focused infrastructure supporting 44 new
member recruits and an operational budget that grew by 51% during the reporting period. Sylvester members
have garnered $27.9M in peer-reviewed funding, that includes funding from 58 multi-PI grants (as of 5/31/23),
and $12M in NCI research funds. Trainees and early career faculty received 33 training grants, and members
published 1,872 peer-reviewed manuscripts, of which 30% were published in journals with an impact factor
>10. Through the investment of $11.9M in CCSG and Sylvester Developmental Funds, $58.7M in extramural
funding was obtained. SA effectively leverages University of Miami resources such as the Office of Research
Administration, Institutional Review Board, Information Technology, Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and

The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Tumor Biology (TB) Research Program, led by Scott
Welford, PhD, and Priyamvada Rai, PhD, is composed of 36 members in ten departments. The TB program
fosters collaborative, primarily basic mechanistic cancer research, related to Sylvester’s high-priority cancers
and the unmet needs of its four-county catchment area (CA). Over the current reporting period (6/1/2018-
5/31/23), Sylvester has provided significant support for TB program development, including funds for faculty
recruitment, pilot grants, and acquisition of key resources to support transdisciplinary, translational, and team
science. TB members have expertise in studying cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME),
including the signaling pathways that regulate biological stress responses, redox homeostasis, immune
modulation, and inflammation. The program’s primary mission is to understand how tumors arise and progress
and uncover mechanisms underlying chemotherapeutic resistance. To accomplish these goals, TB members
have prioritized three scientific aims, to: 1) elucidate mechanisms underlying tumor initiation; 2) investigate the
underpinnings of tumor progression and drug resistance; and 3) identify and characterize molecular
vulnerabilities in cancer.
The TB program holds a current research funding portfolio of $9.4M in direct peer-reviewed funding, including
$5.1M from the NCI. Since the initial CCSG submission in 2018, program members have published 489 peer-
reviewed, cancer-relevant papers: 23% were intra-programmatic and 30% were inter-programmatic (vs. 21%
and 18%, respectively, in the 2018 submission), 32% were in journals with impact factors ≥10 (vs. 19% in the
2018 submission), and 67% involved collaborations with external institutions. TB members lead four training
grants (three T32s, including renewal of the T32 Research Training Program in Surgical Oncology in 2021, and
one R25). Expertise and services provided by all six Sylvester Shared Resources support TB members’
research. Recent achievements include the discovery of novel roles of both redox response mechanisms and
protein adducts in activating oncogenic transcription networks, which led to a successful NCI P01 grant to
study esophageal adenocarcinoma. Other notable achievements include the identification of AVPR1A, a G
protein-coupled receptor target in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and obesity-induced signaling by the
adipokine chemerin in renal cell cancer development. To advance translational and bench-to-bedside
research, TB members collaborate with colleagues in the Translational and Clinical Oncology (TCO) Research
Program to advance clinical trial development. Thus, TB is a basic science program that capitalizes on
Sylvester’s infrastructure, resources, and environment to advance collaborative, innovative, and CA-relevant

Plan. Targeted faculty recruitment has added expertise in social epidemiology, cancer care delivery, cancer
survivorship, and lifestyle medicine (health behavior) research. The program has achieved key milestones
including receiving a cancer equity T32 training grant, creating a Hispanic/Latino(a) (H/L) cancer survivorship
cohort, and launching several transdisciplinary, multisite, and innovative CA-relevant projects. CC has grown to
include 47 members from four University of Miami Colleges and Schools (Schools of Medicine, Music,
Communications, and the College of Arts and Sciences), representing 12 departments. CC has $7.4M in
annual direct peer-reviewed, cancer-related extramural funding—an increase of over $1M annually since the
prior submission, including $2.9M from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Over the reporting period (6/1/2018-
5/31/2023), program members published 817 peer-reviewed, cancer-relevant papers; 24% (n=200) were intra-
programmatic and 15% (n=126) inter-programmatic, 18% (n=144) were in journals with impact factors ≥10, and
73% (n=599) were published with collaborators from other institutions. Support for faculty recruits totaled
$11.8M and Sylvester Intramural Funding Program (IFP) investments of $2.1M to CC members resulted in
$6.9M of external funding, over a 3-fold return on investment. Grounded in the unique diversity of Sylvester’s
CA, CC has characterized a greater appreciation of the critical heterogeneity of cancer risk, prevalence, and
outcomes in disparate communities (e.g., Caribbean Black, H/Ls) and developed novel interventions that have
led to practice-changing impact across the cancer continuum. Sylvester’s investments in key research
infrastructure, most notably the Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared Resource, and
Sylvester’s Office of Outreach and Engagement ensure input from key community stakeholders to address
community priorities in cancer control. CC continues to develop a highly collaborative and engaged
membership that forms a robust, sustainable, and comprehensive program that advances Sylvester’s mission
among vulnerable racial, ethnic, occupational, and aging populations in SoFL and beyond."
10933321,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE)
Guided by its Strategic Plan, Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) ensures that all its activities
are informed by its defined catchment area (CA), a four-county region (Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe, and
Palm Beach) commonly known as South Florida (SoFL). This area is home to more than 6.2 million people of
diverse ages, ancestry, race/ethnicity, cultural backgrounds, and sexual identities, likely representing the future
demographics of metropolitan areas throughout the US. During the current reporting period (6/1/2018-
5/31/2023), Sylvester has invested significantly in expanding the infrastructure of its Office of Outreach and
Engagement (SOOE), organizing it into three distinct components—outreach, data analytics, and research
support. This structure enhances SOOE’s capacity to facilitate bi-directional engagement between Center
members and diverse community stakeholders, including those who comprise the Center’s Community
Advisory Committee (CAC) (Aim 1). SOOE’s outreach and engagement team expanded its reach by
purchasing two additional Game Changer Vehicles (GCVs), facilitating access to culturally tailored cancer
education, screening, and clinical research participation opportunities beyond Miami-Dade into Broward,
Monroe, and Palm Beach Counties (Aim 2). To maximize these outreach efforts, the SOOE’s data analytics
team has expanded the breadth of SCAN360, the Center’s data visualization platform that empirically identifies
the distribution of cancer risk and outcomes throughout the CA by incorporating ten new secondary datasets
on multilevel cancer risk factors (Aim 3). SOOE also established a Research Support team to match faculty
and trainees with interested community partners to maximize bi-directionality across Sylvester’s research
portfolio. Such efforts are enhanced by the Center’s COE Advocates (12) and Clinical Trial Champions (17),
who participate in Sylvester’s four Research Programs or Site Disease Groups/Clinical Research Teams,
respectively, and ensure that CA needs are understood by all members and are a focus of research from
bench to bedside or community, and back (Aim 4). As a result of all such efforts, two-thirds of Sylvester’s
funded research portfolio can be characterized as CA-relevant using an algorithm developed by SOOE in
collaboration with the Center’s research leadership. SOOE also works closely with the Center’s Office of
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Office of Education and Training, and Clinical Research Services to maximize
shared goals, including growing a diverse research workforce with the ability to shape statewide cancer health
policy, support global oncology initiatives, and advance Sylvester’s and the NCI’s commitment to health equity
in SoFL and beyond (Aim 5)."
10933322,"PROJECT SUMMARY: DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
Developmental Funds, derived from a variety of sources (CCSG, state, institutional, and philanthropy),
advance the mission, goals, and scientific activities of Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester)
through the support of innovative, collaborative, programmatic, and catchment area (CA) relevant science.
Guided by Sylvester’s Strategic Plan, the internally peer-reviewed Intramural Funding Program (IFP) utilizes
Developmental Funds to catalyze collaborative research and support promising ideas and investigators,
targeting specific areas of research priority, including transdisciplinary or translational science, community
outreach and engagement, and innovative clinical trials through a variety of pilot and non-pilot funding
mechanisms. Working closely with Sylvester Administration, the Deputy Director leads the IFP program to
execute a rigorous process for solicitation of funding opportunities, review of applications, awarding of funds,
and tracking of progress. IFP administration also oversees the American Cancer Society Institutional Research
Grant awards, leveraging these funds with additional institutional dollars, and the multi-center collaborative
Florida Academic Cancer Center Alliance pilot awards, conducted in partnership with Florida’s NCI-designated
cancer centers. Sylvester’s Scientific Steering and Executive Committees review and approve the priority
funding strategies each year, and over time, the IFP has offered 13 strategically-aligned funding mechanisms.
CCSG Developmental Funds specifically supported emerging scientific ideas through Transdisciplinary
Science Pilot awards and Translational Science Pilot Awards. $1.1M of CCSG Developmental Funds was
committed to support 12 projects, which have thus far resulted in $3.4M in extramural funding, yielding a return
on investment (ROI) of 3.1-fold. Combined CCSG and Sylvester Developmental Fund investments of $11.9M
into 111 research projects, during the reporting period, resulted in $58.7M in total awarded extramural research
awards (ROI = 4.9), 82 peer-reviewed publications, and 82 clinical trial accruals as of 5/31/23. During the
reporting period, $551,216 of CCSG Developmental Funds supported the development of three Shared
Resources (SRs), two of which are proposed as CCSG-supported SRs in this application. In the next funding
period, to support Sylvester’s CA-aligned research priorities, and its growth and maturation as an NCI-
designated cancer center, Developmental Funds will be used according to the following specific aims, to: 1)
Support transdisciplinary, translational and team science through pilot funding mechanisms that promote
innovative and collaborative research that impacts Sylvester’s CA and leads to extramural funding ($750K
CCSG investment), 2) Support innovative cancer research conducted by underrepresented minority
investigators through a dedicated early career pilot award program ($250K CCSG investment), and 3) Recruit
additional outstanding cancer researchers to enhance Sylvester’s Research Programs, promote team science,
target priority cancers, and further address the needs of Sylvester’s CA ($750K CCSG investment)."
10939723,"Project Summary- Genomics Core
Genomic technologies have broadly impacted vision science and have a critical role in many of the
research programs carried out at Mass Eye and Ear. The Genomics core provides access to state-of-
the-art genomic resources. Direct access to the Genomics core resources and expertise makes it
possible for investigators to efficiently obtain high-quality data and eliminates the long queues for
services such as next-generation sequencing frequently experienced at off-site centers. Importantly,
the expert Genomics core personnel can help investigators plan appropriate experiments and assist
with analyses (including troubleshooting)-services that would not be readily available elsewhere. The
efficient timeline for data acquisition increases the overall productivity of the core investigators as well
as improves the quality of the research. The Genomics core personnel are experts in the genetics
and genomics of eye disease, creating opportunities for collaboration among investigators using this
resource. Overall direct access to Genomics core personnel and resources greatly enhances the
quality of the research and ultimate accomplishments of the core investigators. The Genomics core is
directed by Dr. Eric Pierce, an expert in the genetics and genomics of inherited ocular disease.
Services provided by the Genomics core includes: Sanger sequencing, whole exome sequencing,
selective exon capture and next generation sequencing (NGS) for ocular disease genes (GEDi test),
array genotyping, whole genome sequencing, copy number variation (CNV) and RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq)."
10940228,"Project Summary
Pharmacological probes are widely used to study the nervous system. Despite often exhibiting exquisite
specificity for target receptors, due to diffusion, traditional small molecule drugs act slowly and with spatial
imprecision. This impedes neuropharmacological studies in vivo, particularly those involving high resolution
electrophysiological, imaging, and behavioral tracking methods. Such studies greatly benefit from the ability to
correlate measurements with well defined, time-locked stimuli that can be readily varied in intensity and
duration. To meet this need, we are developing “caged” drugs that can be applied systemically in an inactive
form and subsequently released in the brain with high spatial and temporal precision using short light flashes.
To enable compatibility with optical measurements of neural function involving fluorescent probes, we will
develop new photochemical protecting groups that are wavelength tuned to be spectrally orthogonal to
common green and red fluorophores, in terms of both one-photon and two-photon excitation. We will further
optimize these “caging” groups to facilitate brain penetrance of the resulting caged drugs. We will evaluate the
utility of new caging groups by incorporating them into 2nd generation caged opioid drugs that should provide
significant experimental advantages over our 1st generation variants, which could only be photoactivated with
ultraviolet light. We will rigorously validate new caged opioid drugs using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo
experimental paradigms, culminating in behavioral assays and fiber photometry recordings of opioid-evoked
neurochemical signaling. In addition, we will develop caged ketamine derivatives that can be used to study the
neural mechanisms underlying dissociative states, as well as ketamine’s rapid antidepressant actions. Caged
ketamine variants will also be evaluated using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental paradigms, including
measurements of spinogenesis and neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. These efforts will involve
development of an optical configuration for simultaneous two photon imaging and one photon photolysis
through implanted prisms. To maximize end-user uptake, performance criteria for both caged drug families are
determined through extensive consultation with the scientific community."
10940248,"Abstract
 This administrative supplement proposal aims to uncover a novel compensatory neuroprotective mechanism
of prokineticin 2 (PK2) signaling within the context of environmentally linked Alzheimer's disease-related
dementia (ADRD). ADRD represents a significant subset of dementia conditions, primarily characterized by the
presence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in the brain, including a range of cognitive impairments, memory
deficits, and behavioral changes that affect daily life and functioning. AD, the most common form of dementia, is
characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, abnormal tau protein tangles, chronic
neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and synaptic disruption. These pathological changes contribute to cognitive
decline, memory loss, and behavioral symptoms in AD patients. The olfactory system is closely connected to
brain regions involved in memory and cognition, and growing evidence indicates that olfactory dysfunction often
occurs in the early stages of AD, frequently even preceding cognitive symptoms. Exposure to the environmental
metal manganese (Mn) has also garnered attention in the context of AD/ADRD research. Chronic exposure to
high levels of Mn, often associated with occupational settings, has been linked to olfactory dysfunction, cognitive
impairment, and neurological symptoms reminiscent of AD. Despite the established link between olfactory
dysfunction and memory-cognitive impairments, the exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the
compromised olfaction and cognition in environmentally linked AD have not been fully elucidated. As outlined in
our parent R01 proposal, we recently reported rapid upregulation of the neuropeptide prokineticin 2 (PK2) during
early-stage Mn neurotoxicity, serving as a compensatory response to protect against neurodegeneration through
pro-survival pathways. Additionally, our preliminary findings demonstrate that stimulating PK2 signaling led to a
significant increase in glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression and release from astrocytes. Thus,
we hypothesize that cognitive deficits, impaired OB function, and Aβ/tau pathology in AD may result from reduced
PK2-GDNF-mediated compensatory signaling in the brain. Additionally, chronic Mn exposure may further deplete
brain PK2-GDNF signaling, thereby intensifying ADRD-related pathology. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue
the following specific aims: (i) Map the spatial and temporal expression of PK2-GDNF and their receptors across
the cortex, hippocampus, OB, and basal ganglia regions, and establish functional correlations with region-
specific neuronal susceptibility, the accumulation of Aβ/tau pathology, olfactory dysfunction, and cognitive
deficits in the HTAP mouse model of AD; and (ii) Examine whether chronic exposure to Mn amplifies the
depletion of hippocampal PK2-GDNF protective signaling, consequently exacerbating disease progression in
HTAP mice. Overall, we predict that our proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into metal-
induced olfactory and cognitive dysfunction and its role in the pathogenesis of environmentally linked ADRD and
will offer a novel therapeutic strategy."
10939436,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This 5-year effort titled “Leveraging a Regional Clinical Practice Research Network for Health Equity in the Rural,
Border Region of Imperial County, California (Imperial County Clinical Research Network)” seeks to advance
minority health and health disparities research by establishing the personnel and systems (policies and
procedures) infrastructure to support clinical research within a regional medical center that serves a rural, border
community in Southern California. It accomplishes this by bringing together three primary organizations and their
respective leaders to develop a disease-agnostic research agenda consistent with the needs of patients, diverse
clinicians and multi-sectoral community stakeholders. Infrastructure will be developed to support both
observational (e.g., cohort studies; secondary analyses using electronic medical record [EMR] data) and
intervention (from efficacy to effectiveness trials) research. During the UG3 phase, we propose to develop the
research infrastructure to support the implementation of a pragmatic trial as this provides the strongest possible
infrastructure for supporting PP2, which will be determined through a competitive process. The UG3 phase also
will advance data sharing activities including identifying a set of common data elements across Network sites,
and developing and testing protocols and systems for sharing data, including EMR data from multiple systems.
During the UH3 phase (Y3-5), both PPs will be launched following final approval from the Multidisciplinary
Research Council and the SDSU IRB committee. PP1 proposes to test a robust Lactation Support Program to
promote engagement in prenatal care and exclusive breastfeeding to ultimately reduce the rates of childhood
overweight and obesity in Imperial County. The UH3 phase will continue to advance data sharing and promote
dissemination through the development of protocols and systems for data verification, data harmonization, and
meaningful interpretation of data given contextual factors (e.g., language of administration). The proposed
timeline plans for data sharing and harmonization to occur with the PPs as early as possible (here in Y3), and
with sufficient time at the end to complete final follow-up data collection from participants, and data submitted to
the Coordinating Center in Y5. All of these efforts will be guided by the involvement of a Patient Advisory
Committee (5 members), a Clinician Advisory Committee (15 diverse clinician types), and a Community
Stakeholder Committee (12 diverse sector members). The ultimate goal of this effort is to identify feasible,
sustainable, and translatable approaches to promote health and well-being in rural, border communities."
10912670,"The overall goal of the research in my lab is to define the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences
of cellular mechanotransduction – or how cells sense the mechanical properties of their microenvironment and
launch appropriate functional responses. Cell-cell interactions, mediated by adhesion and signaling receptors,
are highly dynamic and subject to cytoskeletal movements that impart substantial mechanical force at the
interface. How cells combine mechanical and biochemical signals to carry out specific functions is not well
understood. Our lab tackles this question in two contexts – the immune response in T cells and regulation of
gene expression - using a combination of high (and super)-resolution imaging, force measurements,
quantitative image analysis, genomics and mathematical modeling. As part of our NIGMS-funded research, we
have recently demonstrated that T cell activation requires a close coordination of the actin and microtubule
cytoskeletons in order to generate forces at the T cell receptor, which are transduced to biochemical signaling
leading to T cell activation. We have shown that cytokine stimulation leads to modulation of cytoskeletal
dynamics and force generation in cytotoxic T cells, facilitating the cytolytic response. We have also developed
new methods for analysis of single molecule tracking data, which we have applied to study the dynamics and
binding kinetics of transcription factors and relate them to genome-wide measurements. Over the next five
years, we plan to continue to address the molecular mechanisms that mediate actin/microtubule crosstalk in T
cells for the control of RhoA-mediated forces and how these cytoskeletal forces tune the mechanical
coordination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activation and their efficacy in killing cancer cells. Taking advantage of
the flexible nature of the R35 funding mechanism, we will establish a new line of research that builds on our
technological capabilities to examine how mechanical cues are relayed to the nucleus to regulate gene
expression in a functionally appropriate manner and how mechanical cues interact with tissue-specific cues.
We will use advanced tools for real-time visualization of nuclear hormone receptor and target gene
transcription dynamics to interrogate 1) how substrate stiffness regulates chromatin accessibility and
modulates the mobility of transcription factors and co-activators, with a particular focus on nuclear hormone
receptors and 2) how biophysical mechanisms transduce changes in the mechanical environment into
alterations in gene expression dynamics. Our research program will 1) elucidate how mechanical stimuli and
biochemical signaling are coupled to orchestrate the adaptive immune response and 2) enable fundamental
understanding of how mechanical properties of the microenvironment modulate gene expression, with
implications for designing new targets for intervention in immune therapy and breast cancer."

A group of devastating diseases, collectively termed synucleinopathies, affect over 2 million people in the U.S.,
carry significant morbidity, high mortality and enormous associated health care costs. Synucleinopathies are
characterized by the abnormal deposition of a misfolded protein, phosphorylated α−synuclein (P-SYN), within
the central and peripheral nervous systems. Synucleinopathies include Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PAF) differ in clinical symptoms
and disease progression rates. Currently, no disease modifying therapies exist for any of the synucleinopathies.
Deposition of P-SYN within the cutaneous (skin) nerve fibers of synucleinopathy patients provides diagnostic
clarity and increases with disease progression. Importantly, cutaneous deposition of P-SYN is also observed in
the majority of patients diagnosed with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), a prodro-
mal synucleinopathy in which >90% of patients phenoconvert to clinically apparent synucleinopathy within 15
years of diagnosis. At present, methods for determining the disease trajectory of clinically apparent synucle-
inopathy in patients with iRBD do not exist. Diagnostic tools able to evaluate and reliably predict the probability
of phenoconversion at prodromal stages is an urgent and unmet need with clinical importance and public health
implications at a global scale. Cutaneous Neurodiagnostics (CND Life Sciences), a CLIA-certified laboratory,
has developed its core enabling technology of detecting P-SYN in small (3 mm) patients’ punch skin biopsies
and launched the first commercially available diagnostic test for synucleinopathy, the Syn-One Test™. In this
Direct to Phase II study, CND Life Sciences will advance the Syn-One Test™ through detection of P-SYN
in iRBD patients to predict phenoconversion risk and accelerate the commercial viability of testing
through an innovative AI-powered augmented pathological interpretation of the results. To achieve this
objective, CND Life Sciences has conducted feasibility studies to demonstrate that cutaneous P-SYN deposition
can be reliably detected in 94-100% of synucleinopathy patients and in none of the disease control subjects,
while preliminary pilot studies showed that P-SYN is observed in 64% of iRBD patients. In this proposal, CND
Life Sciences will collaborate with the North American Prodromal Synucleinopathy (NAPS) consortium (an NIH-
funded project) to 1) define the metrics of P-SYN deposition and nerve fiber degeneration that predict pheno-
conversion in iRBD patients (Aim 1) and 2) enhance pathological reading through digital quantitative analysis of
the Syn-One Test™ using an AI-augmented detection system (Aim 2). Successful completion of this study will
advance the clinical utility of the Syn-One Test™, improving patient care, increasing the commercial potential of
the product, and ultimately accelerating the development of disease-modifying therapies."

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) co-occurs frequently with hazardous alcohol outcomes, presenting
considerable public health burdens and challenging traditional treatment approaches. Although accessible
interventions able to adapt to individuals’ fluctuating internal risks within their natural environments are
emerging, these just-in-time adaptive interventions have largely not yet considered the role of trauma sequalae
in alcohol use. To do so, research needs to identify the acute risks for drinking operating in-the-moment as
individuals experience PTSD symptoms in their daily lives. There is a critical need to define and operationalize
acute cognitive processes underlying PTSD-related drinking (Aim 1), examine variability in such cognitions
amid PTSD symptoms in real-world settings (Aim 2), and establish which of these acute cognitions are linked
to actual drinking events and mediate PTSD-related drinking (Aim 3). During the K99 phase, Aim 1 comprises
a fine-grained qualitative examination into acute risk cognitions among frequent drinkers with PTSD, utilizing
focus groups to identify key acute cognitions and cognitive interviewing approaches to operationalize
measures of such cognitions. Aim 2 field-tests these cognitive assessments by examining whether they vary
across drinkers’ daily lives and are active amid PTSD symptoms within a 14-day ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) study. During the R00 phase, Aim 3 considerably extends such work to test whether these
acute cognitions are linked to actual drinking events as well as whether they are mechanisms of PTSD-related
drinking across another 14-day EMA. Collectively, this mixed methods investigation will identify proximal
cognitive mechanisms of PTSD-related drinking that can be targeted in future just-in-time interventions. As a
K99/R00 NIH Pathway to Independence Award, these research efforts would support the emergence of a
dedicated early career researcher (Dr. Zaso) with unique expertise in acute cognitive trauma-related drinking
processes. This K99/R00 also would afford Dr. Zaso instrumental development in acute PTSD-related drinking
processes, momentary assessment of affective alcohol cognitions, and the methodological/statistical
techniques necessary to characterize momentary, real-world drinking processes. The mentorship team offers
expertise in the intersection of trauma and alcohol use (Dr. Jennifer Read), with collaboration support on daily
processes in PTSD-related drinking (Dr. Tracy Simpson), acute activation of alcohol cognitions (Dr. Robert
Dvorak), optimization of mobile alcohol assessment and intervention (Dr. Tammy Chung), and statistical
modeling of multilevel alcohol etiologies (Dr. Craig Colder). Dr. Zaso’s career development will occur within
the Department of Psychology and Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions at the University at Buffalo,
which comprise a rich intellectual environment with a network of productive addictions researchers. Overall,
this K99/R00 will propel Dr. Zaso’s emergence as an independent trauma-related alcohol researcher with the
skills necessary to maintain a clinically impactful research program aimed at curtailing alcohol harms."

Mammalian prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Chronic Wasting Disease
(CWD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and scrapie, are a group of infectious
neurodegenerative disorders caused by the autocatalytic conversion of the host-encoded prion
protein, PrPC, into a group of misfolded, infectious conformers collectively termed PrPSc.
Multiple lines of evidence from biochemical, genetic, and cell biological studies suggest that
PrPC and PrPSc employ specific pathways for biosynthesis, trafficking, and degradation in living
cells. However, full elucidation of these pathways has been hindered the lack of tractable model
organisms for genetic screening. To overcome this obstacle, we recently developed methods to
detect both PrPC and PrPSc in brain-derived CAD5 cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). We will use these sensitive sorting methods to perform CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 whole genome library screens in CAD5 cells
infected with different prion strains. These studies will be the first to fully map the molecular
pathways that control the biosynthesis, trafficking, and degradation of both PrPC and PrPSc
molecules, and thereby greatly advance our fundamental knowledge of prion cell biology. Our
unbiased screens will also reveal the rate limiting steps of prion formation and clearance,
thereby identifying the most susceptible targets for drug therapy."
11132565,"The goal of newborn screening is to detect potentially fatal or disabling conditions in newborns, thereby providing a window of opportunity for early treatment, often while the child is still asymptomatic. Such early detection and treatment can have a profound impact on the clinical severity of the condition in the affected child. If left undiagnosed and untreated, the consequences of the targeted disorders can be dire, many causing irreversible neurological damage, intellectual, developmental, and physical disabilities, and even death. In 2006, the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) developed newborn screening guidelines that recommend that all newborn infants be screened for 29 ""core conditions"" and that 25 secondary conditions identified during the core evaluations be reported. These recommendations have been accepted by the HHS Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) (authorized by the Children's Health Act of 2000), and by the Secretary of HHS. Most states now use this or very similar panels for newborn screening. Currently, there are thousands of rare disorders that have been identified and hundreds that could potentially benefit from newborn screening. 
It has become evident, however, that a major impediment to implementing new technologies in high throughput newborn screening laboratories is the ability to provide evidence of the feasibility of the assay, both scientifically and logistically, in a timely manner. A majority of disorders considered for newborn screening are rare diseases where the likelihood of detecting cases during standard newborn screening in a single laboratory is very low. For this reason, collaborative efforts, implemented across multiple states or newborn screening laboratories, are necessary for the successful development and implementation of new assays and the addition of new conditions to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP)."

 Recent evidence suggests disruption of GABAergic inhibitory function as a likely mechanism underlying
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In order to function correctly, neural networks must establish precise and
stable interconnected circuits. Synaptic refinement mediated by GABAergic inhibitory neurons during
development is necessary for the precision of brain function, and thus, developmental disruption of GABAergic
inhibitory neurons (also known as interneurons) has the potential to perturb fundamental cortical functions, such
as accurate encoding of sensory information and higher-order cognition. One major challenge in exploring
GABAergic dysfunction is the diversity of inhibitory interneurons, which can be subdivided into distinct classes
with different physiology, synaptic targets, and molecular markers. In the cortex, the largest interneuron class is
comprised of fast-spiking basket cells that express parvalbumin (PV) and target the cell bodies of excitatory
neurons, providing rapid, powerful inhibition. Dysregulation of PV-interneurons has been suggested as a
candidate mechanism underlying autism, but little is known about the mechanistic contribution of PV-
interneurons to ASD-related deficits. Selective disruption of PV-interneuron function in the context of ASD in will
provide novel insight into specific GABAergic regulation and dysfunction in ASD.
 Genetic studies of ASD patients have identified Mef2c as a candidate gene. Small de novo deletions in
the Mef2c locus, as well as missense mutations, have been reported in several unrelated patients with autistic
features. Mef2c is an activity-dependent transcription that plays a role in synaptic function, and an
haploinsufficiency mouse model of Mef2c result in behavioral phenotypes characteristic of ASD. The
convergence of human studies, Mef2c function, and the ASD-like behaviors phenotypes present in the Mef2c
haploinsufficiency mouse model makes Mef2c an excellent candidate gene for addressing the molecular, cellular
and circuit dysfunctions underlying altered behavior in ASD. Mef2c is expressed in cortical excitatory neurons
and PV-interneurons, however thus far the cell type-specific role of Mef2c for PV-interneuron function and its
relation to ASDs remains unknown. Here, we will use combination of approaches that includes mouse genetics,
behavior, histology, synaptic physiology, in vivo electrophysiology, and transcriptomic analyses to test the
hypotheses that Mef2c signaling shapes PV-interneuron development, and that age-specific Mef2c-related
disruptions of PV-interneurons will impair different aspects of synaptic transmission and cortical activity, gaining
mechanistic insights into how impaired PV-interneuron dysfunction can contribute towards ASD symptoms."
10914663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Unhealthy alcohol use, common among persons with (PWH) and at risk for HIV, is associated with multiple
deleterious effects that increase the risk of HIV transmission. However, identifying individuals with unhealthy
alcohol use in practice remains challenging because self-report consistently underrepresents true alcohol
consumption. An objective measure of alcohol use, with clearly defined associations with clinical outcomes
relevant for HIV prevention and transmission, would eliminate the time and resources dedicated to trying to
subjectively quantify alcohol use, and would instead direct efforts towards swift and effective clinical
interventions. Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) holds tremendous untapped potential as an objective, quantitative
alcohol biomarker that could fill this unmet need. However, PEth has primarily been used in a qualitative and
inconsistent manner which complicates interpretation and hinders actionable interventions. PEth's application
to HIV prevention and treatment is also limited, especially with contemporary HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) with injectable long-acting agents such as cabotegravir (CAB-LA) and
cabotegravir/rilpivirine (CAB/RPV-LA). Delays in PEth concentration results in practice also impedes real-time
interventions. This proposal will address these significant knowledge gaps and is directly responsive to RFA-
AA-21-016. The long-term objective of this work is to advance PEth as an objective and actionable alcohol
biomarker for HIV prevention and treatment. This will be accomplished as follows: Aim 1. Establish the
relationship between PEth concentrations, PrEP adherence, and HIV acquisition among persons at risk
for HIV. Using a seminal PrEP trial, HPTN-083, which compared CAB-LA vs. emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil
fumarate (F/TDF) for HIV prevention in men and transgender women who have sex with men, the relationship
between PEth and (1) time to drop-out, (2) time between cabotegravir/placebo injections, (3) intracellular
tenofovir-diphosphate concentrations (an objective PrEP adherence biomarker) and (4) the risk of acquiring
HIV will be established. Aim 2. Determine the ability of PEth to predict the undetectable=untransmissible
(U=U) threshold among PWH with adherence barriers. To prevent HIV transmission and end the epidemic,
suppression of viral replication to <200 copies/mL among PWH is essential. ACTG A5359 is a trial comparing
CAB/RPV-LA vs. oral ART in PWH with a history of non-adherence to ART. A5359 includes a 12-24 week oral
ART induction period with economic incentives (Step 1), followed by randomization to continued oral ART vs.
monthly CAB/RPV-LA injections for 52 weeks (Step 2). The primary objective is to determine the ability of PEth
in Step 1 to predict failure to achieve the U=U threshold in Steps 1 and 2. Aim 3. Develop a point-of-care test
for PEth in whole blood. Using a commercially available miniature mass spectrometer, a point-of-care test
will be developed for PEth. Immediate identification of unhealthy alcohol use will greatly accelerate clinical
interventions and prevent deleterious clinical outcomes in persons at risk for HIV, PWH, and beyond."

Education is a critical social determinant of health (SDOH). Low-income, Latino dual language learners face
large gaps in school readiness, which perpetuate inequities in academic achievement and subsequent health.
Primary care is an ideal setting to promote school readiness for at-risk children given its frequent near
universal contact with children and the opportunity to build on established relationships with their families. In
fact, school readiness is a Bright Futures priority topic at the 4 and 5-year well child visits. However, the current
structure of well child visits, which seeks to address a growing list of topics during 10-15 minute appointments,
is limited in its ability to achieve this goal. To date, primary care innovations to address SDOH have largely
missed an opportunity to promote 360-degree child health by simultaneously addressing academic and
physical readiness for school. To address this gap, we developed an online family wellness program that uses
anticipatory guidance on health topics intrinsically important to school readiness (e.g., nutrition, physical
activity) to introduce basic language and literacy skills to low-income, Latino dual language learners, a fast-
growing and particularly high-risk group, and their families (AHRQ priority populations). The online family
wellness program was developed through a cross-sector partnership between educators and pediatric
professionals and consists of parent-child workshops led by bilingual educators and reminder text messages.
The program occurs during the transition into Kindergarten, a critical developmental stage, and uses promising
approaches such as group structure, strategic use of technology, and partnerships with non- medical
professionals. The yearlong program tightly integrates Bright Futures anticipatory guidance with the
Kindergarten curriculum. During pilot testing, our team found that the family wellness program was feasible,
well attended, and highly acceptable. We now propose testing the effect of the family wellness program on
child and parenting outcomes using a rigorous mixed methods and community-engaged approach. In aim 1,
we will conduct a developmental evaluation to refine the family wellness program and optimize the likelihood of
successful implementation. In aim 2, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial testing the effects of the
family wellness program on child language, literacy, and social-emotional outcomes as well parent health
routines, learning activities, and self-efficacy. In aim 3, we will conduct a mixed methods process evaluation,
which will provide insight into reach and implementation as well as user experience. The current proposal will
yield insight into how primary care innovations can address education, which responds directly to AHRQ's
interest in primary care innovations that address SDOH (NOT-HS-19-011). If effective, the online format will
allow us to work with local, state, and national partners to disseminate the program rapidly to promote high-
quality healthcare for vulnerable populations."

Young people living with HIV (Y-PLWH) have poor adherence to antiretroviral therapy and engagement in HIV
care, making HIV the leading cause of death for African adolescents. Depression and psychological distress
are much more common among Y-PLWH than in the general population, and are associated with significantly
worse adherence to care and treatment when compared to Y-PLWH without these co-morbid conditions.
Thus, untreated depression and severe psychological distress are important contributors to poor HIV outcomes
in this population. Nigeria is home to the 4th largest HIV population globally and 10% of Y-PLWH, but mental
health screening is not routinely conducted in this setting, and less than 10% of those diagnosed have access
to evidence-based care. Despite this treatment gap, few interventions have targeted the mental health needs
of Y-PLWH in Africa. The World Health Organization recommends that caregivers of Y-PLWH adopt youth-
friendly strategies and incorporate psychosocial services to meet their needs, and that task shifting to non-
specialized health workers be used to overcome the dearth of trained professionals in low and middle-income
countries. Task-shifted problem Solving Therapy (PST) has been effectively used by our team and others to
treat both depression and psychological distress using a task-shifted approach. However, PST is an intensive
strategy (typically 6-15 weekly sessions) often delivered in-person and poor completion rates are associated
with less effectiveness -- a concern further magnified during the current COVID-19 climate. Mobile health
technologies may be uniquely suited to surmount some of the obstacles for effective PST delivery in Nigeria
and novel digital game-based strategies, can be utilized to promote engagement in mental health interventions
on a platform that is compelling for young people. Our team has developed, a preliminary prototype of a
theory-grounded game, Change My Story, in which players navigate difficult experiences based on drivers of
psychological distress and interact with a virtual environment to choose a narrative path toward the story's
conclusion. In this proposal, we will finalize the prototype of Change My Story, and integrate this game into a
comprehensive, task-shifted PST intervention delivered via mobile phone to optimize engagement in mental
health care. Through the R21 mechanism, we aim to: 1) finalize the Change My Story prototype to address key
drivers of psychological distress among Y-PLWH in Nigeria and 2) establish the usability, feasibility, and
acceptability of Change My Story among Y-PLWH with psychological distress in Nigeria. Through the R33
mechanism, we aim to 1) conduct a hybrid implementation-effectiveness pilot RCT for 80 Y-PLWH with
depression or psychological distress, and compare feasibility, acceptability, engagement, satisfaction and
preliminary effectiveness among individuals receiving PST alone or PST with Change My Story, and 2) use the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to assess factors influencing engagement,
acceptability, and satisfaction along with facilitators and barriers to implementation delivery."

Determining accurate models of the developing brain’s functional architecture during the first two
years of life has potential prognostic value for maturation milestones and the onset of
psychopathology. A growing body of literature suggests that infant and toddler brain functional
connectivity (FC) networks (as defined using functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) are
less mature than adult networks. However, there are two distinct and potentially interacting factors
present when estimating infant and toddler FC: 1) age and 2) state. Critically, infant and toddler
fMRI data are collected during natural sleep, while fMRI data in older populations are typically
collected during resting wakefulness. Research suggests that pediatric FC estimated from
sleeping state fMRI appears more similar to adult sleeping state networks (SSN) than awake adult
resting state networks. However, even within pediatric FC studies, comparisons regarding age
are compounded by developmental differences in state as time spent in different sleep stages
changes over the first two years of life. Crucially, individual variability in time spent in each sleep
stage poses a challenge for reproducibility and prediction accuracy of extant pediatric, sleeping
state fMRI studies such as the Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding (eLABE) study, Baby
Connectome Project (BCP), Developing Human Connectome Project, and the Healthy Brain and
Child Development Study. The overarching goals of this Award are to 1) disentangle the relative
contributions of sleep stage and age in early brain network development and 2) decode sleep
stages in extant infant and toddler sleeping state fMRI. Completion of these goals will enable age
and state-specific FC prediction of mental health and clinical outcomes. Towards these goals,
infant and toddler sleep stages and FC networks will be characterized using concurrent
electroencephalogram (EEG) - fMRI. Aim 1 will optimize pediatric EEG-fMRI acquisition and
analysis. Aim 2 will determine pediatric FC SSN development by collecting cross-sectional EEG-
fMRI data from 50 children at birth and 24 months of age. Aim 3 will decode sleep stages in out
of sample fMRI data (eLABE & BCP). While EEG-fMRI in infants and toddlers is an ambitious and
new research direction for the PI, our investigative team has the necessary expertise for success,
including FC brain network analysis (PI: Wheelock), pediatric fMRI acquisition and analysis
(Smyser), concurrent EEG-fMRI acquisition and analysis (Zempel, Palanca), pediatric EEG sleep
staging (Rudock), and machine learning (Lahiri). The knowledge generated from this R01 will be
transformative, providing a state-based understanding of early developmental brain networks and
a framework for accurate developmental outcome predictions."

Bacterial pathogens require specific adaptations to survive and thrive in their replicative niche. A subset of
important human pathogens, including Shigella Spp. Rickettsia spp and Burkholderia spp., utilize the cytosol of
host cells as their primary replication niche. Although the host cell cytosol is an inhospitable environment for
bacteria, the stresses encountered in this environment and the mechanisms pathogens utilize to overcome these
stresses are not well understood. The goal of this proposal is to utilize the cytosolic pathogen Listeria
monocytogenes (Lm) to understand how host cells recognize and respond to bacteria in the cytosol and
in turn how cytosolic pathogens have adapted to life in the cytosol.
Lm is a Gram positive foodborne pathogen that causes the rare but often fatal disease Listeriosis. To identify
mechanisms by which Lm has adapted to survive and thrive in the mammalian cytosol, we have utilized a series
of forward genetic screens to identify genes required for Lm cytosolic survival. These screens highlighted robust
cell wall stress responses and specific metabolic adaptations as essential for cytosolic survival and virulence.
Specifically, we demonstrated that the PASTA kinase PrkA is a master regulator of cell wall stress responses
essential for cytosolic survival and virulence in vivo. We defined the phosphoproteome of PrkA and defined the
role of one phosphosubstrate, ReoM, in regulating peptidoglycan synthesis in response to cell wall stress during
infection. GlmR is another PrkA substrate required for cell wall stress responses, cytosolic survival and virulence
in vivo and we defined its role as an accessory uridyltransferase. Finally, an additional gene of unknown function,
yvcJ, was identified through our genetic screens and shown to be involved in cell wall stress responses, cytosolic
survival and virulence. How the remaining PrkA dependent phosphoproteins coordinate cell wall stress
responses, how phosphorylation of GlmR regulates its function, how YvcJ contributes to cell wall stress
responses and finally the mechanism by which the host imparts cell wall stress on bacteria in the cytosol are all
unknown. These questions are the focus of Aim 1.
Our cytosolic survival screens also revealed multiple genes involved in central metabolism, notably the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex and genes required for DHNA biosynthesis. Mutants lacking these pathways secrete
lactate instead of acetate as the major metabolic byproduct and interventions that restore acetate production
rescue cytosolic survival of DHNA deficient strains. Additionally, we created a series of mutants missing genes
essential for Lm glycerol utilization, hexose phosphate utilization, or both. As the only described carbon sources
utilized by Lm during infection we were surprised to find minimal defects in ex vivo virulence and only 1-2 log
reductions in virulence in mice. How increased concentrations of cytosolic lactate during Lm infection alter host
responses, what other carbon sources are used by Lm during infection and how alterations in bacterial carbon
utilization impact host responses are currently unknown. These questions are the focus of Aim 2."

Weight stigma is a modifiable risk factor that negatively impacts the health and well-being of higher-weight
people and those with lower BMI who simply perceive themselves as heavy. Weight stigma leads to poorer
health outcomes due to stress processes, lower quality healthcare provision, and healthcare avoidance by
patients to avoid stigma. Psychologists play a large role in behavioral health programs, as well as care for
eating disorders, body dysmorphia, and other conditions that make it essential that they are able to
effectively communicate with higher-weight people in a non-stigmatizing way. Weight stigma is a major risk
factor for psychological disorders and weight stigma is prevalent among mental healthcare providers.
Evidence from studies in medical education suggest that training in healthcare disciplines may reinforce
and increase weight stigma. It is necessary to provide training to future clinical psychologists in patient -
centered communication strategies about body image, weight, weight-inclusive care, and to eliminate
common weight-related biases and stereotypes that will affect care quality. Although clinical psychologists
play an important role in healthcare, it is not known how weight stigma changes during training, if doctoral
training perpetuates weight stigma over time, and if theoretically- and empirically-supported mechanisms
underlying the development of weight stigma apply in clinical psychology settings. The long-term goal of
the proposed research is to examine changes in weight stigma among psychology trainees during four
years of doctoral clinical training. The aims of this study are to 1) establish whether weight stigma changes
as a function of time in doctoral clinical psychology training and 2) identify mechanisms underlying the
development of weight stigma during doctoral clinical training. Given that weight stigma is rarely
addressed in clinical psychology training programs, it is hypothesized that weight stigma will intensify
during time in clinical training. In addition, it is hypothesized that weight controllability beliefs, quality of
intergroup contact with higher-weight people, and perceived social acceptability of weight stigma will
mediate the effect of time in clinical training on weight stigma. This study will use a prospective cohort
longitudinal design and online survey methodology collecting four waves of data across four years of
training from students enrolled in APA-accredited doctoral clinical psychology programs. Longitudinal
mediation methods will be used to examine how processes unfold over time and the temporal order of
events. The proposed research will yield novel insights to inform more effective weight stigma reduction
interventions and the development of training competencies to address weight stigma and provide weight-
inclusive healthcare training. This project will provide the foundation from which to comprehensively
address a long-standing call to increase preparedness of future mental health professionals and improve
the quality of care for people of all sizes."
10936213,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic stressors, such as racial discrimination, have wide-reaching harmful effects on the physical, social, and
psychological well-being of many African American (AA) families. These stressors place some AA adolescents,
who already experience low rates of physical activity (PA) and high rates of obesity, at even greater risk for
developing chronic diseases. Previous family-based interventions have targeted PA, diet, and sedentary
behaviors to prevent and manage overweight and obesity, but few have been successful for AA adolescents.
We propose that this may be because racial stressors, such as racial discrimination, are a major barrier to
engagement in health promotion efforts, which has been significantly overlooked in previous interventions for AA
families. Resilience-based interventions that empower youth against the deleterious effects of racial
discrimination have shown improvements across a broad range of outcomes including mental health, academic
achievement, and risk-taking behaviors. However, no previous study has evaluated a family resilience and
cultural assets approach for increasing engagement in PA in AA families. The Linking Exercise for Advancing
Daily Stress (LEADS) Management and Resilience intervention integrates a cultural strength-based intervention
to address racial discrimination and related stressors to promote behavioral skills for increasing PA in overweight
AA adolescents and their parents. Based on Murry’s Model, Family Systems, and Social Cognitive Theories, the
proposed intervention integrates components that foster ethnic-racial identity (meaning and value of racial group
identity), ethnic-racial socialization (communication about positive and negative racialized experiences), cultural
assets (spirituality, cultural traditions), and family resilience (parent support, positive parenting, family routines).
We propose that these protective factors as integrated into the LEADS intervention will buffer the negative effects
of racial stressors, especially for those who have greater (vs. lower) perceived racial discrimination at baseline,
which will lead to greater improvements in PA. This approach recognizes the considerable heterogeneity that
exists among AA families in terms of experiences with racial discrimination as a moderate variable. Our pilot
research indicates that the LEADS family-based resilience intervention was feasible and acceptable and led to
increased moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) for adolescents. Thus, the primary aim of this study is 1) to evaluate
the efficacy of the LEADS intervention and moderation effects of perceived racial discrimination on increasing
MVPA from baseline to post-intervention, and maintenance at a 6-month follow-up in overweight AA adolescents.
Secondary aims will examine 2) the effect of the LEADS intervention and moderating effects of racial
discrimination on light PA, dietary intake, family mealtime, body mass index, waist circumference, and blood
pressure outcomes, 3) the effects of the intervention and moderating effects on parent outcomes, as well as
examining 4) mediators of the intervention effect on changes in PA."
10937301,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goal of this project is to determine how morphogens control organ growth. During development, each
body part grows to full size and differentiates complex cell patterns under the control of morphogens, secreted
signaling molecules that spread through developing tissues and organize gene expression, pattern and growth.
The major superfamilies of morphogens are conserved in all multicellular animals, from sponges to man.
Understanding how they work has enormous implications for human health, as genetic and environmental
perturbations of their activities and signal transduction pathways cause diverse developmental and physiological
disorders as well as a wide range of cancers. Research on morphogens is thus critical for developing diagnostic
and therapeutic tools to treat human disease, a central mission of the NIH. Our past studies, using Drosophila,
established that members of two superfamilies of secreted proteins, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and
Wingless/Ints (Wnts) function as bona fide morphogens. Initially we focused on the logic and molecular
mechanisms by which these molecules control gene expression and patterning. Here we turn to the fundamental
and enduring mystery of how they control growth. In the proposed research, we will fill three key gaps in
understanding. First, we will consolidate and extend a new “feed-forward” model for growth based on our recent
discoveries unifying the roles of Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a BMP) and Wingless (Wg) in the developing Drosophila
wing, a classic paradigm for morphogen action. In this model, Wg and Dpp act together to induce and sustain
expression of the selector gene, vestigial (vg), which encodes a transcription factor that “selects” the wing state
and programs wing cells to grow in response to Wg and Dpp. We identified a single enhancer element in
the vg gene that integrates Dpp and Wg input, as well as a “recruitment” signal, the protocadherin Fat. We will
now combine genetic, transgenic and molecular approaches to determine how this integration occurs and to
identify downstream effectors that govern wing growth in response to Dpp and Wg. We will also test a key axiom
of the model—that Dpp and Wg are required continuously, at long-range, to sustain growth—and determine how
these molecules move through tissue. Second, we will apply the approaches and principles that have emerged
from our analysis of the fly wing to elucidate how Dpp and Wg control the growth of other organs. We will focus
on the fly leg in which Dpp and Wg as well as their downstream selector genes and signaling molecules are
deployed in a manner that is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, but distinct from the wing. Our
analysis will build on our preliminary evidence that leg growth is governed by the ranges of Dpp and Wg—as in
the wing—but by different regulatory circuits and logic. Third, we will determine the role of receptor dimerization
or higher order oligomerization in Wg reception by Frizzled (Fz) family GPCRs based on our discovery of
unexpected functional complementation between three of the four Drosophila Fz proteins. This analysis should
provide insight into how Wnts are transduced by the ten Fz proteins in humans."
10936256,"Voice disorders occur in 6–17% of children, resulting in dysphonia (i.e., altered vocal quality), which has
significant negative health, social, emotional, and educational consequences if left untreated. Voice therapy is
the gold-standard treatment for children with vocal fold nodules, the most commonpediatric voice disorder. Most
children diagnosed with vocal fold nodules receive therapy at one of the few specialized pediatric voice clinics
in the country. Families that do not have access to these specialized clinics may turn to the school system for
therapy, however, speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in the school system self-report lower competency
levels and lack of knowledge and comfort in treating pediatric voice. Therefore, the scarcity of specialized
pediatric voice clinics has created a significant health equity issue as children unable to attend specialized
pediatric voice clinics due to lack of financial or physical access will be significantly disadvantaged compared to
their more affluent and well-situated peers. To address this critical gap, the long-term goal of this research
program is to create training programs and materials for SLPs who practice outside of specialized clinics (e.g.,
the schools), with materials based on the best practice derived from expert pediatric voice clinicians. This
research program is designed to address multiple priority areas of the NIDCD, including promoting health equity
(Theme 4) and scientific advancement (Theme 5). Outcomes will also address the NIH-Wide Crosscutting
Priority of reducing health disparities. The current study will identify key themes of expert pediatric voice therapy,
a critical first step to improving the knowledge and skills about pediatric voice therapy for SLPs in all settings.
Outcomes from this work will identify best practices in expert pediatric voice therapy, providing an essential
foundation for a subsequent R01 to develop a training program for treating pediatric voice. In the current work,
pediatric voice therapy sessions will be videotaped without interference at two top, high-volume pediatric voice
centers (Boston Children’s Hospital, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center). Video recordings will be
analyzed offline using a two-phase explanatory sequential mixed method design, with the quantitative analysis
phase followed by a qualitative analysis phase. Aim 1 will use qualitative content analysis to examine
communication methods (relational, instrumental, affective) based on interpersonal communication theory. Aims
2 and 3 will be data-driven thematic analyses of how experts structure therapy sessions, such as the task order
or how to incorporate games and breaks (Aim 2) and how experts implement frequently used therapy tasks (Aim
3). The research will be completed at Temple University (R1 university), which maintains a robust research
environment with exceptional dedication and support to early-career faculty. This Early Career Stephen I. Katz
R01 submission represents two clear changes in direction for the PI, a change in methodology (mixed methods
design, qualitative analyses) and a change in population (expert pediatric voice clinicians)."
10936874,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to define the molecular mechanisms of two underappreciated dementia syndromes known as
Familial Danish Dementia and Familial British Dementia. Both syndromes have highly similar pathologies to
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with onset of dementia as early as 40 years of age. While a majority of AD is age-
related, sporadic, and can be caused by a myriad of events or dysfunctions, the genetic cause of the Familial
dementia syndromes is identified as mutations in the gene that encodes for an integral membrane protein,
BRI-2. Normally, maturation of BRI-2 involves proteolytic processing that generates a 23-residue peptide.
However, the BRI2-derived peptides generated from the mutant BRI-2 proteins are each extended by 11
residues. The extensions differ between Danish and British dementia because the causative mutations differ.
Notably, the earliest manifestation of Danish dementia syndrome is the appearance of cataracts at ages as
early as 20 years, while no ocular symptoms are reported for British dementia patients. The Danish dementia
peptide has been shown to bind to the major protein chaperone responsible for maintaining lens transparency,
-crystallin (HSPB4/HSPB5) and to interfere with its ability to function as a chaperone against model client
proteins, while the British dementia peptide was a much less effective inhibitor of lens chaperone function.
Both Danish and British patients suffer from early-onset dementia, suggesting a shared ability to accelerate
aggregation processes that lead to amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This dichotomy provides a
powerful strategy for defining the key features responsible for 1) protein aggregation that leads to
development of cataracts in Danish patients and 2) accelerated aggregation and plaque formation in both
Danish and British patients. We propose to employ protein reagents and experimental approaches developed
in the ongoing parent grant to investigate how familial dementia peptides interfere with 1) HSPB4/HSPB5
chaperone function towards a lens-specific protein client (D-crystallin) and 2) HSPB1/HSPB5 chaperone
function towards the amyloidogenic protein, Tau. Our approaches include: aggregation assays using bona
fide protein clients under physiologically relevant conditions, quantitative determination of intermolecular
interactions, mapping of interactions at the residue-level by NMR and UV-crosslinking/mass spectrometry,
among others. The chaperones under investigation are constitutively expressed in lens, neurons, and brain
and likely serve to stave off harmful protein aggregation for most of an individual’s lifetime. Understanding the
molecular mechanism of these familial dementias and how chaperone function is disrupted provides a novel
path to understand a broad array of AD/ADRDs and potentially to shore up intrinsic systems such as the small
heat shock protein chaperones to delay and inhibit protein aggregation and amyloid formation throughout an
individual’s lifetime."

The vision of The ASCENT Research Training Program in Sexual and Reproductive Health, Rights, and
Justice (SRHRJ) is to strategically develop an innovative, interdisciplinary, multi-level national research
training experience to increase diverse representation and to enhance the future of SRHRJ-related biomedical,
behavioral, policy, clinical, and translational research. The program will do this through foundational research
curricula, advanced training in community-engaged research (CER), hands-on simulation training, and mini-
immersion experiences, and mentoring, using the Matrix Mentor Model. Currently, research curricula and
mentorship specific to SRHRJ and CER are lacking in consistency and accessibility across academic
institutions, disciplines, and training levels. The stigma and politicization surrounding SRHRJ have created
barriers to comprehensive education, research, and innovation in this crucial field. Strategic efforts are
necessary to progress academic and community partnerships that can lead to critical innovations and
interventions through CER. To address this gap, we have designed a unique research training program with
community-, institutional-, and national support open to Scholars from upper undergraduate to professional
levels. The program goals include, (1) Establishing The ASCENT Research Training Program, creating
administrative excellence and a research training toolkit focused on advanced SRHRJ topics and CER
methods, (2) Providing 10 weeks of focused hands-on research experiences, mentoring, and funding for a
diverse cohort of 8 nationally recruited SRHRJ Scholars; and (3) Develop regional and national opportunities
for scholar advancement through partnerships with the Scholars Strategy Network and the Society for Family
Planning. These national partners will support recruitment and provide a diverse pool of mentors and research
opportunities showcasing specialized research techniques. ASCENT Research Training Program Scholars will
gain SRHRJ knowledge, confidence, and essential hands-on CER experience. The program will support
Scholars in attending and presenting at regional and national scientific conferences to enhance their
professional networks and career trajectories. Successful completion of these activities will establish a multi-
level interdisciplinary SRHRJ Scholar training program, unlike any existing program. Ultimately, this program
and toolkit will increase accessibility to advanced CER techniques, enhance the training experiences of
SRHRJ biomedical scholars, and train a new generation of diverse reproductive health scholars trained in CER
and advanced research approaches."

 Hearing loss affects individuals of all ages, ethnic and socioeconomic groups, and represents the largest
cohort of individuals with sensory disabilities. The impact of hearing loss is most profound during infancy and
schooling years, delaying acquisition of listening and spoken language skills, postponing academic
achievements and blunting career trajectories. The implementation of federally- and state-mandated Early
Detection of Hearing Impairment program and the clinical provision of digital hearing aids or cochlear implants
have become some of the most effective interventions to rehabilitate sensory deficits. Now, more than ever,
students with hearing loss using digital hearing aids or cochlear implants are mainstreamed and obtain
baccalaureate degrees, particularly in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine (STEMM).
Nonetheless, the sum of graduate students with hearing loss remains a minor fraction of the overall graduate
student body in STEMM subjects, and far below that in the general population. Graduate trainees with hearing
loss still struggle with reduced access to auditory information, and must also manage the debilitating challenges
of isolation, ignorance, imposter syndrome and invisibility (the 4Is) in academia. Despite these barriers, there
are individuals with hearing loss or other diverse backgrounds that have succeeded in professorial careers in
STEMM, particularly in the auditory and vestibular sciences who are motivated to mentor the next generation.
 Creighton University proposes to recruit graduate trainees with hearing loss or other diverse
backgrounds to join an existing biomedical sciences graduate training program (with outstanding institutional
commitments) and graduate with doctoral degrees in translational auditory and vestibular neurosciences.
These doctorates, as many as 12 over 10 years, and 22 over 15 years, will provide experiential perspectives
and insights to develop novel strategies that preserve or restore auditory and vestibular function from wide-
ranging etiologies such as congenital, age-related, noise-, drug- or environmental-induced sensory losses.
These newly-minted doctorates, mentored by auditory-vestibular neuroscientists and clinicians (some with
hearing loss), will influence the next generation of research endeavors to preserve or restore hearing and
vestibular function, or other STEMM fields. These outcomes will accelerate the entry of postdoctoral trainees
with diverse backgrounds into lifelong careers in STEMM, especially in auditory and vestibular sciences.
 We will work with the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, the Hearing Loss
Association of America, and research mentoring programs for undergraduates with hearing loss or other diverse
backgrounds, to recruit highly-qualified and motivated trainees into this graduate training program. R25 trainees
and alumni will share their experiences with vertical and horizontal peer network mentoring programs, with
program faculty, and at in-person meetings of the Association for Research in Otolaryngology, the American
Speech-Language-Hearing Association and the American Auditory Society."
10936126,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most lethal tumor of the central nervous system, with
a median survival of less than 15 months (Stupp et al., 2009). GBM tumors display abnormal gene expression
profiles that contribute to their malignant features, and thus understanding the mechanisms of their aberrant
gene regulation is crucial to developing more effective, targeted therapies. An important class of proteins that
control gene expression patterns is the Polycomb (Pc) family. Specifically, the Pc protein RING1- and YY1-
binding protein (RYBP) exerts a tumor suppressive effect across cancer types, and RYBP is frequently
downregulated in GBM patients (Li et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2017). However, the specific role of RYBP in GBM and
the mechanisms leading to its reduced expression in GBM remain unclear. Therefore, we propose to (1)
determine the tumor suppressive effects of RYBP in glioblastoma cells. Our approach will be to stably transduce
GBM cells with lentivirus expressing either RYBP or a GFP control, and in parallel to stably transduce
immortalized astrocytes with lentivirus expressing shRNA against RYBP or a non-targeting control. We will
isolate single-cell clones and use them to (a) determine the in vitro phenotypic effects of RYBP ectopic
expression or knockdown on cell viability, migration, and invasion, and to (b) identify the transcriptional targets
of RYBP-mediated gene regulation using RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing. We
also propose to (2) determine the mechanisms of RYBP silencing in glioblastoma. Specifically, we will (a)
elucidate the contribution of G-quadruplexes, which are secondary structures formed by G-rich regions of DNA
and RNA, to RYBP transcriptional regulation. To do this, we will treat cells with G4-stabilizing ligands or deplete
cells of G4-resolving enzymes via RNA interference, and measure the effects on RYBP expression. We will also
determine whether the putative G4-forming sequences in the RYPB promoter can form bona fide G4s in cells.
Additionally, we will (b) determine the role of microRNAs in inhibiting RYBP protein synthesis by using synthetic
inhibitors and luciferase assays. Collectively, we expect this project to reveal a novel tumor suppressive effect
for the transcription factor and chromatin regulator, RYBP, in GBM, and to identify the transcriptional targets
under its control. The impact of this project will be the placement of RYBP's function within a coordinated,
regulatory context that will expand our knowledge of potential molecular targets, thereby enlightening
development of GBM therapies."

 Background: Evidence-based treatments for depression and treatment adherence in persons with HIV
(PWH) are not reaching a sufficient number of PWH who need them, and untreated depression may hinder all
aspects of the HIV care cascade; especially rates of viral suppression. This is particularly dire in South Africa,
which has the highest number of HIV cases in the world,1 comorbid depression is approximately 30%, and only
0.28 psychiatrists and 0.32 psychologists per 100,000 people are available.2 Prior work: We developed
cognitive behavioral therapy for adherence and depression (CBT-AD) and found it to be efficacious and
effective for treating depression and improving ART adherence.3–8 In SA specifically, we demonstrated superior
effects of CBT-AD on depression, adherence, and viral undetectability in an task-shared effectiveness study
with nurse interventionists.9 CBT-AD was also cost-effective in this context.10 Design. This is a proposal for a
two-arm hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation study using a clinic randomized parallel cluster RCT
design. Across 10 clinics, we will compare a core set and enhanced set of implementation strategies to
increase the reach of evidence-based treatments to patients with HIV and depression in South Africa (SA). The
proposed strategies and outcomes are based on our Implementation Research Logic Model (IRLM)11 which we
developed from our preliminary community-engaged work in SA. Our IRLM links key determinants to
implementation strategies from the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC).12
Implementation Strategies and Outcomes: In both study arms, core strategies include expanding the nurse
cadre role, trainings to decrease mental health stigma, training in depression and depression screening,
education about existing evidence-based depression treatments (including our flip-book treatment manual for
CBT-AD, and referring patients to available evidence-based depression treatments - therapy or
psychopharmacotherapy). In the enhanced arm, strategies also include providing more resource-intensive on-
site training, “train-the-trainer” strategies in CBT-AD, and clinical supervision of the nurse interventionists for
one year. Using the RE-AIM framework,13 the primary implementation outcome is “reach”, the proportion of
patients who start an evidence-based treatment for depression (i.e., CBT-AD and/or psychopharmacotherapy),
though we will also examine, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Effectiveness
outcomes are the percent of patients who show clinical improvement in depression and the percent who attain
viral undetectability within one year. Finally, we will compare high and low reach clinics to further inform
tailored implementation strategies for uptake and maintenance. Impact: CBT-AD is the only treatment that
impacted both HIV and depression outcomes in a prospective trial, has been task-shared in the S. African
context, is cost-effective, and has a set of implementation strategies based on community partnerships and our
prior work. The proposed study will provide a replicable implementation model."

The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) proposes to establish a Bridges to the Baccalaureate
program in partnership with two local associate's degree granting community colleges, Mercer
County Community College (MCCC) and Brookdale Community College (BCC). Our proposed
New Jersey Biomed-Bridge (NJBB) Scholars Program builds upon the strong partnership that
has been established between our institutions. Over the past four years, a growing number of
students from MCCC and BCC have successfully transferred to TCNJ. However, only a small
fraction of these enrollments have been biomedically focused. The NJBB Scholars Program will
provide financial and academic support to six students annually transferring from BCC and
MCCC to TCNJ. Recently renewed articulation agreements as well as detailed curricular
mapping between the biology and chemistry departments provided necessary first steps to
increase the transparency of credit equivalency that students will receive from an Associate’s
Degree in biology or chemistry from MCCC or BCC, and further define the expectations of
students to complete the baccalaureate once at TCNJ. The NJBB Scholars Program will provide
opportunities for courses that have an emphasis on current cutting edge biomedical techniques
and technologies with a strong focus on multi-semester and summer involvement in research.
Coursework, collaboration, independent research, internships, and highly structured mentoring
will provide students with knowledge, science communication skills, ability to problem-solve
collaboratively, and increase student confidence to join the biomedical workforce or to
successfully pursue biomedical-focused graduate studies. Additionally, the community building
afforded by this grant will strengthen the BCC- MCCC-TCNJ relationships for years to come. We
will leverage our strengths and serve as a model to other institutions with an interest in building
capacity for training and retaining students within the robust biomedical career pipelines that are
so prevalent in the state of New Jersey. Organized by five overarching goals, we will determine
our success by assessing the following outcomes: (1) Generate awareness of biomedical
careers; (2) Provide and strengthen academic advising and clear curricular pathways for
community college students to attain a bachelor's degree in four years; (3) Provide guaranteed
independent research experiences and internship opportunities; (4) Develop and provide
mentoring, professional development, and networking experiences which will further increase
the NJBB students’ sense of belonging and identity as scientists; and (5) Increase the numbers
of community college students prepared to enter the biomedical workforce."

Human and Mammalian Genetics and Genomics: the McKusick Short Course, developed through a six- decade
long partnership between Johns Hopkins University and The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), trains the next
generation of basic research and medical genetics professionals. The McKusick Short Course is purposefully an
intense, two-week program that covers human and mouse genetic and genomics processes and the
mechanisms of human disease. With graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, medical genetics residents, and
faculty being the dominant audience, the course offers ~50 lectures, 10 workshops, multiple evening lectures by
featured speakers, a poster session, and both formal and informal networking opportunities over a 12-day period,
uniquely providing medical genetics, mouse genetics, and ethical, legal, and social implications of genomics
content training. The content delivered by the Short Course would normally be covered by one or many more
graduate-level, semester-long university courses. Additionally, the McKusick Short Course will be delivered in a
hybrid format, with online/virtual access to the seminars and, where practical and feasible, the workshops. The
hybrid format enhances inclusivity by reducing barriers to participation for individuals who could not
otherwise attend. Course participation by historically underrepresented groups (URGs) in science increased
nearly 50% during the prior funding period, and well outstrips current estimates of URG enrollment in graduate
school and post-doctoral and faculty employment in the US. JAX continues to be deeply committed to recruiting
and training a diverse group of biomedical scientists, with scholarships to be provided to enable in-person
attendance. Diversity will also be discussed with regards to the initiatives, tools, and resources being generated
to study the genetic basis of disease. This includes best practices for genetics and genomics research to address
ongoing health care disparities, the need for studies of genetically diverse models and populations, and
representation of diverse backgrounds within genetic databases and samples."

The incidence of skin cancer has increased over the past several decades. Limiting exposure to ultraviolet
radiation and engaging in early detection can reduce skin cancer rates and burden. However, fewer than 50%
of US adults engage in prevention strategies to reduce tanning and sunburning, and even fewer examine their
skin or receive a clinical skin examination. Providing information to diverse populations of adults about their
genetic risk for skin cancer – precision prevention – has demonstrated efficacy for improving skin cancer
prevention behaviors. Our prior precision prevention intervention trials incorporating feedback of information on
inherited variation at the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) gene showed (i) significant interest, reach, and test
follow-through, (ii) intervention efficacy among participants at MC1R higher risk, and (iii) comprehensible and
acceptable materials offered in both English and Spanish. Still, our secondary analyses indicated targeted
areas for refinement of intervention materials that have potential to further enhance efficacy. Building from our
encouraging findings, we propose a multisite, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study to evaluate the
impact of a precision prevention intervention to improve skin cancer prevention in diverse patients in low
resourced, community primary care settings, and to identify barriers and facilitators of implementation to
facilitate future scale-up. We will recruit 1430 participants of any race and ethnicity from federally qualified
health centers in Tampa, Florida who report skin cancer risk activities (tanning, sunburning); 1144 will be
randomized within MC1R risk (average, higher) category to receive refined precision prevention intervention
materials anchored in MC1R results or standard (non-genetic) prevention intervention materials, and 238 will
not receive any intervention materials. Primary outcomes of tanning, sunburning, physician-patient
communication about skin cancer prevention, and skin self-examination, and secondary outcomes (hours in
the sun, self-reported sun protection behaviors, referral for and receipt of a professional skin examination) will
be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the effectiveness of receipt of the
precision prevention intervention to improve skin cancer prevention activities over 6 and 12 months.
Effectiveness will be examined separately among participants at MC1R average and higher risk. In Aim 2, we
will theoretically-informed mediators of improvements in primary and secondary outcomes. In Aim 3, we will
assess implementation outcomes, including reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance, and we will
assess implementation equity. We will conduct exit interviews with 30 patients and 20 healthcare workers to
assess barriers and facilitators to intervention participation. If MC1R genetic information impacts prevention
activities, a theoretical 30-50% of all skin cancers could be prevented. Study findings could direct the equitable
dissemination of the intervention nationally to other low resourced, primary care settings and safety-net
organizations."
10936382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mental health problems among U.S. adolescents have risen precipitously in the past decade, along with social
media use, now a staple of adolescent communication and social interaction. Though many believe this is not
coincidence, evidence linking the two are mixed at best. A deeper understanding of the developmental
connections between social media use and mental health has been severely hindered by a distinct dearth of
longitudinal data, scant examination of the dynamic interplay of social media use and mental health among
racially/ethnically minoritized youth, and a puzzling omission of the mental health implications of social media
content. To fill this critical gap, a longitudinal mixed-methods study is proposed with 250 racially/ethnically
minoritized youth and their primary caregivers. In Phase 1, preliminary data will be collected from 50
adolescents and their primary caregivers to optimize research procedures. In Phase 2, a full-scale longitudinal
data collection will be completed with 200 adolescents and their primary caregivers. Data collection in both
Phases will focus on intensive 9-day-long periods where the research team will (1) use Ecological Momentary
Assessment (EMA) four times per day to measure adolescents’ social media use and mental health in natural
settings and (2) continuously capture screenshots of adolescents’ phone screens every 5 seconds to measure
an individual’s social media content exposure. These “EMA/Screenshots epochs” will be supplemented with (1)
detailed surveys of adolescent social media use, mental health, and other relevant factors from youth-caregiver
dyads and (2) interviews with youth. Phase 1 will only involve 1 EMA/Screenshots epoch and a single follow-up
survey/interview. Phase 2 will involve 9 EMA/Screenshots epochs (3 years x 3 epochs/year in fall, spring, and
summer) and 3 annual surveys/interviews. The Phase 2 design will enable the examination of the bidirectional
dynamics between social media use and mental health on daily (Aim 2) and day-to-year (Aim 3) timescales.
This highly innovative project will provide urgently needed information regarding the development of youth
social media use and mental health across middle to high school ages, their reciprocal influences in both the
daily and yearly timescales, and mechanisms of risk for, and resilience against adverse outcomes. This work
will provide critical insights and information needed to inform interventions aimed at mitigating the negative
impact and maximizing the benefit of social media use for racially/ethnically minoritized adolescents’ mental
health."
10936450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging biomedical imaging technology that provides label-free
and depth-resolved images with micron-scale spatial resolution and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Since
its inception in 1991, OCT has revolutionized eye disease diagnosis with over 32 million ophthalmic OCT
procedures performed world-wide annually. OCT-based technologies have also been exponentially adopted in
a wide range of clinical applications, including cardiology, endoscopy, urology, dermatology, and dentistry.
 Traditionally, OCT only provides tissue-level morphological information. Recently, there is a surge in
extending this label-free technology to also delineate the physiological information (e.g., cellular viability, necrotic
regions, and growth dynamics) at the cellular level. The so-called dynamic contrast microscopic OCT (DyC-
µOCT) or dynamic contrast optical coherence microscopy (DyC-OCM) is distinguished from traditional
scattering-based OCT by its emphasis on dynamic fluctuations: the motions of viable cells are accented against
the motionless regions in the OCT images, enhancing the image contrast and revealing both cellular
morphological and physiological information.
 Today, there are two dominating DyC-OCM architectures: spectral-domain OCM (SD-OCM) and full-field
OCM (FF-OCM), each optimized for temporal analysis of different 2D images. Unfortunately, none of the two
dominating DyC-OCM architectures can support the 3D volumetric dynamic contrast analysis even though
organelles and cells are naturally organized in 3D. This limitation mainly comes from the fact that both SD-OCM
and FF-OCM can only provide a voxel rate of ~100 Mvoxel/s but a voxel rate exceeding 1 Gvoxel/s is necessary
for 3D DyC-OCM. Such a high voxel rate has ever only been demonstrated with another OCM architecture,
swept source OCM (SS-OCM). Even though SS-OCM can break through the voxel rate barrier, it suffers from
poor axial resolution, and thus its ability to image cellular structure has been severely limited.
 In this program, we aim to develop the first 3D DyC-OCM technology that simultaneously breaks through the
voxel rate and axial resolution barriers. We will accomplish the goal by introducing several key innovations in
photonic integrated circuit technology to develop a novel swept source architecture (Aim 1) and a scalable
parallel imaging platform (Aim 2). A dual-modality imaging system consisting of a widefield fluorescence
microscope and the 3D DyC-OCM will be developed (Aim 3). Validation experiments will be conducted using in
vitro 3D human heart and intestinal organoids (hHO and hIO, Aim 4). Given the non-invasive nature of 3D DyC-
OCM, together with its high penetration and resolution, we expect to obtain a host of new information on the
dynamics of hHO and hIO development over time. This information will be valuable to evaluate how similar (or
dissimilar) in vitro organoid development is to embryonic and fetal heart and intestine development and guide
new interventions to improve organoid modeling of human development."

10940201,"Molecular markers of Alzheimer’s disease pathology in the human inner ear (NOT-AG-23-032)
ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the United States and, in addition to the
classical symptoms such as memory loss, people with AD have abnormal perceptual and semantic processing
of sound. As hearing loss has recently been identified as one of the top risk factors for the development of
dementia, there is an urgent unmet need to identify the etiological link between hearing loss and AD, and to
develop early interventions. Specifically, the hallmark AD pathology causing neurodegeneration in the brain—
the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) tangles in the brain— may similarly
cause cellular toxicity at the level of the cochlea, damaging the fragile, non-regenerating sensory cells required
for human hearing.
We propose to test this hypothesis via the expansion of Aim 2 of our grant, “Human Ear Cellular Atlas,” and
conduct a multi-faceted analysis of AD pathology in the human inner ear. In Aim 2i, we will define the proteomic
signature of perilymph rapidly collected from patients with AD postmortem, and identify proteins unique to or
differentially expressed in AD patient perilymph compared with that from age-matched, cognitively normal
controls. In Aim 2ii, we will use the collected temporal bones of AD patients to quantify cochlear hair cells,
spiral ganglion neurons (which transmit auditory information to the brain), and synapse density between hair
cells and SGNs, to determine if pathological changes occur within the AD cochlea compared with controls.
Additionally, we will examine the expression of 100+ proteins (identified from perilymph in Aim 2i and including
AD-associated proteins) using a highly multiplex approach along with single-cell imaging. Lastly, in Aim 2iii, we
will correlate AD patients’ perilymph proteomic signatures and cochlear pathology from Aims 2i and 2ii,
respectively, with their clinical and hearing data contained in electronic medical records. We will analyze AD
patients’ (1) level of hearing impairment, including audiometric thresholds, word recognition score, and speech-
in-noise score; (2) cortical load of p-tau and Aβ measured by clinical imaging or from brain sections; and (3)
results of cerebrospinal fluid testing.
The results of these experiments will help elucidate the link between AD and hearing loss by providing the first
reports of the perilymph proteome and cochlear pathology in patients with AD. Such evidence will help inform
the identification of new therapeutic targets for hearing loss as well as potential biomarkers for risk stratification
in this population."

Supplement title: Modulation of chemokine signaling to mitigate radiation induced Paneth cell dysfunction
The risk of large populations encountering radiation exposure is real and growing. Currently, there is a need for
strategies that mitigate gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome. Radiation induced intestinal injury results from
loss of intestinal stem cell and dysregulation of intestinal stem cell niche. Paneth cells (PCs) located at the bottom
of small intestinal crypts are very critical member in ISC niche regulating ISC homeostasis through various
signaling pathways and growth factors. Moreover, PCs are involved in mucosal immunity by secreting
antimicrobial proteins, such as α-defensins. α-Defensins are a family of cationic peptides that form an integral
part of the innate immune system. Macrophages are important for repair and regeneration of intestinal epithelium
following irradiation. However, involvement of myeloid/ macrophages in radiation induced PC dysfunction is not
known. Radiation exposure induces recruitment of inflammatory monocytes and promotes systemic and local
inflammation. We have observed that modulation of chemokine receptor 2 signaling alters intestinal macrophage
population and mitigates GI-ARS. In this proposal by modulating CCR2/CCL2 axis with CCR2 inhibitor we will
determine the macrophage phenotype involved in regulation of PCs radiosensitivity. We will determine PCs
survival and PC derived paracrine signals in mice model of GI-ARS receiving CCR2 inhibitor. Determination of
mechanism of action will facilitate CCR2 inhibitor as a medical countermeasure against radiation under the FDA’s
Animal Rule."

Latinos account for the largest share of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases (60%) and deaths (48%) compared to
any other racial/ethnic group in California. Additionally, Latino households have experienced a dramatic
increase in household food insecurity due to the pandemic. This is especially distressing for Latinos with type 2
diabetes (T2DM) as household food insecurity is associated with worse glycemic control, which has life-
threatening consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic. T2DM, and especially poorly controlled T2DM, is a
risk factor for death from COVID-19. Effective multilevel interventions to improve household food insecurity and
glycemic control are urgently needed for Latinos with diabetes to mitigate disparities due to COVID-19. The
goal of ADELANTE (Addressing Diabetes by ELevating Access to Nutrition: A Trial of Effectiveness) is
to determine whether a multi-level intervention to improve household food insecurity and glycemic
control is effective for Latino patients with diabetes. We will use a type 1 hybrid trial to assess the
effectiveness of the multilevel intervention on the primary outcome of glycemic control (HbA1c) at 6 months.
Participants (n=355) will be randomized to either: 1) 12 weeks of household deliveries of fiber-rich foods
(vegetables, beans/legumes, and whole grains) plus a 12-month remotely delivered, culturally-adapted lifestyle
behavioral intervention called Vida Sana, or 2) a waitlist control arm, receiving the intervention after a 6-month
delay. We will follow participants for 12 months to assess the primary outcome ofHbA1c at 6 months as well as
key secondary outcomes such as HbA1c at 12 months, and diabetes- and COVID-related stress at 6 and 12
months. Additionally, we will recruit up to 2 household members for each participant to assess household-level
secondary outcomes such as household food insecurity, dietary behaviors, and COVID-related stress. To
assess the future potential of implementation and dissemination of the multilevel intervention in primary care
we will use mixed methods including quantitative measures (e.g., intervention dose and fidelity) and qualitative
interviews with participants and key stakeholders (e.g., providers, clinic leadership, community supported
agricultural group) according to the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance) framework. We will involve patients and our longstanding community partners in all phases of
the trial. The trial will take place in Alameda County, California, which is home to a large and diverse Latino
population, at La Clínica de La Raza, a community safety net clinic with multiple locations throughout Alameda
County. Successful completion of these aims will provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of improving
household food insecurity and glycemic control among Latinos with diabetes during the pandemic."

Sexual minority youth (SMY) in general, and Hispanic sexual minority youth in particular (HSMY), report higher
levels of drug use and depressive symptoms, compared to their heterosexual and sexual minority peers.
Moreover, negative health outcomes (e.g., drug use) are even higher for HSMY who disclose to parents who
are unaccepting of their sexual minority youth. In fact, youth disclosure initiates a transition process where
parents may struggle to adjust to youth being a sexual minority, potentially leading to poor family functioning
(e.g., poor communication and low family support). Further, some parents may not know how to be supportive
of their youth and adolescents may lack the needed skills to manage stress and negative reactions that may
have reverberating psychological effects. Given the impact of these co-occurring factors, it is critical to develop
and evaluate family-based preventive interventions to prevent or reduce the adverse health risks that HSMY
face. Interventions need to account for the unique experiences of HSMY and their families, including the
interplay of racism and homophobia, cultural values, family rejection/support, family functioning, and individual
level variables. Currently, there are no evidence-based, family-based preventive interventions that target drug
use and depressive symptoms among HSMY. Our team has begun work to fill this important scientific gap by
developing, pilot testing, and publishing on a family-based preventive intervention for HSMY, Familias con
Orgullo (Families with Pride). Given the promising findings for Familias con Orgullo on drug use and
depressive symptoms, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized controlled trial with 306
HSMY and their parents, the efficacy of Familias con Orgullo on preventing/reducing adolescent drug use (both
frequency and quantity) and depressive symptoms. The aims of the study are: AIM 1: Examine the efficacy of
Familias con Orgullo, compared to community practice, in decreasing past 90-day drug use (frequency and
quantity) and depressive symptoms among HSMY, over 30-months. AIM 2: Examine whether the relationship
between intervention condition and the outcomes are partially mediated by parent support for the adolescent,
parent acceptance, family functioning, adolescent stress, and sexual minority stress (e.g., discrimination).
Exploratory AIM 3: Explore whether gender and baseline levels of parent support for the adolescent, parent
acceptance, family functioning, adolescent stress, and sexual minority stress moderate intervention effects on
the youth outcomes."

10922611,"SUMMARY:
Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors hold great promise for treating genetic disorders. AAVs efficiently
transduce tissues, including skeletal and cardiac muscles, which is attractive for treating multisystemic muscular
diseases. The primary shortcoming of using AAV vectors is their limited cargo capacity (~5 kb), which excludes
many disorders, such as dystro- or dysferlinopathies, from using these vectors as gene transporters. Due to the
large coding sequences of the defective genes, respectively DMD or DYSF, these muscular dystrophies have
not fully taken advantage of this promising therapeutic modality. To circumvent this limitation, miniaturized forms
(i.e, micro-dystrophin or mini-dysferlin) can be delivered by a single AAV vector. However, therapeutic minigenes
have failed to provide complete rescue in animal models, pointing to the need to express full-length proteins for
maximal benefit.
We and others produced full-length dysferlin or larger dystrophins using simultaneous delivery of two
independent AAV vectors, each one carrying the 5’ or 3’ part of the cDNA flanked by a short region of homology.
This dual vector strategy allows recombination of AAV genomes into an open-reading frame, leading to the
expression of large and highly functional proteins when administrated locally. However, low protein levels occur
after systemic delivery of high AAV doses.
To address this fundamental challenge in delivering large genetic cargo in AAVs, we propose to test a novel
method, SIMPLI-GT (Split Intein-Mediated Protein Ligation for Gene Therapy). This strategy expresses large
stable proteins with high efficiency by use of split inteins to mediate peptide trans-splicing extending the use of
AAV gene transfer to genes exceeding the maximum cargo capacity. In a first in vivo proof-of-concept study, we
showed the feasibility of dual or triple AAV approaches to express mini- or full-length dystrophin. Moreover, using
AAV-Myo, we found that low dose (2x1013 vg/kg) generates large dystrophins in striated muscles with nearly
complete physiological rescue. Further, we used this method to efficiently reconstitute full-length dysferlin in
vitro. Therefore, we propose to apply SIMPLI-GT for the treatment of dysferlinopathies:
Phase 1: Aim1: Demonstrate the feasibility of dual-AAV delivery of split dysferlin by IM injections.
Phase 1, Aim 2: Study the functionality of intein-generated dysferlin in murine and human-derived myoblast.
Phase 2: Aim 1: Evaluate and optimize systemic delivery regimen of AAV-Myo intein/dysferlin in mice.
Phase 2, Aim 2: Validate the effectiveness of full-length intein-generated dysferlin in human iPSC-derived 3D-
engineered muscle tissues.
Phase 2, Aim3: Refine the optimal stoichiometry of dual vector in a dose-finding study in mice.
Phase 2, Aim 4: Evaluate the biodistribution of AAV-Myo split intein/dysferlin following intravenous delivery in
large animal."

motivated by the significance of this biology and the emerging opportunities to use RNA modifications as
diagnostic biomarkers and to intervene in epitranscriptomic pathways as a promising novel paradigm in drug
development, especially in cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, emerging evidence points to the significance of the
epitranscriptome in optimizing RNA-based medicines. Alida’s platform technology will make epitranscriptomics

10933687,"Summary: Zinc-APOE4 interaction and toxicity in the central nervous system (CNS)
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stands as the most widespread form of dementia globally, and its prevalence is on a
steep ascent with the increasing aging population. Among the genetic risk factors contributing to AD, the
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, particularly its 4 allele, occupies a central role, accounting for over half of all AD
cases. Meanwhile, the emerging concept of zinc (Zn) dyshomeostasis has gained prominence, owing to its
intriguing association with AD pathogenesis. Zinc, an essential trace element in human biology, assumes a
paradoxical role as it can be neurotoxic at elevated concentrations while also modulating crucial cellular
processes. Notably, multiple studies suggest that Zn can instigate the aggregation of Aβ protein, the primary
constituent of senile plaques frequently observed in AD brains. In neurological conditions marked by apoptotic
neuronal death, chelatable Zn tends to accumulate within neurons, either preceding or coinciding with
degeneration. Given the substantial evidence for apoptotic neuronal demise in AD, the involvement of Zn in this
process warrants thorough exploration. Notably, clinical trials have shown promise in using PBT2, a copper/zinc
ionophore, for AD treatment. Moreover, recent insights indicate that interactions between brain metal ions and
Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), the most potent genetic risk factor for AD, may constitute one of the mechanisms
driving neurodegeneration. APOE exhibits isoform-dependent affinity for Zn, with ApoE2 > ApoE3 > APOE4.
This interaction influences Aβ aggregation, with APOE2 mitigating Zn-induced Aβ precipitation, while APOE4
carriers exhibit a greater abundance of neurotoxic fragments. Dysregulated Zn levels in AD patients could
potentially exacerbate neurodegeneration by affecting ApoE expression, particularly APOE4. However, the
precise alterations in Zn concentration and the effects of Zn overload or deficiency in AD across patients, animal
models, and cell lines remain areas of debate. To address these crucial questions, this study unfolds in two main
aims: Firstly, to investigate the interactions between Zn and APOE4 and their potential impact, utilizing molecular
docking, spectroscopy, and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) to comprehend how Zn influences APOE4
conformation, and exploring the role of metal ion chelators like EDTA. Secondly, to examine the toxicity of Zn-
APOE4 interactions across various brain cell types, encompassing cell viability, cytotoxicity, glial cell activation,
inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and caspase activation, aiming to elucidate their contribution to AD
pathology. These investigations may offer novel insights into Zn’s role and potential therapeutic avenues for AD
by targeting Zn dyshomeostasis."
10931824,"Summary
Aging is the main contributor to many human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD),
that are common, progressive, and have limited therapeutic options. Our lack of understanding the biology of
human brain aging remains a major challenge in the study of age-associated disorders including AD and other
neurodegenerative disorders. While multiple laboratory models such as flies, worms and mice, have uncovered
major pathways in the biology of aging, translating these findings to humans is still incomplete, in part due to
important cross-species differences. Over the past decade, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models
have emerged as an experimental platform to model many human diseases and have contributed great insights
into AD and neurodegeneration broadly. However, one major caveat to hiPSC models is the fetal nature of the
cells. Several methods have emerged to try and integrate ‘aging’ factors into hiPSCs or to directly
transdifferentiate ‘aged’ cells. However, these protocols often rely on atypical aging programs or lack the flexibility
of the hiPSC system.
 One advance over the last 5-7 years is the advent of multi-omic data sets from human post-mortem brain.
The vast amount of data generated by omics technology has great potential to fill the gap in our understanding
of brain aging and age-dependent, cell-type specific genetic programs. A major current challenge, however, is
how to leverage these large, unbiased datasets to identify specific genes that regulate aging pathways.
Manipulating candidate genes in a human neural cell experimental system would enable understanding and in
vitro modeling of cellular brain aging in a tractable experimental system. Such experiments may reveal targets
that can be modified to improve aging phenotypes in human brain cells.
 In order to address these challenges, we have assembled a team of experts in explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) technology (S-I. Lee), human brain ‘omic studies (S. Jayadev), and hiPSC disease modeling
for AD (J. Young). We hypothesize that by applying XAI methods to human brain data sets, we can identify a
tractable set of molecular drivers of brain aging. We further hypothesize that we can manipulate these drivers
in hiPSC models using CRISPR technology to generate aging phenotypes in hiPSC-derived cells. In this two-
pronged proposal, we will first perform proof-of-concept experiments to modulate expression of XAI-identified
genes in hiPSC-derived neurons and glia (microglia and astrocytes) and perform phenotypic assays to assess
cellular hallmarks of aging (R21 phase). Next, we will increase the complexity of our model by integrating
additional omics layers, further developing and refining the XAI techniques and modulating candidate aging
drivers in hiPSC-AD models in a multi-cellular context (R33 phase). These experiments will improve experimental
platforms to study human brain aging and further identify pathways that may be developed therapeutically for
neurodegenerative disorders and human longevity."

The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Behavioral and Community-Based Research Shared
Resource (BCSR) supports a broad array of cancer research, including behavioral, psychosocial, clinical,
translational, and population studies in both community and clinic-based settings. The BCSR’s services are
fundamental to Sylvester’s strategic efforts to address the cancer burden within Sylvester’s South Florida
(SoFL) catchment area (CA), one of the most multicultural and multilingual diverse regions in the US. The
leaders of the BCSR are national experts in cancer disparities, health equity, community engagement,
qualitative and quantitative research methods, and translational science. BCSR services are defined through
the following aims: 1) coordinating the recruitment and retention of diverse study participants (e.g., diverse by
gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, language, and socioeconomic status) that are representative of
SoFL; 2) supporting the development of culturally and linguistically tailored study materials, including
translation of informed consent forms and recruitment materials in Spanish and Haitian Creole; 3) facilitating
data and laboratory specimen collection in clinical and community settings; and 4) assisting with the
development and delivery of research interventions across the cancer continuum, from prevention to
survivorship. Consistent with the 2019-2023 Sylvester Strategic Plan, the BCSR increased the number and
capacity of study recruitment sites in clinic and community-based settings and established new services (e.g.,
biometric screening and medical record data abstraction). During the current reporting period (6/1/2018-
5/31/2023), the BCSR provided services to 40 Sylvester members from all Research Programs as well as 23
other principal investigators engaged in CA-relevant cancer research. Reflecting the critical importance of
BCSR services to Sylvester members, 91% of usage as measured by revenue was by members. Reflecting
the growing demand for services over the reporting period, there was a 52% increase in annual BCSR revenue
from Sylvester members. The BCSR accrued 5,767 study participants to 76 clinical research studies (including
57 studies led by members). Reflecting the diversity of Sylvester’s CA, 37% of these accruals were
Hispanic/Latino(a) (H/L), and 19% were Black. BCSR supported an additional 240 studies (688 study
documents) with translation services. The BCSR also facilitated collection of 5,188 laboratory specimens (e.g.,
blood and saliva) from research study participants. BCSR services facilitated 55 publications by members, of
which 20% (11 publications) were in high-impact journals (JIF ≥10). In alignment with the goals of the 2024-
2028 Sylvester Strategic Plan, future plans include further expanding BCSR recruitment and retention services
at Sylvester’s network locations and additional diverse community settings and expanding support for cancer
research using mobile health tools and devices."

10931847,"Cystinosis is a metabolic disease caused by mutations in CTNS gene and characterized by loss of the cystine efflux pathway
in lysosomes resulting in accumulation of cystine crystals in many organs including kidneys and cornea. Cystinosis patients
begin showing ocular symptoms at the age of 16 months and without appropriate treatment, the entire peripheral stroma and
endothelium can be packed with crystals. By the age of 10 years, patients develop photophobia and eventually complications
such as corneal scars can occur resulting in irreversible damage to the eye. Cysteamine (β-mercaptoethylamine) treats the
disease by reacting with intra-lysosomal cystine to produce mixed disulfide cysteine-cysteamine dimers. The oral dose of
cysteamine achieves therapeutic effects in several organs but its concentration in cornea is inadequate and thus cysteamine
eye drops (CYSTARAN® 0.44%, 8 times daily), are utilized for treating the ocular complications of cystinosis. The 8x
daily delivery of eye drops is difficult for patients and can lead to poor compliance. Additionally, the eye drops contain
preservative benzalkonium chloride which can cause toxicity due to significant exposure from 8 drops daily. The
formulations also cause side effects including burning, redness, and blurred vision due to the acidic pH which is required to
maintain stability of cysteamine. Any exposure to oxygen leads to rapid oxidation of cysteamine to the inactive cystamine,
and thus eye drop bottles are shipped frozen. The oxidation, however, begins after the bottles are thawed and opened for
use, which reduces efficacy. Our goal is to develop contact lenses that can be worn continuously for 8-hours or longer if
vision correction is also needed, to deliver the same amount of drug to the cornea as eight drops a day therapy. Contact
lenses are ideal for treating cystinosis because a higher fraction of drug loaded in the lenses reaches cornea compared to
drops. Additionally, the lenses will be single use daily disposable and thus there will be no need for preservatives. We are
formulating our lenses at neutral pH which will eliminate the discomfort from low pH of the eye drop formulation. Sustained
delivery of cysteamine is challenging from contact lenses due to the low molecular weight. The drug diffuses rapidly in a
few minutes from commercial contact lenses. We have addressed this limitation by developing a patented nanobarrier
technology which increases the release duration from a few minutes to about 2-8 hours for several drugs depending on the
loading of vitamin E nanobarriers in the lenses. Preliminary data shows 2-4 hours sustained release of cysteamine in vitro
and in vivo with 20% vitamin E lenses, and efficacy in dissolving crystals in ex vivo cadaver eyes. The pharmacokinetic
studies in rabbits show that one lens can deliver sufficient drug to match the 7 drops, so about 15% increase in dose is
required. This proposal focuses on GMP manufacturing and one-year potency testing for lenses that are designed to release
the drug in eight hours. Lenses will be developed in various corrective powers which will require changing drug
concentration in the packaging solution and vitamin E loading in lenses to achieve consistent release for all correction
powers. In vivo studies will be conducted in rabbits with zero-power planar lens to demonstrate that the lenses provide
delivery comparable to the 8xdaily drop regimen. Success in this proposed research will be followed by a pre-IND meeting
with the FDA, followed by Phase I clinical studies."

10910566,"Project Summary
In cells, nucleic acids exist as molecular complexes, whose function depends not only on their base-pairing
potential but also on their shapes and chemical structures. The DNA in a cell’s genome forms a highly dynamic
macromolecular structure, called ‘chromatin’, and the DNA can be modified by regulatory proteins (e.g. 5-
methylation of cytosine) or it can be damaged by oxidation or genotoxic compounds. RNA is subject to over 170
different modifications, which can impact its stability, structure, or function. There is a wealth of information in
these nucleic acids beyond their ability to form Watson-Crick base pairings, yet next-generation sequencing
approaches are only able to interpret DNA through its base pairing and loses much of this information. Third-
generation sequencing technologies, such as nanopore sequencing, can theoretically measure modified or
damaged bases. Nanopore sequencing works by passing nucleic acids through an engineered pore and
measuring the current that flows past the five bases of the DNA molecule currently in the pore. Thus, if a modified
base is in the pore, the current will be slightly different than it would be for the unmodified base. However, in
order to recognize these subtle current differences, training libraries with the modified (and unmodified) bases in
every single five-base combination must be sequenced on the device to create a set of reference values that
can be used to decode these subtle changes. This is a complicated and expensive process, beyond the reach
of a single lab, and as such only a couple of modified bases can currently be sequenced by nanopore. My lab
has developed an approach that allows for the rapid and cheap (on the order of several hundred dollars)
generation of these training libraries using procedural barcoded synthesis. With this approach, the generation
of a reference library is easily achievable for a single project by a small academic lab. My lab has generated
training libraries and successfully sequenced numerous modified DNA bases, which has allowed us to perform
innovative multi-dimensional sequencing experiments; reading DNA damage or encoded cellular properties such
as proliferation along with the base sequence. In this project, I seek to expand our technology. First, we will
generate training libraries to allow for direct detection of common damaged bases resulting from processes such
as oxidation or alkylation, which will permit deeper understanding of how DNA damage occurs in settings such
as aging or cancer treatment. Second, we will adapt our method to work with RNA, allowing for direct detection
of the myriad modifications that occur in the transcriptome and are important in the structure, function, and
regulation of mRNA and non-coding functional RNAs alike. The experiments performed as part of this project
will enhance our understanding of how nucleic acids are modified and damaged within cells, and the further
development of our technology will provide invaluable tools for further interrogation of altered nucleic acid bases."
10912449,"CXCR3 is a chemokine receptor (CKR) that plays a central role in inflammation through its regulation of T cell
migration and function. Despite the established clinical relevance of CKRs in disease, there are only three FDA
approved drugs that target the entire chemokine system, which consists of approximately twenty receptors and
fifty ligands that regulate nearly every aspect of inflammation. Reasons for this difficulty in CKR drug develop-
ment include the potential redundancy between multiple chemokine ligands for a given CKR and a lack of
knowledge of how the signaling pathways activated by CKRs regulate immune cell function and inflammation.
Thus, there is a critical unmet need for drugs targeting the chemokine system. This puts into context work from
my group on the chemokine receptor CXCR3. We have shown that the chemokine ligands of CXCR3, CXCL9,
10 and 11, act as biased agonists, generating quantitatively and qualitatively distinct signals from one another
through their interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins and β-arrestin adapter proteins. In the previous project
period, we have identified small-molecule G protein- and β-arrestin-biased CXCR3 agonists that (1) differentially
activate signaling pathways downstream of CXCR3, and (2) have distinct effects in a mouse model of T-cell-
mediated inflammatory skin disease. These findings suggest distinct roles for G proteins and β-arrestin in pro-
moting the CXCR3-mediated inflammatory response. The long-term goal of our research is to determine the
mechanisms underlying biased agonism to develop novel therapies targeting CKRs in inflammation. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine how CXCR3 biased agonists promote different effector conformations
that lead to distinct patterns of signaling resulting in changes in T cell function and inflammation. Our central
hypothesis is that β-arrestin-biased agonists promote unique receptor and β-arrestin conformations that favor
“location-biased” endosomal signaling that promotes a unique transcriptional response in T cells and inflamma-
tion. To address our objective, first, we will determine how the receptor:ligand complex promotes biased re-
sponses through allosteric regulation of effectors. We have found that CXCR3 biased agonists promote different
β-arrestin-mediated effects, which we will explore further by using receptor mutants. Then, we will determine
how endosomal signaling and location bias contribute to CXCR3 biased signaling. We have found that some
CXCR3 biased agonists promote transcription that can be prevented by inhibiting receptor endocytosis. Lastly,
we will determine how CXCR3 G protein- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways contribute to T cell function
and the inflammatory response. We will use CXCR3 mutants to test the contributions of specific signaling path-
ways to T cell chemotaxis in vitro and inflammation in vivo. This project explores an innovative approach to study
CXCR3 signaling that will provide an understanding of CXCR3 regulation of the inflammatory response by the
selective activation of G proteins and β-arrestins. The research is significant as it will lay the groundwork for
research on biased agonists as therapies targeting CXCR3 and serve as a model for drug design at GPCRs."
10912538,"Project Summary/Abstract
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) works to ensure the safety
of the food and feed supply through effective prevention, intervention, and response
programs. Within CDFA, the Commercial Feed Regulatory Program (CFRP) is
responsible for the enforcement of California state law and regulations pertaining to the
manufacturing, distribution and labeling of commercial livestock feed while preventing
adulterated feed from being consumed by livestock.
The goal of the proposed project is to maintain and enhance California’s fully
implemented Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) while building
CFRP’s ability to perform regulatory work and promote compliance with the Preventive
Controls for Animal Food (PCAF) rule. Through active participation in the AFRPS,
CFRP has strengthened its already robust inspection and enforcement programs,
industry education and training programs, and feed emergency response programs,
while also implementing program assessment and accountability measures. This
cooperative agreement would enable CFRP to further develop and sustain the best
practices implemented under the AFRPS while simultaneously working to build capacity
to conduct comprehensive inspections for compliance with the PCAF rule.
CFRP is seeking $525,000 annually for the next five years; this includes $225,000 for
maintenance and enhancement of the AFRPS, plus $300,000 to support incorporation
of CGMP and PC animal food inspections. Funds will be used to support one dedicated
staff member to continue further development and maintenance of the AFRPS, plus an
additional staff member to oversee implementation of the preventive controls funding
option. These funds will supplement existing capabilities and will enable CFRP to further
enhance its animal feed regulatory program through additional training and
development of staff, enhanced information sharing and interagency collaboration, and
expanded program evaluation. Ultimately this will allow the program to build a
foundation that will support sustaining full conformance with AFRPS and PCAF
compliance beyond this grant period. This will increase CFRP’s ability to conduct high-
quality comprehensive inspections and investigations to reduce the incidence of animal
feed contamination and, ultimately, foodborne illness associated with animal products."
10912539,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Dictyostelium Community Resource (DCR) is an integrated resource for investigators using Dictyostelium
and related species for biomedical research and training. The DCR integrates two previously separately funded
resources, dictyBase, the model organism database and the Dicty Stock Center, the strain and materials
collection for Dictyostelids, to create a comprehensive community resource. The DCR is a combination of a
computational and physical resource - each with separate roles but sharing infrastructure and user clientele.
Given their related and interconnected goals, this integration of the two promotes efficiency, allowing users to
obtain both curated information and research materials from the same organization. The DCR, widely supported
by the research community, provides gold standard expert literature curation of genes, functional annotations
using the Gene Ontology and a wide range of genomic resources in an intuitive and readily searchable online
resource. Dictyostelium is widely used to study cellular processes such as cell motility, chemotaxis, signal
transduction, cellular response to drugs, and host-pathogen interactions. Dictyostelium's genome contains
significant orthologs of vertebrate, yeast and microbial genes, attracting researchers interested in a wide variety
of biological topics including human disease, multicellular differentiation and comparative genomics. The DCR
enables researchers to search, view and download up-to-date genomic, functional and technical information. It
is also widely used by teachers/instructors due to the wealth of available teaching materials and research
protocols. Dictyostelium investigators depend on dictyBase as their primary community resource, where help
from dictyBase staff (DCR help line) or from other users (Dicty ListServ, moderated by the DCR) is available.
We are in the final stages of deploying our completely new technology stack. By the end of this year dictyBase
will be run entirely as a cloud-based application. This propoal seeks support the operation and expansion of this
important community resource. Our goals for this proposal are: (Aim 1) Support the community of investigators
using Dictyostelium and related species, (Aim 2) Provide scientific curation of D.discoideum and related species
for community of investigators, (Aim 3) Maintain and distribute the strain collection; (Aim 4) Expand the Coverage
of Species and Strains; (Aim 5) Improve Accessibility and Utility of the DCR. This support would build upon NIH
funded resources by fully integrating and improving them."

Without a CTSA hub within 250 miles, Frontiers plays a critical role in addressing the science and health care
workforce needs for clinical and translational research (CTR) in the Midwest. Alumni of Frontiers career
development programs drive research for improvements in clinical and public health practice - advancing the
delivery of innovations to the patients and communities that need them. Frontiers brings together more than
200 federally-funded investigators in CTR drawn from eight regional Midwestern institutions with strong track
records of working across state lines and institutional boundaries to advance interdisciplinary research. The
overarching goal for the
mentoring, tool
F
s, and environment need ed to become successful transl ati onal researc
rontiers KL2 career development program is to prov ide early stage scientists with the
hers.
Since 2011 when the Frontiers CTSA was first funded, 20 scholars have been enrolled and 16 scholars have
completed the program. One hundred percent of graduates remain engaged in research with 93% of our
graduates leading NIH-funded or major foundation-supported research projects, participating as key personnel
on interdisciplinary research teams, or leading research in entrepreneurial ventures. KL2 scholars have more
than 500 publications. Scholar project topics have run the gamut from methodological projects for statisticians,
to basic research in gene-environment interaction, to behavioral health projects in sexual health for vulnerabl e
populations. Scholars come from a diverse background of training experiences, with a complement of clinical
PhDs (25%), research PhDs (35%), and MDs (40%). In this renewal, we seek to recruit a more racially and
ethnically diverse applicant pool, surround these scholars with mentoring teams that provide sponsorship in
addition to content expertise, and train scholars to conduct cutting edge CTR. We propose the following aims:
Aim 1. Recruit a promising and diverse pool of KL2 scholars to expand CTR infrastructure for the
region and the nation.
Aim 2. Help KL2 scholars build exceptional mentor teams who will guide, advocate for, and sponsor
scholars, so that they will succeed and stay motivated to move meaningful research into practice.
Aim 3. Train KL2 scholars in the competencies needed to conduct scientifically rigorous research that
will accelerate the timeline for meaningful CTR contributions for the region and the nation.
Aim 4. Employ continuous improvement strategies to evaluate KL2 recruitment, mentorship, and
career development with the goal of accelerating the development of CTR scientists and increasing the
impact of their scientific contributions.
Integration of our KL2 training program with our overall CTSA goals will help ensure a close alignment between
the needs and resources of Frontiers-affiliated institutions and will increase the likelihood that our scholars will
be able to address the CTR needs of our region and the nation.

10914019,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the United States and still remains
incurable. Due to its impaired immune response, CLL has high number of morbidity and mortality
complications including increase risk of infections and second cancers. Therefore, identifying individuals who
are at markedly higher risk of developing this disease may enable future prevention strategies. Monoclonal B-
cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is the precursor state to CLL. The prevalence of MBL increases with age and is
found in almost a third of Caucasians older than 60 years. The prevalence of MBL in African Americans (AA)
is not well established. Although all individuals with CLL pass through the MBL precursor state, the reason
why some individuals with MBL progress to CLL yet many do not is unclear. Therefore, there is a need to
identify biomarkers that differentiate those MBL who will progress versus those who will remain asymptomatic.
The overall goal of this application is to address this knowledge gap by evaluating genetic and epigenetic
factors associated with risk of progression to CLL among an established cohort of 1,729 Caucasian individuals
with MBL. Importantly there is a widening equity gap with respect to our understanding of MBL and progression
to CLL in AA populations. Motivated by this, we will also take the initial steps to begin reducing this gap by
developing an MBL cohort of AA individuals through screening of 4,000 AAs and then undertake important
preliminary work of evaluating the genetic and epigenetic factors in our new AA MBL cohort. In Aim 1 we will
analyze the polygenetic risk score (PRS) comprised of a weighted average of 41 inherited single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been previously identified through genome wide association studies (GWAS)
of CLL with risk of progression to CLL. In Aim 2 we will perform deep targeted sequencing of 59 putative CLL
driver genes to investigate if individual genes with high-impact mutations or the aggregate number of mutated
genes leads to an increased risk of progression from MBL to CLL. Finally, in Aim 3 we will evaluate whether
methylation signatures that classify MBL individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk predict progression
to CLL. At the completion of this application, we will have identified three complementary yet independent
genetic and epigenetic factors that we hypothesize will be strong predictors of progression to CLL among a
cohort of Caucasian MBLs. Our preliminary data support our hypotheses. We have the largest cohort of
individuals with MBL collected in US, putting us in an unsurpassed situation to prospectively evaluate the effect
of known CLL risk factors at the precancer phase. Our integrative predictive model of all three biomarkers may
change current practice guidelines and ultimately improve quality of life by reducing anxiety and distress for
individuals in pre-malignant phase. Finally, because little is known about the generalizability of these genetic
and epigenetic factors in AA, we enhanced the significance of our application by taking the initial and vital
steps to build resources to begin the explorations of these genetic and epigenetic factors in AA individuals."

This grant supports a project to generate and characterize Xenopus mutants in key genes related to human
disease, develop new transgenic lines for genome editing and establish efficient site-specific integration. The
long-term goals of the studies are to generate new models of human disease that will provide useful resources
for the biomedical research community. The proposed studies will use CRISPR-Cas gene editing to create
precise models of human disease in the amphibian Xenopus. The current studies are focused on developing
Xenopus models of many different diseases for the entire Xenopus community, and each mutant will be
developed in close coordination with individual researchers. There are four main aims to this proposal. First,
we propose to collaborate with Xenopus researchers to characterize existing mutants (over 200) that were
developed over the last 5 years. The mutants cover a wide range of topics that require varied expertise that
can only be obtained through interactions with other researchers. Second, we propose to generate new
mutants using CRISPR-Cas as requested by researchers. As the national stock center for Xenopus, we have
the expertise to breed and maintain these mutants. Third, we will generate new transgenic lines that will be
used for genome editing. These new lines will allow for more tissue-specific expression of Cas9. Fourth, we
propose to develop homology directed repair for more efficient generation of site-specific integration of
exogenous DNA. All these aims will help enhance the utilization of CRISPR-Cas gene editing methods in the
Xenopus model system."

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder among the elderly population. Recent studies with large sample
sizes found that knee OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia. Nevertheless, the
reason why knee OA is associated with increased dementia risk remains unknown. Recent evidence
suggested that dysfunction of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system and neuroinflammation mediate both
chronic pain and cognition/memory; therefore, these factors may play a significant role in the accelerated
cognitive decline in individuals with knee OA.
Taking advantage of the recently funded NCCIH/NIH project (R01AT012173-01A1) on brain mechanisms of
mind-body and neuromodulation treatment of knee OA, this ancillary application aims to expand our research
on mechanisms underlying accelerated cognitive decline in people with knee OA. Specifically, with the support
of new funding, we will 1) add a cohort of pain-free individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a
cohort of pain-free controls who do not have MCI (25 in each group); 2) collect blood samples to assess
inflammation markers; and 3) add cognitive measurements to assess the cognitive function of the knee OA
patients and new cohorts of participants. With newly collected data, we will 1) investigate the functional and
structural changes in the brain associated with the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system in MCI (individuals
with MCI vs. controls) and knee OA (individuals with knee OA vs. pain-free controls) and identify the common
functional and structural changes associated with MCI and knee OA; 2) investigate the inflammation markers
associated with MCI and knee OA; and 3) explore the association between inflammation markers, brain
function and structure, and cognitive function as well as the modulation effect of alternative treatments on the
above measurements.

This proposal is the third renewal for a T32 training program for the Division of Surgical Oncology at the University
of Pittsburgh. The singular goal of this program is to prepare surgeons for a career as translational scientists in
the field of biologic therapy of cancer. We will pursue this goal by providing the trainees with an immersive
experience that will stress three core proficiencies necessary to be a successful translational scientist 1) Basic
laboratory research skills. 2) Fundamental principles of clinical investigation 3) Pragmatic experience in clinical
trial management. At the completion of this training program the surgical trainee will be uniquely prepared to
bridge the gap between clinical and laboratory research. Our expectation is that this will enhance their ability to
compete for positions and funding in their first faculty position. The applicant pool will include surgical residents
(largely from University of Pittsburgh) who are interested in surgical oncology. In addition to a thorough and
innovative training program, we also developed a comprehensive plan for training in responsible conduct of
clinical research and methods for enhancing reproducibility. We have included an aggressive approach to
recruitment and retention of under-represented minorities. Given the long and proven track record of our surgical
oncology faculty in performing cutting edge translational research this program is uniquely positioned to fill an
important societal gap in training and supporting surgeon scientists."

The aim of this supplement under PA-23-189 is to bring Kylie Wright, who is from an underrepresented
background (i.e., individual with disabilities, first generation of college, low socioeconomic status, female in
neuroscience) in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, social sciences and neuroscience in our institution and the
U.S. to work on parent grant R01AG072658 (Characterizing and Modulating Neurocognitive Processes of
Learning to Trust and Distrust in Aging). This project offers an excellent context for Kylie's research agenda and
training development given her strong interests in the neurobiological and physiological changes that accompany
cognitive and socioemotional aging; and towards her longer-term goal of becoming an independently funded
researcher in decision neuroscience and aging/ADRD. The supplement will provide Kylie with the unique
opportunity to (i) develop profound knowledge about the neurophysiological processes involved in decision
making and trust in aging/ADRD; (ii) foster her skills in advanced statistical analysis of behavioral, physiological,
and neuroimaging data; and (iii) refine her scientific communication skills (i.e., academic writing, oral
presentation). Kylie will work closely with her mentoring team which includes experts in experimental aging and
neuroimaging (Dr. Ebner), decision neuroscience (Drs. Lighthall and Wilson), statistical analysis of behavioral
and neuroimaging data (Dr. Lin), and physiological data analysis on trust-related processes (Dr. Ten Brinke). A
funded supplement will grant Kylie with protected research time to study the impact of interoceptive awareness
(i.e., the ability to accurately read one's bodily signals) and social cue recognition (e.g., the ability to correctly
identify others' facial emotions/infer others' intentions) on trust learning among healthy older adults and those at
increased risk for developing ADRD. The proposed supplement research will directly contribute to each of the
three aims in the parent grant: Toward Aim 1 (to identify cognitive mechanisms that drive deficits in trust learning
in aging/ADRD) Kylie will capture differences in interoceptive awareness and social cue recognition capability
and determine their effect on trust learning; toward Aim 2 (to identify altered neurocircuitry underlying age-
associated trust learning deficits in aging/ADRD) Kylie will delineate associations of age/ADRD-related brain
changes in regions implicated in trust learning (e.g., anterior insula) with differences in interoceptive awareness
and social cue recognition; toward Aim 3 (to test malleability of neurocircuitry implicated in trust learning toward
optimized trust learning in aging/ADRD) Kylie will test moderation effects of interoceptive awareness and social
cue recognition on real-time fMRI neurofeedback training success."
10906361,"Episodic heavy or binge drinking and the associated health and social consequences are substantial public health concerns, with a high prevalence among young adults. This is particularly true among US military personnel. While alcohol consumption in the US military is very high and normative, there is zero tolerance for getting in legal trouble while drinking, and Airmen who do get in alcohol-related legal trouble (e.g., DUI, sexual assault) typically receive what is called an Alcohol Related Incident (ARI). In other populations, Brief Alcohol Interventions (BAIs) for alcohol misuse have been validated as efficacious with robust evidence for mostly college young adults who report episodic heavy drinking. Many BAI studies have targeted young adults who drink hazardously; these individuals are generally not interested in abstaining from alcohol, but are often willing to decrease the amount they drink or change the manner in which they drink in order to reduce harmful consequences. We have previously published1 the results of a BAI group- based intervention that has been shown to reduce ARIs universally (not in just high risk drinkers) in over 150,000 on average by 16%. Since we began in 2010, the BAI has been disseminated to most Airmen in Technical (Advanced) Training in the USAF. However, it is clear that additional research is needed to enhance the efficacy of our BAI intervention and to reduce the risk associated with problem drinking behavior. One such strategy that could improve health promotion outcomes is well timed and tailored automated text messages. Building on our preliminary study where text messages reduced driving after drinking as well as total drinks consumed before driving (See Previous Work), text messaging may be highly effective as the precise time that Airmen gain access to alcohol (when they are allowed off base for the first time) is known and is the same time for all Airmen. One of the challenges to conducting alcohol research in the military is the lack of privileged communication. As a result, it is difficult to obtain valid self-reports due to a tendency to deny or minimize use. Fortunately, we have recently validated a method developed by our research team for collecting anonymous data over time. We propose to conduct what is the first study in the military, as well as the first large scale, adequately powered trial, where intervention effects will be tracked out to a one year follow-up. Our findings would have strong implications for conducting research in both civilian and military populations. Thus, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) We will randomize approximately 3000 Airmen to either the currently administered group BAI versus the BAI + Interactive Counselor Facilitated Text messages timed to occur before, during, and after Airmen have access to alcohol; and (2) To evaluate the efficacy of the intervention at a 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-up using repeated anonymous surveys with unique identifiers allowing us to match up surveys while simultaneously maintaining anonymity."

Cancer disproportionately affects Black Americans and other economically disadvantaged groups, yet these
individuals are underrepresented in cancer research. The Cancer Undergraduate Research Education Program
(CUREP) proposes to address this disparity by expanding and diversifying the pool of future cancer researchers
within the biomedical workforce. Our objective is to create a summer undergraduate research program in
collaboration with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), North Carolina Central University
(NCCU), and North Carolina A & T University (NCAT), two historically Black universities. CUREP aims to admit
12 undergraduates from underrepresented groups (URGs) each year, focusing on first-generation college
students, those from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds, and those with limited prior
research experience. The program has three specific aims: 1) Provide URG students with hands-on experience
in cancer research during a ten-week summer internship. 2) Increase student interest in pursuing careers in
cancer research by offering professional development activities essential for gaining admission to graduate and
professional schools. 3) Provide year-long group coaching (covering summer, fall, and spring) to help students
integrate academic and life skills and increase their chances of successfully completing their degrees. CUREP
offers participants opportunities to expand their knowledge, explore various aspects of cancer research, and
develop the skills needed for successful careers in cancer research. The program's key components include
direct research experience under the guidance of principal investigators conducting cancer research. These
faculty mentors come from diverse backgrounds, including URGs, and possess expertise in basic cancer biology,
population science, translational cancer research, and cancer disparities. Our program's structure builds upon a
previously funded NIH U54 partnership educational program, Partners, focused on cancer health disparities
between UNC and NCCU (NCI U54 CA156735). Though about two-thirds of Partners alums are pursuing
advanced degrees, students face challenges in various aspects of their lives. Our innovative approach integrates
academic study with life skills coaching, creating a comprehensive program to prepare young scientists for future
challenges. Students will conduct independent research under the supervision of PI mentors, graduate students,
and postdocs in laboratories or research teams specializing in population science. Their research experiences
will be complemented by training in ethics and various professional and career development activities,
culminating in research presentations at the end of the summer. A distinguishing feature of CUREP is its year-
long coaching component, encompassing study skills, academic writing, time management, self-efficacy, career
planning, and wellness. This holistic approach enables participants to integrate academic and social/life skills
effectively. Ultimately, CUREP aims to increase the participation and representation of URGs in cancer research,
contributing significantly to the diversification of the biomedical workforce."

The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC), California National Primate Research Center
(CNPRC), and Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) present a unique combination of resources and expertise to
support and enhance “studies…of primate species life span differences, and mechanisms that may mediate
such relationships,” per RFA-AG-24-019. This R61/R33 application proposes a newly instantiated Coordinating
Center for Primate Aging Research (CCPAR) jointly led by these institutions. The CCPAR will coordinate the
work of a broad array of specialists across gerosciences and facilitate integration of data from R01s across
sites, endpoints, approaches to measurement, and species. Both NPRCs have well-established NIA-supported
colonies of aged rhesus macaques and core scientists engaged in aging-related research. These two NPRCs,
along with the broader NIH-funded NPRC Consortium and BCM, are uniquely qualified to successfully lead the
proposed CCPAR. The CCPAR will build a community of transdisciplinary nonhuman primate (NHP) aging
researchers, develop novel resources to facilitate rigorous studies and data harmonization, and disseminate
resources to the broader community through data sharing and public-facing communication. There will be a
focus on training, best practices, communication, and outreach within the Coordinating Center that forms the
basis of broadly distributed “white papers.” There will be a commitment to enhancing the quality of data on
longevity and health span, as well as the availability of such data through dedicated IT experts, databases, and
websites. The overall goal is to increase the harmonization and integration of existing data while putting
systems in place to enhance data sharing for future studies. The CCPAR has the expertise necessary to assist
in the design of robust methods, interpret multiple types of data, and link genetic data to cellular and behavioral
data as well as key environmental events that influence aging. We will pursue the following three Specific
Aims, with the first two pursued in the R61 and R33 phases, and the third primarily pursued in the R33 phase:
Aim 1. Enhance the quality and synergy of projects supported through RFA-AG-24-019 and facilitate the public
accessibility of their results; Aim 2. Identify promising directions for future research on determinants of species
differences in human and nonhuman primate life spans and age-related outcomes through activities that
engage researchers from pertinent fields; and Aim 3. Enhance the quality, public availability, and
interoperability of data sources needed to design and implement research on determinants of species
differences in human and nonhuman primate life spans and age-related outcomes."
10933755,"Summary/Abstract
 This “test of concept” R21 is to explore a novel concept on the role of circular RNAs in aging-related sepsis
and organ damage. Circular RNA (circRNA) is a type of single-stranded RNA that forms a covalently closed
continuous loop. The biological function of most circRNAs is unclear. CircRNA does not have 5' or 3' ends. The
unique structure of circRNAs provides them with a longer half-life and more resistance to RNase R than linear
RNAs, which makes them potential candidates for diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. People
who are aging are more susceptible to pneumonia than any other group and are also more likely to develop
infections from gram-negative (G-) organisms than younger adults. Moreover, the mortality of acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) increases significantly in older patients. Macrophages (MΦs) form the first line of
host defense against microbial pathogens via protective inflammatory responses. The high mortality and
morbidity after bacterial infections often result from an imbalance in host defense between bactericidal and an
excessive inflammatory response that leads to tissue damage. Currently, the initiation, propagation, and
regulation of inflammatory responses in the presence of G-bacterial infection remain incompletely explored,
particularly in aging populations, impeding the development of novel and specific therapeutics for the elderly.
We initially screened circRNAs in mΦs from both young and old mice with and without LPS. We found that
circular RNA-20033 (circ20033) is highly upregulated by LPS in the BALF EVs from older mice (78 weeks, 78w)
compared to the younger ones (12w). We previously reported that BALF EVs are mostly derived from MΦs after
sepsis and infections.17 Therefore, we will focus on MΦs in this proposal. Circ20033 is derived from the Slc39a10
gene via back-splicing. Modulating circ20033 does not have an impact on its host gene suggesting that circ20033
carries a distinct function. Computational modeling analysis suggests that circ20033 interacts with several ‘anti-
inflammatory’ miRNAs, including but not limited to the miR-182/183, miR-330, miR-326, and miR-192. Elevated
Circ20033 in the elderly but not in the young ones, along with its prolonged half-life, potentially inhibits the ‘anti-
inflammatory’ miRNAs via sponging effects, subsequently promoting a runaway inflammation too. Our central
hypothesis is that aging-associated circ20033 un-regulation facilitates G-bacteria/LPS-induced, dysregulated
lung inflammation and lung injury via promoting NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. We propose
two specific aims: Aim I: To determine the function and mechanisms of aging-induced circ20033 in macrophage
pro-inflammatory activation after bacterial infections. Aim II: To determine the role of aging-induced circ20033 in
lung inflammation in vivo after bacterial infections."

Vaccination has had a remarkable impact on the health of the world’s population and has been shown to be a
safe, cost-effective, and powerful means of preventing deaths and improving quality of life. The University of
Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) training grant in Vaccinology has been
training exceptional vaccine scientists for 25 years. Our program is firmly anchored on our past successes but
has rapidly incorporated innovative new technologies, cutting-edge strategies, state of the art data analytic tools
and novel educational approaches to train the next generation of leaders in Vaccinology. Collectively, the 35
faculty members participating in this training grant represent one of the largest and most accomplished teams of
academic vaccine researchers in the country. These faculty study all phases of Vaccinology, each through their
independent, established and well-funded research programs, and have been selected not only for their
particular expertise but for their experience and commitment to training postdoctoral MDs and PhDs in vaccine
research. Our highly regarded, well-established program includes a basic core curriculum designed to convey
the interdisciplinary nature of the field and provide context for the specific area of research to be pursued by the
trainee. Additional academic work, including required training in the responsible conduct of research,
professional development, and a highly structured mentoring program, will be combined with a tailored research
experience in one of two tracks: 1) Pathogenesis, Immunology and Antigen Discovery Track – preparing basic
and physician scientists for a career in laboratory research, or 2) Clinical, Epidemiologic Science and Policy
track -preparing physician-scientists and PhD epidemiologists in human controlled infection models, clinical trial
study design and execution, and vaccine policy and epidemiology. Recruitment of trainees from
underrepresented minorities is given high priority through innovative programs at the University and those
specific to our training grant. Our training program is led by two Co-directors, with specific skills in the two
investigative tracks and both highly qualified, and is guided by Internal and External Advisory Committees
comprised of internationally recognized leaders in academic medicine and Vaccinology. The ultimate measure
of our training program is to prepare our trainees to become leaders in academia, government and the private
sector, and to contribute new knowledge in Vaccinology measured by excellent records of publications, funding,
and awards."

The development of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and AD Related Dementias (ADRD) is impacted by biological,
clinical, socio-demographic, and lifestyle factors. Therefore, training the workforce for AD/ADRD research
requires an interdisciplinary approach that is informed by community and clinical need, which is in turn critical to
rapid translation of fundamental research into practice and communities. This proposal aims at developing an
interdisciplinary training program for nurturing 9-10 predoctoral trainees annually (6 of 10 in years 1-4 and 5 of
9 in year 5 trainees will be supported by NIH, and 4 each year will be supported by Arizona State University
(ASU), who will be mentored by a team of faculty from different units/schools at ASU and clinicians/researchers
from Mayo Clinic, Banner Alzheimer Institute, Barrow Neurological Institute, and TGen, with diverse expertise
covering AD/ADRD clinical science, diagnostics and engineering, disease biology, data science, and drug
discovery/development. The training program will leverage AD/ADRD resources in Arizona and actively engage
the Arizona Alzheimer’s Consortium (AAC) and the Arizona Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC).
The program is in a unique position to partner with Mirabella, a senior living community on the ASU campus, and
Hospice of the Valley, Arizona's leading provider of end-of-life care, and other community partners to provide the
trainees with real-life experiences. The team has designed a unique program with well-rounded training
opportunities covering the following four dimensions: curriculum-based training, research training, career
development, and community-based real-world experiences. Recognizing the exponentially increasing amount
of data in all disciplines involved in AD/ADRD research and the critical and often enabling role that Artificial
Intelligence (AI) plays in data-intensive research, the proposed training program employs a data-centric
approach with AI being a bridge serving to connect all the involved disciplines through its role as a data
processing and inference engine. Accordingly, the focus of the proposed curriculum-based training and research
training is on helping the trainee to gain the fundamental knowledge and research skills in employing AI for
AD/ADRD research. The training faculty have established track records, not only for pursing AI and AD/ADRD
research, but also for doctoral student mentoring. Further, there are active collaborations among the training
faculty, which have helped to shape the design of the initial set of research projects that are ready to be deployed
for the choice of the first batch of trainees."
10934147,"Many flaviviruses are adapted to dual-host transmission and maintained in cycles between hematophagous arthropods (i.e. mosquitoes and ticks) and vertebrates. An example of mosquito-borne flavivirus (MBFV) is Zika virus (ZIKV), which is a human pathogen of global concern. Other flaviviruses, such as Long Pine Key virus (LPKV), replicate in mosquitoes and phylogenetically affiliate with MBFVs, but lack the capacity to infect vertebrate cells. These viruses are known as dual-host affiliated insect-specific flaviviruses (dISFs). The precise sequence elements and virus-host interactions that modulate the differential host ranges of MBFVs and dISFs have not been defined. Identification of these sequences and virus-host interactions would provide key insight into why some flaviviruses infect and cause devastating disease in humans while others are insect-specific. In the initial funding period, we identified the broad genetic determinants that modulate the differential host ranges of MBFVs and dISFs. Through the construction and characterization of chimeric viruses, we demonstrated that ZIKV loses its vertebrate-infecting tropism when its 5’ untranslated region (UTR), adjacent capsid protein (C) gene, and 3’ UTR are replaced with those of LPKV, while its mosquito-infecting phenotype is retained. The UTRs contain highly structured elements that interact with NS3 (the viral helicase) and NS5 (the viral RNA polymerase) to regulate genome replicate. The UTRs, NS3, and NS5 of MBFVs also interact with many host proteins, but the host proteins that comprise the dISF replication complex are unknown. The overall goal of this continuation is to dissect the 5’- and 3’-terminal ends of the flavivirus genome to pinpoint the precise sequences responsible for flavivirus host-specificity and to compare the virus-host interactions that occur during MBFV and dISF replication through the identification and functional characterization of host proteins that bind to their UTRs, NS3, and NS5. Three independent aims have been designed to achieve this goal. In aim 1, we will dissect the 5’ UTR, C gene, and 3’ UTR of the genomes of LPKV and ZIKV to identify the specific sequences responsible for their differential host ranges. Chimeras of LPKV and ZIKV will be created and the abilities of the resulting viruses to replicate in vertebrate and mosquito cells will be assessed. We will initially focus on each secondary structure (e.g. stem-loops, hairpins, dumbbells), either alone or together with others, then target specific sequences in structures of greatest interest. Subsequent experiments will be performed using additional dISFs and MBFVs to determine whether the genetic determinants that modulate host-specificity are shared among flaviviruses of the same group. In aim 2, we will identify and functionally characterize host proteins that bind to the 5’- and 3’-terminal ends of the dISF and MBFV genomes. Biotinylated RNAs containing the 5’ UTR, C gene, and 3’ UTR sequences of select dISFs and MBFVs will be transfected into mosquito and vertebrate cells. The cell cultures will be inoculated with virus then RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) will be recovered using streptavidin beads and identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. We will pinpoint the precise viral sequences that interact with RBPs of greatest interest by reversible RNA-protein crosslinking, immunoprecipitation, and RNAseq. Select RBPs will be further analyzed in overexpression and knockdown experiments to determine whether they are positive or negative regulators of viral replication. In aim 3, we will identify and functionally characterize host proteins that bind to NS3 and NS5 of select dISFs and MBFVs. A novel proximity-based protein labeling technique known as TurboID will be used to recover mosquito and vertebrate hosts that associate, either directly or indirectly, to NS3 and NS5 of the selected viruses. Recovered proteins will be identified by LC-MS/MS analysis and a subset will be characterized in overexpression and knockdown experiments to determine whether they enhance or suppress viral replication. Data generated from the experiments outlined in the aforementioned aims will allow us to define the genetic and molecular determinants of flavivirus host-specificity."

This Task Order is for the conduct of a Phase I clinical trial to test whether Dimethand.rolone undecanoate will be well tolerated and will suppress gonadotropins. Preliminary results from animal studies indicate that an oral dose of the drug has both progestin and androgen activity and will suppress gonadotropins sufficiently to a level that produces inhibition of spermatogenesis. 
Since this study is first in man, it is not known what dose of drug will be effective at suppression of gonadotropins or if the drug will be well tolerated. The study will test a single dose of drug in men and will continue with single doses of escalating strength assuming that the drug is well tolerated. The primary outcome will be to measure suppression of gonadotropins over the treatment period and to collect information about possible side effects."

The Gastrointestinal (GI) system engages the coordinated function of digestive organs, oxygenated blood supply, nutrient
processing and distribution, detoxification of noxious species, and sequestration of excess bioactive nutrients to maintain
homeostasis and respond to the body's nutrient bioavailability. Excess gastrointestinal-produced bioactive nutrients such
as glucose or fructose, precursors to many gastrointestinal-related diseases, pose a major burden and risk to the liver due
to increased hepatic metabolism physiologically designed to process and sequester excess bioactive nutrients within
designated tissues of the body. Excess glucose and fructose due to dysregulation and high sugar content diets are among
the many contributors to non-alcoholic fatty acid (NAFLD) pathogenesis with fructose having more potential impact on
the etiology of this disease than glucose since it is only metabolized in the liver. In addition, fructose metabolism to fatty
acid in the liver is far less regulated than its glucose counterpart. However, glucose being an isomer of fructose, will be
used as the model compound for the proposed approach of remediating and optimizing excesses of these two hexose
molecules (glucose and fructose) in the proximal small intestine. The objective of this research project is to determine the
optimal dynamics for excess glucose remediation via fibration in the proximal small intestine (SI) lumen. This will be
accomplished by Identifying and quantifying mechanisms of species transport and physicochemical transformation at the
proximal small intestine with a focus on glucose bioavailability optimization and excess regulation. Determine the optimal
rates of glucose fibration relative to other transport and metabolic reaction rates at the proximal small intestine. GI
systems use biophysical and biochemical mechanisms in coordinating species transport and transformation coupled with
interactions with the wall of the GI lumen. A systematic representation of these mechanisms will serve as a platform for
the development of a numerical model that can assist in glucose transport and transformation rate quantification in the
proximal SI. While also assessing the optimal rate of glucose condensation to dietary fiber (NDO) involving the
transglycosylase enzyme in the proximal SI. The processes guiding the optimal rate determination encompass both the
species transport in and out of the proximal SI and the series of species transformations in the same. A compartmental
metabolic rate model for the proximal SI and other supporting organs serving as peripheral compartments will be
developed to model glucose formation, consumption through transglycosylation, absorption, and regulation rates with the
focus of optimizing its bioavailability and regulating its excess through transglycosylation (NDO formation). The
numerical model for the quantification and analysis of the proposed metabolism mechanisms will be developed and solved
in MATLAB (and COMSOL Multiphysics as an alternative). This effort will create a systematic gastrointestinal tract
virtual laboratory platform where detailed species transport and transformation mechanisms can be readily assessed and
quantified. This modeling approach can leverage our understanding of many gastrointestinal pathophysiological
conditions connected to excess glucose in the body and provide a systematic approach to developing diagnostic
procedures and therapeutic prescriptions per disease of interest."
10936848,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury causes vocal fold motion impairments (e.g., vocal fold paralysis). The
inability to adduct (close) the vocal folds has consequences for airway protection during swallowing (deglutition)
and vocal communication. These laryngeal motor deficits result in increased risk of aspiration pneumonia and
have profound effects on vocal communication required for vocation, safety, and social encounters. The result
is also significant economic burden, psychosocial consequences, and reduced quality of life. Current surgical
approaches focus on medializing the vocal folds to improve glottic closure, but they do little to restore functional
mobility to the vocal fold muscles within the larynx. The key issue is that current treatments rarely recover vocal
fold movement after RLN injuries due to nerve synkinesis at the periphery and upstream corticobulbar somato-
topic disorganization after spontaneous reinnervation.
One solution is to reorganize upstream motor pathways in the central nervous system to improve downstream
restoration of laryngeal muscle function after RLN injury. Electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve has previously
been shown to release neuromodulators in the brain that excite task-specific neural circuits and down-regulate
less important circuits to improve motor input to the forelimb after median-ulnar nerve injury in a rat forelimb
injury model. Similarly, our preliminary data in a rat model of right RLN injury has shown that temporal pairing of
enhanced central neuromodulation in the brain with a motor-specific laryngeal behavior, like deglutition, may
also restore laryngeal motor function.
The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of neuromodulation-paired deglutition on recovery of
laryngeal motor function and central neuroplasticity in a rat model of RLN injury. Capitalizing on our promising
preliminary data, animals will be divided into one of three groups: enhanced neuromodulation paired with deglu-
tition, deglutition training only, and neuromodulation only. Enhanced neuromodulation outcomes across acute
and chronic RLN injury will be determined in Aim 1 and across ipsilateral and contralateral injury in Aim 2. Func-
tional effects of neuromodulation/deglutition combinations will be evaluated using laryngoscopy to quantify vocal
fold movement essential for airway protection and vocalization. We will also record ultrasonic vocalizations to
characterize changes in vocal intensity and tonality across the groups. Central neuroplastic effects will be eluci-
dated with retrograde tracing and somatotopic corticobulbar mapping. Effects of ipsilateral simulation on the RLN
will also be elucidated in Aim 2 using laryngeal muscle neuromuscular junction count and morphology analysis.
Expected outcomes will be known functional and mechanistic effects of neuromodulation-paired deglutition. Re-
sults will provide a springboard for novel treatment approaches for patients with RLN injury-induced laryngeal
motor impairments (e.g., vocal fold paralysis)."

The intricate orchestration of genetic and epigenetic dynamics in neurobiological systems plays a central role in
substance use disorders (SUDs), with cocaine use constituting a significant public health concern. This project
employs a cutting-edge, interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the epigenetic landscapes and gene regulatory
networks activated following cocaine self-administration in a mouse model, as well as to understand how
epigenetic variations influence these processes. The project comprises three core objectives at the intersection
of genomics, epigenomics, neuroscience, and computational biology. First, we will conduct high-resolution
chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation profiling to delineate cell-type and circuit-specific epigenetic
configurations post-cocaine self-administration in mice. This analysis aims to uncover granular alterations in the
epigenome, illuminating the regulatory pathways implicated in cocaine-induced neural plasticity and behavioral
adaptations. Second, we will leverage the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP), comprising approximately 100
different strains of mice, to investigate variances in epigenetic regulation. Utilizing the HMDP as a mechanistic
intermediary, we aim to identify epigenetic variations underlying strain-specific susceptibilities and resistances
to cocaine exposure, thus deepening our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors associated with
cocaine self-administration. Lastly, we will construct cell-type and circuit-specific gene regulatory networks that
encapsulate the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors. These networks will be established through rigorous
computational analyses that integrate genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data. In summary, this project
aims not only to detail regulatory dynamics but also to identify key nodes and pathways for potential therapeutic
intervention, representing a significant stride towards alleviating the global burden of cocaine use disorder. The
work pushes the boundaries of current epigenetic studies in SUDs by employing a multidimensional approach
to unravel the complex genetic and epigenetic landscapes governing cocaine response. The outcomes are
expected to fundamentally enhance our understanding and present unprecedented avenues for therapeutic
innovation."

In response to RFA-NS-24-015, we propose the University of Florida Partnerships Across Interdisciplinary
Networks: Training through Engineering, epidemiology & Addiction Medicine (UF PAIN TEAM) - a T90/R90
interdisciplinary postdoctoral program designed to train the next generation of independent clinical pain
researchers. Our UF PAIN TEAM training program is built on the unique strengths of our existing CTSI-developed
team training model, adding a pain science emphasis to clinical pain research training and integrating traditional
and non-traditional areas of pain research. We will also emphasize collaboration across the research continuum,
and further expand the scope of interdisciplinary clinical pain research to include disciplines not traditionally
represented in pain research. We will create a unique cohort experience by embedding authentic, collaborative
and interdisciplinary experiences in team science into each trainee’s research, preparing them to conduct team
science clinical pain research locally and across the broader HEAL PAIN Cohort Program. The proposed team
training approach for clinical pain research combines authentic didactic and experiential training in team
science; interdisciplinary mentoring that crosses academic barriers; scientific training across the entire
biopsychosocial model of pain; and career development mentoring that crosses academic disciplines. We will
provide extensive breadth and depth in training to i) 4 post-doctoral scientists (T90; PhD, Dual degree-PhD), and
ii) 1 non-citizen, non-permanent resident clinically-trained PhD holder (R90), that are seeking advanced post-
doctoral training in scientific areas designated as high priority by HEAL. These areas are pain across the lifespan,
nonpharmacological interventions for pain, non-opioid pharmacological treatments for pain, effective
interventions for pain and co-morbidities, impacts of social determinants of health on pain, and advancing health
equity in pain. To accomplish our goals, expert program faculty will provide extensive team training experiences.
Postdoctoral trainees will receive an initial commitment for appointments of two years, where 2 teams of trainees
will work together and develop their own collaborative projects involving disciplines traditionally and not
traditionally represented in clinical pain research. By implementing an integrated team training program, including
didactic, research, and professional development activities, we will equip trainees with new skills, knowledge,
and expertise to apply these skills in collaborative teams. We will also create a culture of responsible research
conduct and professional excellence to ensure that trainees aspire to the high standards of scientific integrity
and quality, which will set the tone for their future careers in clinical pain research. Finally, we will disseminate
elements of our team training model regionally and nationally via interdisciplinary communities of traditional and
non-traditional pain disciplines including the Annual HEAL PURPOSE Network. Collectively, these programs will
produce highly skilled, collaborative, and interactive scientists who can engage in team science to generate new
knowledge and translate discoveries to tangible advances in the prevention, treatment, and cure of chronic pain."

The evolutionary expansion of the brain along the primate lineage involved unequal scaling of
brain regions, with telencephalon size increasing dramatically more than that of midbrain and
hindbrain. Coupled with increased human lifespan, this reconfiguration of brain structures may
put undue burden on neurons whose target regions have expanded disproportionately. These
vulnerable “joints” include the small populations of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons that
project to vast target fields in the cortex and striatum and contribute to human-enriched disorders
such as Parkinson’s disease. In turn, human DA neurons may have evolved compensatory
neuroprotective mechanisms while adapting to supplying an enlarged telencephalon, but few
studies have examined the evolution of selective vulnerability or compensatory mechanisms in
the human lineage.
 We have designed an interdisciplinary approach to study human-specific properties of DA
neurons using interspecies stem cell-derived organoids, primary tissue from human, chimpanzee,
and rhesus macaque, machine learning approaches to genomics data, and functional analysis of
variants by CRISPR. Our approach will enable direct measurement of dynamic gene regulatory
responses and candidate protective pathways to age-related oxidative stress that cannot be
measured from post-mortem tissue alone. Convolutional neural nets will help decode a dynamic
regulatory grammar of oxidative stress responses, enabling predictions of the effects of all human-
specific variants. Interspecies tetraploid cell fusions further enable experimental analysis of the
effects of these variants in their native genomic context, with CRISPRi supporting further
validation. Finally, comparative loss of function screening in dopaminergic neurons exposed to
stress pathways will reveal conserved and human-specific genetic dependencies in these
vulnerable cell types.
 Through the successful completion of these studies, we will determine which genomic
elements and genetic changes underlie oxidative stress-dependent responses in dopaminergic
neurons laying the groundwork for further targeting these cellular protective mechanisms across
cell types and age-related stressors. Ultimately, this approach is generalizable to other age-
related stressors and vulnerable cell types."
10937167,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Trichotillomania (hair pulling) and excoriation (skin picking) disorder are debilitating, difficult-to-treat
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum conditions with no first-line pharmacologic interventions.
Previous work supports the role of shared genetic factors in the development of these body-focused repetitive
behaviors (BFRBs), but progress in identifying BFRB risk genes and biological pathways has been slow.
 The scientific objective of this K08 award application is to use a series of complementary, unbiased
state-of-art neurogenetic approaches to advance our understanding of the genes and pathways that underly
BFRBs, which is an important step towards developing improved treatments. Completion of this K08 proposal
will provide Dr. Olfson with critical new training in several key areas to achieve her long-term career goal of
becoming an independent investigator in neurogenomics. Our central hypothesis is that damaging DNA
sequence and structural variants are enriched in individuals with BFRBs compared to controls, and iSPC brain
organoids can shed light on convergent neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Guided by strong preliminary data
generated by Dr. Olfson from whole-exome DNA sequencing (WES) in BFRB parent-child trios, this hypothesis
will be examined in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we propose expanding our BFRB cohort to conduct WES in 200
parent-child trios. We will (i) compare de novo and rare inherited WES mutation rates between case and
control trios, (ii) examine shared sequence variant genetic risk across the OCD spectrum using 400 previously
sequenced OCD trios, and (iii) integrate systems analyses to identify biologic pathways, gene networks, and
expression patterns. In Aim 2, Dr. Olfson will develop new skills in analyzing copy-number variants (CNVs) by
conducting the first genome-wide CNV study of BFRB parent-child trios. We will (i) compare the de novo and
rare inherited CNV burden in the BFRB and control trios, (ii) examine CNVs across the OCD spectrum, and (iii)
integrate CNV data with results from Aim 1 for recurrence and enrichment in systems analyses. In Aim 3, Dr.
Olfson will expand her skill set in iPSC brain organoids to assess early neurodevelopmental mechanisms of
BFRBs. We will characterize iPSC brain organoids derived from 4 patients and unaffected sex-matched first-
degree relatives to compare (i) neural differentiation and (ii) transcriptomics by single-cell RNA-sequencing.
 Overall, this K08 proposal will not only improve our fundamental knowledge of BFRB neurobiology, but
also provide Dr. Olfson with vital training necessary to develop an independent neurogenomics research
program to continue her investigations of BFRBs and other neuropsychiatric conditions. This training plan
involves a multi-disciplinary mentoring team based primarily at the Yale Child Study Center with expertise in
genomics (Dr. Fernandez and Dr. Scharf), iSPC brain organoids (Dr. Vaccarino and Dr. Fernandez), and
BFRBs (Dr. Bloch and Dr. Scharf). Collectively, these mentors will provide Dr. Olfson with guidance and
support to ensure her success in becoming an independent physician-scientist in translational neurogenomics."

 Ethnic/racial minorities (ERMs) are more likely to suffer from short sleep duration and poor sleep quality
relative to Whites. Sociodemographic and environmental stressors disproportionately impact ERMs and have
been implicated in the development and maintenance of race-related sleep disparities. The transition to college
is an especially important time to investigate sleep since young adults encounter a unique configuration of
sociodemographic and environmental stressors linked to sleep. No longer tethered to early high school start
times, college students report later and more irregular bedtimes. College students also sleep less and more
poorly than adults, suggesting a developmental peak in sleep disturbances among young adults.
 Focusing on two sleep-vulnerable groups – ERMs and college students - this 5-year longitudinal study
investigates race-related sleep disparities in a diverse sample of college students during and after the
transition to college; and how race-related sleep disparities forecast downstream health and academic
outcomes through students’ senior year. The study also investigates the risk and protective effects of
ethnic/racial identity as a dynamic and changing moderator during this period.
 The innovative and novel combination of daily diaries and sleep actigraphy, biannual surveys, and annual
assessments of inflammatory biomarkers, telomere length and anthropometric measures offers an unparalleled
opportunity to investigate the daily and longer-term mechanisms, pathways, and consequences of race-related
sleep disparities in a large sample of ERM and White college students. A key innovation of the study is the
intersectional inclusion of ERM, socioeconomic, 1st-generation college, resident and commuter diversity. The
three specific aims of the study are informed by strong preliminary data (R21MD011388), scientific premise,
and the race-based disparities in stress and sleep in context model. The proposed study:
1. Determines the daily and longer-term impact of sociodemographic and environmental stress on race-
 related sleep disparities (duration, quality, regularity) during the college transition and the next four years
2. Identifies race-related sleep disparities as an explanatory pathway for sociodemographic and
 environmental stress to impact health, academic and physiologic biomarker (inflammation and telomere
 length) outcomes
3. Investigates ethnic/racial identity as a dynamic moderator of the daily and longer-term effects of stress on
 sleep, and of sleep on outcomes
Together, these aims advance developmental and health equity science, investigating how sociodemographic
and environmental stress contribute to race-related sleep disparities among diverse college students to
forecast daily and longer-term health and academics over time."

Neuroinflammation is a critical component of trauma-induced secondary injury that is capable of mediating the
production of Aβ plaques commonly seen in dementia-like neurological sequela. The epidemiological link
between TBI and dementia is well supported with TBI patients having an increased lifelong risk of developing
dementia. One of the earliest observable pathologies in the AD brain is a global reduction in CBF, and our novel
preliminary findings suggest that reduced CBF is associated with substantial vascular Aβ plaque accumulation
in the pial layer of the cranial meninges of J20 (PDGF-APPSw, Ind) mice that we discovered is uniquely restricted
to the pial arterial vascular network. Recent scRNAseq studies show inflammatory gene alterations in meningeal
macrophages following mild TBI (mTBI). It remains unknown whether chronic meningeal inflammation following
brain injury in aged individuals can contribute to neurodegenerative sequela. The parent grant has established
that the EphA4/Tie2 axis regulates the inflammatory state of monocyte/macrophages and that BMC chimeric
loss of EphA4 reduces TBI deficits. The objective of this supplement is to characterize the mechanism(s)
underlying chronic meningeal inflammation and establish whether Aβ plaque deposition is accelerated in J20
mice following mTBI. We will further establish these longitudinal effects in a sex-specific manner using GFP BMC
chimeric approaches. We hypothesize that EphA4 supports a chronic pro-inflammatory environment in the
meninges leading to vascular Aβ plaque accumulation and cognitive deficits in J20 mice that are accelerated
following mTBI. This study will highlight the pathophysiological relevance of the novel Aβ plaque meningeal
phenotype and establish whether peripheral immune cells are involved in this process."
10937435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – In patients with gastric cancers who are clinically classified as HER2-
positive, antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) prolong progression-free and overall survival. However, not all
gastric tumors benefit from these therapies, or even those who initially respond inevitably develop resistance
over time. Complementary biomarkers and methods are therefore needed to identify patients that will respond
or develop resistance to HER2-targeting ADC therapies. Preclinical data we obtained in HER2 heterogeneous
gastric patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) demonstrate that tumoral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor
(S1PR1) associate with tumors’ response to ADCs. Here, we will validate a S1PR1-targeted imaging approach
(that is already used in the clinics for non-cancer applications) that allows quantitative measurements of
S1PR1 to evaluate the early response to ADC treatment in mouse models of gastric cancer. We will correlate
HER2 membrane availability, tumoral S1PR1, and the presence of genetic alterations with gastric tumor
response to ADCs. We will perform randomized imaging and therapeutic studies in gastric PDXs to identify
biological features that confer tumor sensitivity and resistance to ADCs. Aim 1 will use molecular imaging
approaches involving positron emission tomography (PET) to further investigate the role of S1PR1 in ADC
efficacy. Our innovative approach can quantitatively measure ADC-tumor binding through immunoPET and
S1PR1 through a radiolabeled small molecule in the same subject and in real-time in gastric PDXs. Our
studies will show that our imaging approaches, combined with analyses at the tissue level, can quantitatively
detect different levels of early response to ADC therapy in gastric tumors, providing a strong impact. Aim 2 will
further establish PET to determine the potential of modulating tumoral S1PR1 to reverse ADC resistance in
gastric tumors. We will measure changes in HER2 and S1PR1 in response to treatments that enhance ADC
efficacy. For each study, we will correlate the magnitudes of changes in our imaging biomarkers to a longer-
term therapeutic outcome, as well as determine which combinations of multiple biomarkers improve the
evaluation of early treatment response. This project could provide an excellent foundation for many future
investigations, including the clinical translation of PET imaging approaches to predict and monitor tumor
response to ADCs and the potential broader application to other membrane receptors and heterogeneous
tumors. The long-term translational objectives of the studies proposed are to establish a foundation for a
clinical study using imaging approaches of antibody-tumor accumulation and S1PR1 as predictive biomarkers
of tumors response to HER2-targeting antibody drugs."

More than a million of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI) occur in the US every year. HAIs affect about one
in 30 patients, which makes them the leading risk for morbidity and mortality associated with medical care.
Transmission of the infections occurs thorough various routs, with about 30% of transmissions occurring through
frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles, elevator buttons, light switches, etc. This, frequently touched
surfaces in healthcare settings require regular and thorough cleaning and disinfection.
The use of commercially available disinfectants significantly reduces microbial counts on environmental surfaces
for only up to 4 hours after treatment. An alcohol-based disinfectant with a compound capable of forming a
durable biocidal film that could slowly release an antimicrobial active ingredient could combine high short-term
efficacy due to the presence of alcohol and prevent microbial re-contamination due to the long-lasting efficacy
of the film, while requiring less frequent applications.
VRM Labs has recently developed such disinfectant, which contains 3 wt. % chitosan, 60 % wt. ethanol, and a
natural active antimicrobial, sandalwood seed oil. Chitosan is obtained from crustacean shells and its
antimicrobial and antiviral efficacy is well-established. However, it has not been used in surface disinfectants
because of high viscosity of its aqueous solutions and long drying times required to form a continuous film. Our
proposed formulation has low viscosity, outstanding film-forming properties and drying time similar to that for
currently used disinfectants. During the Phase I study, frequently touched surfaces treated by this novel
formulation completely prevented microbial growth for up to 72 hours after treatment. This natural formulation
outperformed currently available synthetic disinfectant Microban24 which showed 24 h compete protection in the
same trial.
The goal of the proposed Phase II grant is to collect comprehensive data required for regulatory approval and
customer acceptance of this product and develop scaled up manufacturing to make this product
commercialization ready. During the proposed study, we will optimize the composition of the formulation (Aim I)
and perform comprehensive toxicity and efficacy studies required for the regulatory approval (Aim II). We will
also perform a multi-site filed study of the efficacy of our product on frequently touched environmental surfaces
in two hospitals in the Midwest (Cleveland Clinic, OH) and in the Southeast (Prisma Health, SC) (Aim III). Finally,
we will undertake a scaling up in collaboration with the largest domestic chitosan manufacturer, Tidal Vision
USA."

10940436,"Summary/Abstract for the Supplement
 We are requesting a supplement to our NIAAA R01 (R01AA029688) entitled “A Framework for
Translating Polygenic Findings Related to Alcohol Use Disorder Across Species”. This supplement request is
in response to NOT-AG-23-032. The start date of the parent grant is September 16, 2022, and the end date is
August 31, 2027. Consistent with NOT-AG-23-032, our proposal will “examine the fundamental mechanism
underlying alcohol effects on the vulnerability to the cognitive impairments associated with dementias”.
 There is a well established link between alcohol consumption and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In
particular, heavy drinking increases the risk for developing AD. One possible explanation is that alcohol
exposure drives this correlation, but another possibility is that the genetic risk for alcohol consumption and/or
alcohol use disorder (AUD) contributes to the risk for developing AD due to the genetic risk for high alcohol
consumption or AUD, even in the absence of exposure to alcohol. These issues are difficult or impossible to
disentangle in humans because their exposure to both alcohol and other known and unknown environmental
exposures relevant to AD is governed by both direct and indirect genetic effects as well as complicated genetic
population structure which is itself correlated with environmental exposures that may influence both AD and
AUD. Therefore, an experimental system is needed. However, currently available AD animal models tend to
focus on a few highly penetrant alleles, which are not the primary drivers of human AD, and thus do not model
the highly polygenic AD risk that is responsible for the majority of the disease burden.
 We are proposing to address this important knowledge gap by using a sophisticated statistical genetic
approach. We will use the polygenic transcriptomic risk score (PTRS) method, which is the focus of the parent
grant, to predict the “Rat Alzheimer’s Disease Associated Risk” (RADAR) score for all 1,250 HS rats being
phenotyped in the parent grant. We will examine correlations between RADAR scores and the measures of
alcohol dependence, withdrawal and sensitivity being collected in the parent grant. This will allow us to assess
the genetic relationship between AD and behavioral measures relevant to AUD in an experimental system that
does not suffer from the many confounds that limit the interpretations of human genetic data on the relationship
between AD and AUD."

The long-term goal of our research project is to define mechanisms that govern the development and
maintenance of motor neurons, as well as the formation and maturation of the synaptic connection between
the motor neuron and the skeletal muscle - the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).
The mammalian NMJ is a classic model of cholinergic synapses; it contains all elements of cholinergic
synapses, including the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and the ACh receptor (acetylcholine receptor,
AChR), as well as the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis and degradation of ACh, choline acetyltransferase
(ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), respectively. We use the NMJ as a model for understanding
synapses as it can provide information pertinent to both peripheral and central synapses. Its relatively simple
structure and easy accessibility make it more amenable to investigation than those of the central nervous
system (CNS). Furthermore, the NMJ has a significant advantage over the CNS because genes can be
deleted separately in the pre verses post-synaptic compartment, thereby facilitating the study of compartment-
specific functions.
This project addresses a fundamental question in the interaction between the nerve and the muscle – how
does muscle signal to the nerve to promote motor neuron survival, and to regulate synapse formation and
maturation? Using targeted gene deletions in mice, we found that muscle activity, mediated through muscle
dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) and a newly identified protein, STAC3 (SH3 and cysteine-rich domain-
containing protein 3), plays a key role in regulating motor neurons and the NMJ. Like DHPR, STAC3 is
localized at the T-tubules and is required for excitation contraction coupling in skeletal muscles. Our
preliminary findings open a new avenue of investigation for identifying feedback mechanisms from the muscle
to the nerve, and will provide important insights supporting future development of therapeutic strategies to
prevent motor neuron loss and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)."

10912676,"COAST Abstract
Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is managed primarily with topical medical therapy, with laser and surgical
interventions reserved for those in whom medical therapy is ineffective, intolerable, or inappropriate. The
effectiveness of medical therapy is limited by patient adherence with therapy; inadequate adherence has been
extensively documented. Selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) has comparable efficacy to preferred first-line
prostaglandin analogues, is very safe, and obviates the need for daily medical therapy in most patients when
applied as primary therapy. A recent randomized trial demonstrated superior glaucoma outcomes (less
progression, fewer surgeries required) in newly diagnosed OAG patients receiving primary SLT vs. medical
therapy, providing the evidentiary basis for a paradigm shift that is already underway in which SLT supplants
medical therapy as the preferred first-line treatment for OAG. SLT is largely performed as first described by its
inventor; little exploration of dose-response has been undertaken. An intriguing data set from Italy (with
significant weaknesses and limitations) suggests that low energy SLT repeated annually is far more effective
than standard SLT repeated as needed when its effect wanes, in delaying or preventing the need for topical
medical therapy. This finding is consistent with the limited data exploring the dose-response relationship
between SLT and intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction. Further, it is biologically plausible that ongoing health
maintenance of trabecular meshwork (TM) function with proactive annual low energy SLT would better
preserve the TM's long-term health and function than a repeated cycle of SLT, progressive TM re-impairment
by the glaucoma process, loss of IOP control, and repeat SLT. Our proposal describes a multi-center clinical
trial to answer two key questions: 1) Is primary low energy SLT as effective as primary standard energy SLT in
newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with mild-moderate OAH or high-risk ocular hypertension?; and
2) Does annual low energy repeat SLT more effectively delay or prevent the need for medical therapy
compared to standard SLT repeated as needed when its effect wanes and IOP rises? Participants will be
randomized to initial standard SLT or initial low energy SLT with the possibility of a single repeat SLT as
needed in the first year of the study. The first primary outcome will be 12-month survival where failure
represents the need for repeat SLT to achieve/maintain protocol-specified target IOP. At Month 12, all
participants who remain medication-free will be re-randomized to undergo repeat SLT either as needed when
IOP exceeds target IOP (at initially randomized energy) or to annual low energy SLT irrespective of IOP. The
second primary outcome will be 42-month medication-free survival in subjects who were medication-free at
Month 12. Our study seeks to clarify the optimal way to utilize SLT with the ultimate goal of maximizing long-
term SLT responsiveness and medication-free survival. If successful, our results will shape the course of
treatment for most newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with mild-moderate OAG or high-risk OHT."
10914021,"The proposed research explores the structure and mechanism of terpene cyclases, which are unique
among enzymes in that they catalyze the most complex carbon-carbon bond forming reactions in nature: on
average, more than half of the substrate carbon atoms undergo changes in bonding and/or hybridization during
the course of a typical enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Notably, many terpenoids exhibit useful pharmacological
properties, such as the blockbuster cancer chemotherapy drug Taxol (paclitaxel) and the antimalarial drug
artemisinin. Thus, a better understanding of terpene cyclase structure and mechanism will enable drug
discovery and manufacturing at the interface of natural products chemistry, enzymology, structural biology, and
synthetic biology. To advance our understanding of structure-function relationships in terpene cyclases, we will
pursue the following lines of investigation:
 (1) We will determine the structural basis of substrate binding, transit, and catalysis in a class I assembly-
line terpene synthase, fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdali (PaFS). We will determine cryo-EM
structures of PaFS complexes with an inhibitor and with a substrate analogue, and we will determine the
influence of oligomeric structure as well as the interdomain linker on substrate channeling between the
prenyltransferase and cyclase domains. These studies will broaden our understanding of substrate channeling
– perhaps better designated as ""directed substrate transit"" – between covalently-linked enzymes catalyzing
consecutive reactions in a biosynthetic pathway.
 (2) We will determine the structural basis of substrate binding, transit, and catalysis in class II assembly-
line terpene synthases, the copalyl diphosphate synthases from Penicillium verruculosum (PvCPS) and
Penicillium fellutanum (PfCPS). We will complete the cryo-EM structure determination of PfCPS, and we will
determine the cryo-EM structures of its complexes with a substrate analogue and product. We will also
determine whether directed substrate transit occurs between the prenyltransferase and cyclase domains in
both PfCPS and PvCPS, and we will ascertain the importance of oligomeric structure for catalytic function.
 (3) We will explore and exploit the structural basis of chemodiversity in terpene biosynthesis, focusing on
sesquiterpene synthases that quench reactive carbocation intermediates with hydroxyl or amino nucleophiles.
We will convert our paradigm for protein engineering, epi-isozizaene synthase, into a sesquiterpene alcohol
synthase. We will also determine structure-function relationships for the sesquiterpene synthase FlvF from
Aspergillus flavus to understand how it catalyzes the condensation of a cyclic sesquiterpene with
dimethylcadaverine. Importantly, FlvF represents the first example of a synthase that catalyzes C–N bond
formation with a cyclic terpene."
10914119,"SUMMARY
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is almost always preceded by early precursor conditions: monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM). About 3% of the population >50 years
have MGUS, making it a very common precursor condition. The risk is 2-3 times higher in people with a family
history of MM or who are Black/African American (AA). Here, we believe that instead of defining risk by race and
familial history only, we will define risk as specific genomic signatures, some of which are related to race. By
screening at-risk populations for MGUS, one can develop early prevention and interception strategies for patients
who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions. Our preliminary data identified an MGUS prevalence of
~13% in high-risk populations; the data came from two sources: our prospective cohort study (the PROMISE
study) that is screening 30,000 participants at-risk of developing MM and a large retrospective tissue banking
study, the Mass-General Brigham (MGB) biobank, with 123,000 subjects. However, what is lacking is the
identification of biological cancer risk mechanisms in MM and translating these discoveries into cancer
interception and early therapeutic interventions. This approach will allow the field to transition from a purely
demographic definition of risk to a biological one. We believe that samples from the PLCO study, along with our
current study cohorts, can help define the mechanistic underpinnings of the carcinogenesis process leading to
MGUS/MM. Our overarching hypothesis is that defining the risk of developing MM precursors at the
genomic level can more precisely identify specific populations at risk than demographic attributes and
define focused strategies for early interception. In Specific Aim 1, we define the prevalence of monoclonal
gammopathies in high-risk participants in the PLCO study along with MGB/PROMISE cohorts and characterize
their impact on long-term health outcomes. In Specific Aim 2, we identify germline variants that predispose to
developing MGUS/MM. We aim to characterize the genetic underpinnings of risk related to race and family
history of disease. We expect that this approach will allow us to move past using self-reported race status for
risk stratification. In Specific Aim 3, we assess the role of immune aging in developing MGUS/MM. MM is
traditionally thought of as a disease of the elderly, but the risk may be better explained by the ""aging tissue"" of
origin rather than chronological age.
This approach will allow us to transition from a purely demographic definition
of risk to a biological one."
10914122,"Summary
Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the
effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of
phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid
conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor
behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor).
Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of
the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text
has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to
treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer
deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has
been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software,
and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational
investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell
Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for
extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The
proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with
emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent
calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing
phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research."

10914638,"Abstract.
Background: Suicide prevention is VHA’s highest priority. While VHA has responded by implementing new
screening requirements, the REACH VET machine-learning program to identify those at high risk, and new
clinical practice guidelines, these approaches do not provide Veterans at highest suicide risk with “indicated”
strategies, such as psychotherapy that specifically targets suicide attempts. Reducing Veteran suicide attempts
requires addressing underlying transdiagnostic psychological processes. Emotion dysregulation, or difficulty
managing emotions, occurs across mental health diagnoses and is associated with higher suicide risk.
Developing emotion regulation skills is a key element of effective suicide prevention. Dialectical behavior
therapy (DBT) is a well-established, multi-component, evidence-based suicide prevention psychotherapy
targeting emotion dysregulation that is not widely available at VHA given the complexities of implementing it. A
resource-efficient, group-delivered suicide prevention psychotherapy, DBT Skills Group (DBT-SG), has been
associated with reduced suicidal ideation and emotion dysregulation in VHA and non-VHA samples and was
as effective as full-scale DBT in reducing suicide attempt and ideation in a non-VHA study of individuals with
high suicide risk. We propose a hybrid type 1 trial to 1) evaluate the effectiveness of DBT-SG in a
transdiagnostic sample of Veterans at high risk for suicide, and 2) identify individual and organizational barriers
and facilitators for DBT-SG adoption in VHA facilities. Significance/ Impact: Studying DBT-SG’s clinical
effectiveness and factors affecting its implementation align with the OMHSP’s National Strategy for Preventing
Veteran Suicide, HSR&D, and legislative priorities to evaluate innovative interventions in high risk Veteran
populations, and new VHA Clinical Practice Guidelines that encourage transdiagnostic research on DBT
approaches for high-risk Veterans. Innovation: This study fills VHA and national research gaps: it is the first
multisite trial to test the effectiveness of DBT-SG at VHA while simultaneously gathering generalizable
knowledge about implementation barriers and facilitators. Outcomes on clinical effectiveness and barriers and
facilitators will be used by OMHSP Psychotherapy and Suicide Prevention offices to inform ongoing suicide
prevention initiatives. Specific Aims: (1) Test the effectiveness of DBT-SG compared to treatment-as-usual
(TAU) to reduce suicide attempt and ideation in a multisite randomized trial at 4 VAMC’s; (2) Conduct a 3-part,
mixed-methods formative evaluation to identify potential facilitators and barriers to DBT-SG’s successful
adoption in VHA facilities. Methodology: We will randomize N=254 Veterans across 4 VAMC’s with recent
suicide attempt and emotion dysregulation to DBT-SG + TAU or TAU alone to evaluate DBT-SG effectiveness.
We hypothesize that DBT-SG, relative to TAU, will be associated with (H1a, primary outcome) reduced suicide
attempt during 18-month follow-up, (H2b) increased survival time for suicide attempt, and (H2c) reduced
suicidal ideation. Exploratory analyses will assess change in emotion dysregulation and coping skills. In
addition, before, during and after the trial, we will conduct a mixed-method formative evaluation, guided by the
Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework, to identify
DBT-SG implementation barriers and facilitators. At each juncture, we will seek input from 60 key clinical and
administrative stakeholders drawn from VHA national and local leadership, VHA clinicians, and Veterans at
high risk for suicide. Implementation/Next Steps: Effectiveness trial data about the prevention or delay of
suicide attempts will determine the appropriateness of DBT-SG for more widespread VHA implementation. If
DBT-SG is effective, the 3-part formative evaluation data will be used to develop a national VA DBT-SG
implementation strategy with OMHSP’s Psychotherapy Office as the operations partner. In each project year,
we will disseminate study findings to Veterans, VHA clinicians, and VHA local and national leadership."
10935661,"OVERALL PROGRAM SUMMARY: Mucus-degrading intestinal bacteria and toxicities of hematopoietic
cell transplantation
 The microbial community (microbiota) in the human gut plays a central role in digestion of dietary fiber,
providing nutrients to the gut microbiota as well as to the host through fermentation products like short-chain
fatty acids. A minority of gut bacteria can also utilize nutrients derived from mucus, a complex mixture of
secreted, mucin glycoproteins that form a layer over the epithelium to protect it from microbial encroachment.
The most abundant mucin utilizers are members of the genera Akkermansia and Bacteroides.
 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) is an important treatment modality performed
for a variety of benign and malignant hematological conditions. Patients receive systemic cytotoxic
conditioning, followed by infusion of allogeneic hematopoietic cells. In two recent manuscripts co-authored by
the Program Project Grant (PPG) Project and Core leaders, mucin-utilizing intestinal bacteria were found to
contribute to intestinal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that is aggravated by meropenem antibiotic
treatment, and neutropenic fever (NF).
 This is a revised PPG proposal with 3 integrated projects addressing how mucin-utilizing intestinal
bacteria contribute to intestinal GVHD. Recent preliminary data from experiments performed in mice identified
that Akkermansia and Bacteroides combine to compromise the colonic mucus layer, produce hypothermia in
models of HCT conditioning, and aggravate intestinal GVHD. The Projects of this PPG will extend these
findings, improving our understanding of how diet and metabolism modulate expression of mucin-degrading
enzymes in Akkermansia and Bacteroides.
 Project 1 builds upon expertise in clinical allo HCT microbiome profiling and preclinical modeling to
develop translational approaches. Project 2 incorporates an understanding of the natural landscape of
Akkermansia genetic heterogeneity, coupled with an extensive library of functional Akkermansia mutants to
deeply characterize the role of Akkermansia in intestinal GVHD. Finally, Project 3 offers a comprehensive
analysis of the effects of specific dietary glycans on mucin-degrading Bacteroides and genetic underpinnings
regulating expression of mucin-degrading enzymes.
 Supporting these are 2 unique cores. Core A will provide administrative services, microbiome-
specialized biostatistical support, clinical specimen and data collection from patients undergoing allo HCT at
two centers, and bionutritional support for collection of dietary data supplemented by metagenomic sequencing
of fecal chloroplast DNA. Core B will perform random and targeted bacterial mutagenesis to support high
throughput mutant screens as well as testing specific hypotheses, generate fluorescently labelled glycans to
visualize glycan uptake and degradation at the single cell level, and build a database of mucin-degrading
bacterial enzymes that will serve as a resource for the intestinal microbiome community."
10935662,"SUMMARY CORE A: Administrative, Biostatistics, Clinical and Bionutrition Core
The Administrative, Biostatistics, Clinical and Bionutrition Core of this revised application will
provide scientific leadership, effective communication and budgetary and logistical support to
ensure the coordinated success of all Program Project activities. It will importantly also provide
specialized biostatistical and bionutritional expertise as well as perform the service of collecting
patient biospecimens and clinical data to support each of the three individual Projects. This
proposal seeks to build upon our established collaborative efforts and complementary expertise
of the Project and Core PIs, focusing on improving our understanding of how mucin-degrading
intestinal bacteria can aggravate HCT toxicities and developing novel therapeutics to target
mucin-degrading activity. Our goal in this funding period will be to lay the foundation and enable
clinical interventional studies that will evaluate novel strategies to reduce intestinal GVHD. Key
activities of this core include: administrative support for all of the investigators in each project
and core; fiscal management and oversight for each of the Projects and Cores; organization,
planning, and communication of Program Project meetings and activities, including internal and
external advisory board meetings. The overall goal of this Core is effective and efficient
leadership of the P01. The roles of the Director, Co-investigators and administrative staff are to
enable communication and provide an organizational structure while facilitating scientific,
technological and logistical interactions. In order to achieve this goal, the core has established
four objectives: (1) to coordinate interactions among key personnel in Projects and Cores,
internal and external advisory boards, and NHLBI personnel regarding effective implementation
of proposed objectives; (2) to provide biostatistical support for patient biospecimen analyses, as
well as in vitro and in vivo experiments and implement plans to enable data sharing; (3) to
oversee the clinical biospecimen and data collection from HCT patients at MD Anderson and
Duke; and (4) to provide bionutritional expertise for real time data collection from patients, data
analysis, and experimental approaches."

Overall
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma (MM) are diseases of the elderly, with median incidence
of disease beyond 60 years of age. The mainstay of curative therapy for adult acute leukemia over the last two
decades in younger patients has been allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation (hereafter referred
to as HCT) but relapse remains the major limitation. MM has no traditional curative therapeutic options and
induction therapy is typically consolidated with autologous stem cell transplantation to prolong progression free
survival. However, relapse is largely inevitable. BCMA-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells induce
very high initial responses in relapsed/refractory MM but again, relapse dominates the clinical course of most
patients. T cell receptor transgenic (TCR Tg) T cells have recently shown promise in the prevention and
treatment of AML relapse after HCT. Unfortunately these Adoptive Cell Therapies (ACT) are also limited by
opportunistic infection and immune toxicity, namely graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after HCT, and Cytokine
Release Syndrome (CRS) after CAR T cell therapy. Project 1 of this Adult Leukemia Research Center (ALC)
grant seeks to understand the immunological underpinnings of immune toxicity and pathogen / leukemia and
myeloma specific immunity after ACT in preclinical systems, modelling the clinical studies within projects 2 and
3 in order to define innovative new approaches to prevent relapse and infection. In Project 2, we will design
and test new synthetic receptors that target MM antigens (Ag) with greater sensitivity and evaluate a novel
approach for incorporating co-stimulation to augment and sustain T cell function. Relapse is frequently
associated with loss of CAR T persistence and we will test a strategy that enriches memory stem cell
phenotypes in engineered T cells to improve persistence and potency. Finally, we will interrogate a rich
resource of samples from BCMA CAR T treated patients using high dimensional analysis to identify additional
tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms associated with relapse that would inform further innovations to
improve outcomes. Project 3 will study the ability and mechanisms by which a new generation of TCR Tg T
cell targeting the Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) protein may prevent relapse in patients with high risk AML in patients
who are not candidates for HCT. All clinical studies will be accompanied by high dimensional analysis of
immune factors governing treatment success and failure. These highly interactive projects will be supported by
Administration, Biostatistics and Data Management, High Dimensional Cellular and Spatial Analysis
and Long Term Follow Up cores. This P01 renewal will bring together innovative preclinical and clinical
mechanistic studies underpinning novel transplant and T cell engineering platforms aimed at overcoming
current cell therapy limitations, namely toxicity and relapse. The program will thus aim to bring a new
generation of safer, more effective cellular therapeutics to patients with acute leukemia and related
hematological malignancies within phase I/II clinical studies."

The NeuroImaging Tools and Resources Collaboratory (NITRC) is an established and award-winning (2009
Excellence.gov award and 2015 HHS Innovates award) repository of information and support for resources
relevant to a broad set of neuroimaging domains and their communities of developers and users. Resources
hosted on NITRC Resources (NITRC-R) include software, hardware, and test datasets; data sets are hosted
publicly in NITRC Image Repository (NITRC-IR), and cloud-based virtual computational processing is provided
by NITRC Computational Environment (NITRC-CE). The purpose of NITRC is to provide neuroscience
researchers with a complete solution to the problem of finding, developing, and sharing neuroimaging and
neuroinformatics software tools, finding and sharing large-scale imaging datasets, and manipulating the
software and the data in high-performance computing environments. NITRC will continue to be a framework
where researchers can identify software and data and seamlessly deliver them to local or cloud-based
computational resources for processing. This will be accomplished through the execution of aims designed to
provide: 1) Content and user maintenance for the established NITRC-R, IR and CE environments; 2)
infrastructure maintenance for the complete development and deployment environments; 3) content expansion
in the existing domains, and identification of new areas that are amenable to NITRC support; and 4) outreach,
user documentation, training, and support for the established NITRC user base. This continued effort will
greatly enhance the delivery of high-performance computing to the large-scale datasets that are becoming the
mainstay of neuroscience research and promote more reproducible publication practices through enhanced
resource sharing."
10902625,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Errors in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy, a hallmark of cancer. While we know nearly all
molecules involved in mammalian cell division, we do not understand how they work together to give rise to the
anaphase spindle’s mechanical function, or how molecular changes in disease impact spindle mechanics. This
is the big picture question that drives my work.
 This proposal aims to define the impact of protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) overexpression on
mammalian spindle mechanics. PRC1 crosslinks microtubules to form antiparallel bundles (bridging fibers) which
are involved in spindle formation, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis. Recent work revealed that PRC1
overexpression in cancer correlates with increased proliferation, chromosomal instability, and drug resistance.
Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how overexpression impacts proper PRC1 and spindle function is missing.
While in vivo studies have begun to uncover PRC1’s and bridging fibers’ functions, their underlying mechanics
remain poorly understood. Indeed, mechanical perturbations are challenging in vivo and mammalian spindles
cannot yet be reconstituted in vitro. To bridge this gap, our lab has recently adapted biophysical tools to probe
mammalian metaphase spindle mechanics in vivo, which I have tuned to probe anaphase mechanics.
 The anaphase spindle’s ability to effectively generate force while also deforming over minutes stems from
its tight control over the dynamics and mechanics of its bridging fibers, and of the overall spindle. Here, I propose
to determine how PRC1 overexpression disrupts these dynamics and mechanics and impacts the structural
integrity of spindles in cancer. I hypothesize that PRC1 overexpression will produce an overall less dynamic and
deformable spindle structure. Such behavior would provide insight into why PRC1 overexpression is correlated
with increased chromosomal instability in cancer. In Aim 1, I will test how bridging fiber microtubule lifetime and
protein kinetics change in response to PRC1 overexpression. I will assess dynamics using live imaging of
fluorescently tagged proteins. In Aim 2, I will test how anaphase bridging fibers alter their expansionary sliding
behavior in response to applied forces of differing velocities, and how this response changes with PRC1
overexpression. I will apply forces via microneedle manipulation and measure sliding using photoactivatable
tubulin marks. In Aim 3, I will determine how PRC1 overexpression impacts overall spindle integrity in healthy
cells and cancer cells with natural PRC1 overexpression. I will use PDMS-based cell confinement to apply
extracellular force and measure the rate of spindle fracturing events. I will overexpress PRC1 in a non-cancer
line to test sufficiency and use siRNA to deplete it in a cancer cell line to test necessity.
 Together, this work will reveal basic physical principles driving robust anaphase spindle mechanics and may
help uncover how accurate chromosome segregation breaks down in cancer cells overexpressing PRC1."
10902690,"Walking impairment is one of the most prevalent and life-altering consequences of multiple sclerosis (MS),
even in the early stages of the disease, and often co-occurs with an increase in the oxygen (O2) cost of
walking. The O2 cost of walking is the amount of O2 consumed per kilogram of body weight per unit distance
traveled and reflects the physiologic strain or burden of ambulation. This physiological measure of walking
dysfunction is 2-3 times higher in persons with MS than adults from the general population and compromises
free-living, community participation. The higher O2 cost of walking further causes early onset of fatigue, hinders
the performance of tasks necessary for daily living, and has been linearly associated with worse disability
status in MS. This is noteworthy, as a primary determinant of disability status and progression in MS includes
cardiovascular comorbidity. Of note, aerobic capacity, a primary indicator of cardiovascular function, has been
identified as a strong correlate of O2 cost of walking in persons with MS who have moderate disability.
Consequently, the logical next step in this line of research involves identifying potential physiological
mechanisms that underlie elevated O2 cost of walking, and vascular function and peripheral blood flow
represent the logical starting points based on associations with aerobic capacity and muscle function.
Vasodilatory capacity of arteries is necessary for appropriate peripheral blood flow delivery and O2 extraction
within the active muscle. Vascular function is typically assessed in the upper limbs (i.e., brachial artery), but
vascular dysfunction of the upper limbs may not be indicative of vascular dysfunction of the lower limbs. This
cross-sectional, comparative study will use non-invasive methods to compare vascular function (i.e., muscle
blood flow and oxygenation) of the lower limbs (i.e., popliteal artery) between persons with MS and controls
matched by age and sex, and then examine markers of vascular function as possible modifiable correlates of
O2 cost of walking in MS. The first aim is to compare the O2 cost of walking and lower-limb muscle blood flow
and oxygenation between persons with MS and controls. We hypothesize persons with MS will demonstrate
higher O2 cost of walking and lower muscle blood flow and oxygenation in the gastrocnemius muscle
compared with controls. The second aim is to examine the associations among the O2 cost of walking, lower-
limb muscle blood flow and oxygenation, and aerobic capacity in persons with MS and controls, controlling for
physical activity. We hypothesize that vascular outcomes, and secondarily aerobic capacity and physical
activity, will account for the difference in the O2 cost of walking between groups. This research may identify
specific underlying vascular mechanisms that explain the poor walking efficiency in MS and guide the design of
targeted approaches for improving walking efficiency and its consequences to promote health and better
overall quality of life. This research aligns with the PI’s research agenda of helping persons with neurological
conditions reintegrate into the community post-diagnosis through improvements in walking efficiency."
10903156,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 From the moment of giving birth, a mother must quickly adapt to the new demands of motherhood, attending
to signals from her offspring and using them to inform her behavior. The brain’s adaptability to motherhood is of
the utmost importance: inappropriate responses to infant cues can negatively affect not only infant outcomes,
but also the mother’s mental health. Maladaptive responses to infant cues have been associated with
neurological changes impacting motherhood, such as those that lead to poor mother-infant bonding and
postpartum depression (PPD). Paving the way for the development of novel predictors and therapeutics for such
conditions, animal research has begun to disentangle innate and learned components of the neural circuitry
underlying maternal responses to infant cues. For example, distress vocalizations emitted by mouse pups,
termed pup calls, elicit maternal behavior and time-locked neural activity in left primary auditory cortex (A1) in
both mothers and virgin females with prior pup exposure, but not pup-naïve virgin females. However, naïve
virgins are primed with innate neuronal tuning to a narrow range of pup calls, which broadens with pup care
experience to allow for more reliable caregiving and A1 responses. Prior findings, including those of sponsor Dr.
Bianca Jones Marlin, have shown that this increase in pup call salience is facilitated, at least in part, by the
neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT). However, it is still unknown whether other brain regions exhibit similar experience-
dependent, OXT-mediated plasticity during motherhood. To address this research gap, this proposal aims to
uncover the brain areas responsible for enhanced behavioral responses to pup calls in mice with maternal
experience, both in the presence and absence of typical OXT signaling. This project will take advantage of
cutting-edge techniques that allow for whole-brain imaging and genetic manipulation of neuromodulatory
signaling, including activity mapping via immediate early genes (IEGs), genetic disruption of OXT signaling, and
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of awake mice, in which co-sponsor Dr. Itamar Kahn is an expert.
Aim 1 will use whole-brain activity mapping via IEGs and fMRI in females with varying maternal care experience
to characterize the experience-dependent representation of pup calls throughout the brain. Aim 2 will use daily
maternal behavior assays and longitudinal fMRI to assess pup call responses as virgins learn to provide maternal
care through observation of a mother. In order to model atypical OXT signaling, which has been associated with
PPD, this learning process will be compared between oxytocinergic neuron-ablated versus control virgins.
Together, these efforts will identify brain regions that are important for maternal responses to infant cues,
including in cases of atypical OXT signaling. These brain regions will serve as a launching point for future
research toward using fMRI to identify signatures of potential maladaptive caregiving and developing targeted
treatment when maladaptive caregiving puts the child’s well-being and the mother’s mental health at risk."
10936576,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) offer curative treatment for di-
verse malignant and non-malignant diseases. This field is rapidly developing new strategies for patient assess-
ment, cell selection and manipulation, and pre- and post-procedure treatment. New prophylactic and therapeu-
tic modalities require evaluation in definitive clinical trials, as does the role of HCT versus other therapies.
HCT/ACT trials face unique challenges, including the small number of procedures done at each center, the di-
verse indications for treatment requiring dissimilar approaches, the complexity of the interventions, the multi-
ple, competing risks in the early post-treatment period, and important, though infrequent, late effects. The
Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) was established in 2001 to perform scientifi-
cally meritorious, prospective clinical trials to address these issues. The Network has launched 62 trials with
the support of a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) formed through a consortium of organizations with synergis-
tic expertise: the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW), the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), and The
Emmes Company. This unique Consortium leverages the critically important real-world database of the Center
for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), jointly operated by MCW and NMDP. The
DCC consortium proposes to continue supporting the Network and use its expertise to provide efficient devel-
opment, implementation, and completion of high-quality clinical trials, including concept evaluation and prioriti-
zation; protocol development with appropriate and innovative statistical designs; timely activation and accrual;
monitoring for safety, compliance, and data accuracy; and analyzing and disseminating results. The DCC con-
sortium will coordinate and support all BMT CTN activities by: maintaining a state-of-the-art, secure database
and systems for acquisition and storage of biospecimens, including development of a repository of longitudinal,
clinically annotated specimens from a diverse cross-section of patients receiving cell and gene therapies for
non-malignant blood diseases; ensuring data quality, laboratory compliance, and adherence to regulatory re-
quirements; managing contractual arrangements and fiscal activities; monitoring and improving center and
overall Network performance; supporting logistics for Network Committees and activities; enhancing access to
trials for all patients regardless of ancestry, demographics or socioeconomics; and fostering the next genera-
tion of researchers from diverse backgrounds by providing didactics, mentorship, and meaningful career-en-
hancing experiences. The DCC will continue to leverage Network resources and expertise by collaborating with
the National Cancer Institute-funded National Clinical Trials Network Groups, CIBMTR’s Working Committees,
industry partners, and advocacy groups. These collaborations will maximize completion of scientifically rigor-
ous, clinically relevant, innovative HCT/ACT clinical trials, especially for non-malignant blood disorders and
with novel cell/gene therapies, including those that require collaboration with non-HCT/ACT investigators."

Farmworkers in Yuma, Arizona, and across the nation face numerous social and health risks stemming from the nature of farmwork and the labor laws that govern it. Farmwork is physically punishing and low-wage labor, with extremely long days, environmental exposures, and no overtime or sick pay. Few farmworkers have health insurance. The seasonal nature of farmwork results in record levels of summer unemployment, increasing the economic stress on farmworkers and their families. As a result, farmworkers suffer from high work-related injury and illness rates, stress and depression, and chronic disease. Building on decades of service to the farmworker community, Campesinos Sin Fronteras (CSF) will use a community-based participatory research approach to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention addressing structural factors related to 1) labor practices; 2) housing quality and affordability; and 3) health care access for the farmworker community. In the Achieving Equity in Farmworker Health project, in collaboration with an academic research partner, CSF will leverage its existing relationships with diverse, multi-sector organizations to convene a health equity research assembly (HERA) that will oversee all aspects of the research process. CSF Community health workers (CHWs) will enlist farmworkers in the research process through a series of participatory engagement strategies. Community-wide changes in structural factors and health outcomes will be evaluated using community-led and participant-responsive qualitative and quantitative methods. In analyzing structural determinants of health and developing and implementing the intervention, HERA members will build their research capacity and structural competence in addressing health issues among farmworkers."

This Proposal is a new application for the Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Program (T34) that builds upon a successful history of a previously awarded Bridges to the Baccalaureate Program (R25) to Queensborough Community College (QCC) from 2002 – 2023. The corresponding long-term partnership between QCC, Queens College and City College will be maintained and strengthened to advance QCC’s ability to train and graduate students while maximizing student access to biomedical research opportunities. The proposed program will enhance and broaden participation of students in science and research and facilitate their transfer to baccalaureate programs in biomedicine or biomedically relevant STEM fields. Herein, we define efforts and activities to sustain the scientific interests of trainees from all backgrounds, with targeted recruitment activities to diversify the applicant pool by including research-oriented students, particularly from underrepresented groups in QCC. We expect our proposed efforts to have a broader impact as it extends to both Bridges and non-Bridges students. The Bridges students will conduct research under the supervision of experienced biology, chemistry, physics, math and biomedically relevant STEM faculty mentors, who will attend a mandatory mentor training workshop to work effectively with trainees from various cultural and neurodiverse groups. The present T34 application includes a dynamic team of experienced faculty mentors from the previous R25 grant and new faculty mentors with a strong background in research who are passionate about undergraduate research (UR) in biomedical sciences and updating the curricula and pedagogy to enhance student success. The research mentors will serve as role models and provide students with academic support, encouragement, career advisement, and visibility within the academic community. Our program will emphasize laboratory research training, professional and career development skills, and scientific communication skills (including an oral presentation and a written report at the program-wide seminar). A comprehensive system of academic and psychosocial support will be provided to all participants. Our proposed transfer counseling and early interaction with the senior colleges are planned to ease transition to baccalaureate programs. Institutional UR outcomes will be improved through enhanced academic planning, curricula upgrades, updated technology in teaching labs, faculty development, and peer mentoring. A pre- Bridges workshop will be conducted every summer and winter semester to let students become aware of the Bridges opportunities. Enrichment workshops will continue to be provided to both Bridges and non-Bridges students, in General Biology I and Pre-Calculus to help them get beyond the gateway to careers in biomedicine. The Gateway to Research workshops will help promote awareness of biomedical research and eliminate student misconceptions about research. In addition, students will continue to learn of the excitement and significance of biomedical research through the Bridges research seminars and workshops during summer, specifically providing hands-on skills about conceptual understanding and interacting with Bridges alumni. The project’s goals are closely aligned with those of the NIH and will aim to support the development of an inclusive and diverse workforce at a critical transition point in the training pathway and prepares such trainees for a career in the biomedical research workforce."

As the most common dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) exacts an immense personal, societal, and economic toll. Though
we largely conceptualize AD as a disease of aging, heritable and non-heritable factors impact brain function and
physiology, either continuously or at specific time points during the lifespan, and thereby alter risk for devolvement of AD.
Indeed, many comorbidities and additional pathologies contribute to both dementia risk and clinical progression. In
recognition of this complexity, we now study AD and AD-related disorders (ADRDs) in a more holistic fashion with the
long-term goal of translating our enhanced understanding into more effective diagnostic paradigms and interventions.
Multi-omic studies and other “big data” studies of dementia reinforce the complexity of ADRDs and the challenges that
we continue to face in terms of making real impacts on the lives of those who suffer from dementia or who may get it in
the future, as well as their caregivers. Given the large number of “big data” initiatives in the ADRD research space and
their potential transformative power, we propose a new pre- and post-doctoral training program designed to bridge gaps
between “big data” science and more focused hypothesis-driven biological studies and embed in all our trainees a deep
understanding of ADRDs. The overarching goal of this program is to provide pre- and post-doctoral trainees with the
comprehensive knowledge base and tools necessary to tackle the clinical and translational complexities presented by
ADRDs and associated “big data” over the course of two years. More specifically, we propose highly individualized training
that can bidirectionally i) provide big data focused trainees with more biological insight into ADRDs and ii) equip trainees
with a more experimental biological focus with the ability to access, analyze, and utilize big data sets. The program entitled
Alzheimer’s Disease Big Data to Biology training program (ADBDB-TP) will i) recruit and rigorously train a diverse group of
4 pre- and post-doctoral candidates each, who seek to develop basic, translational, or clinical careers focused on studying
ADRDs, ii) develop and implement individualized, tailored, training programs which challenge scientists to expand their
expertise by embracing the concept of ‘Big Data to Biology’ in ADRDs, iii) engage diverse faculty to train the next
generation of dementia researchers by cultivating and maintaining a rigorous but supportive infrastructure for graduate
and postgraduate training in ADRDs, and iv) evaluate the progress of the ADBDB-TP trainees and address barriers towards
the goal of independence in AD-related research. This program will be structured to ensure trainees a) have foundational
knowledge with respect to ADRDs and the various types of research conducted in the ADRD field, b) obtain individualized
training and master skills that both ensure short-term research success and prepare them for future career advancement,
and c) can more facilely identify gaps in our knowledge of ADRDs and develop research strategies that will address those
knowledge gaps. Aspirationally, the trainee outcomes we envision is training scientists who are equally comfortable and
skilled in generating, accessing, and analyzing big data as they are in designing & executing experimental biological studies."

The FUture Surgeons and Scientists Investigating ONcology (FUSSION) YES program at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is designed to increase interest in cancer-related research among college
students from groups who are underrepresented in biomedical sciences, with the goal of creating a pipeline of
diverse future physician-scientists with cancer-related research programs. To achieve this goal, FUSSION will
provide a 2-year mentored research experience augmented by monthly workshops on cancer-related topics,
scientific communication, and career and academic development. The NCI Youth Enjoy Science program
provides an ideal avenue to achieve the following specific aims: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Provide cancer-related
research experiences for undergraduate students with mentoring from successful physician-scientists.
To achieve this aim, students will participate in a 2-year experience on cancer-related issues, mentored by
scientists and physician-scientists, including two consecutive summers of full-time, research with dedicated
scientists. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Establish a curriculum that provides a foundational understanding of a
variety of cancers, research-related knowledge, responsible conduct of research, professional and
career development skills, academic development, and dissemination of research results. Students will
receive instruction on foundational and clinical cancer topics, along with training in scientific communication,
career development, and academic preparation to enter graduate and medical school. SPECIFIC AIM 3:
Expand awareness of current cancer research and the importance of the FUSSION program by
integrating outreach opportunities into students’ research dissemination strategies. Students will
disseminate their research to the UAB campus and wider communities: at a departmental research event, a
campus symposium that family and friends can attend, and to the community through an outreach panel
discussion. Participants will share the knowledge and experiences gained and the impact it has had on their
understanding of cancer, with an emphasis on the importance of research in addressing cancer prevention,
treatment, and disparities. The FUSSION project is unique in its focus on physician-scientists. To our
knowledge, no other YES program has a specific focus on physicians as a part of cancer research. Given
UAB’s exceptional success in research and training, and the Department of Surgery’s experience developing
similar research and training programs, UAB is well positioned to implement such a program. Moreover,
because one-quarter of the Alabama population is African-American, UAB offers a unique population to
investigate cancer-related disparities and minority health. There is a great need for more physicians who are
also researchers, in order to translate scientific discoveries to the bedside. Increasing the number and diversity
of physician-scientists can directly impact patient diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes to mitigate health
disparities."
10917302,"The Neurovascular unit (NVU) comprises of cells in the brain vasculature (endothelial cells and pericytes) working in 
coordination with parenchymal cells (neurons and astrocytes) to maintain brain homeostasis and cognitive function. 
Intricate functional interactions among NVU cells, referred to as neurovascular coupling, is progressively impaired 
and NVU composition is severely disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease. However, the underlying pathophysiological 
mechanisms are poorly understood due to paucity of molecular level information on the less abundant, yet 
functionally critical, cerebrovascular endothelial cells and pericytes. The fMRI imaging, widely used in the clinic to 
evaluate neurovascular coupling, may not inform molecular level changes. It is challenging to identify changes in 
NVU composition using standard histopathological methods, because they lack sensitivity and specificity to locate 
endothelial cells and pericytes in the brain tissue. Bulk RNA sequencing from postmortem Alzheimer's brain tissue 
can be used to investigate NVU components, but it measures gene expression averaged across all cells, thus making it 
difficult to define cell-specific pathways and NVU constituent interactions. Single-cell methods and linear 
deconvolution techniques are currently employed to analyze bulk RNA sequencing data to determine cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. However, these techniques struggle to capture the molecular signature of low-abundant cells like endothelial and pericytes. The objective of the current study is to develop deep-learning methods 
to accurately predict the composition and transcriptomic signature of NVU cells, and to map interactions among them. 
Our central hypothesis is that data-driven deep-learning models, which have the flexibility to capture underlying 
gene-gene and cell-cell interactions in the brain tissue, will predict the composition and transcriptomic signature of 
NVU cells more effectively than the conventional methods. In Aim 1, we will design NUGENT, a novel deep-learning framework, to identify cell-type composition and predict cell-type-specific gene expression patterns. In Aim 
2, we will validate NUGENT using new scRNA-seq data of NVU constituent cells harvested from Alzheimer’s 
disease transgenic mice (APPswe/PSEN1dE9) and their non-transgenic littermates. Employing the data generated in 
Aim 2 and publicly available patient and mouse data on the NUGENT framework, in Aim 3 we will investigate 
molecular pathways regulating neurovascular coupling in cognitively normal and Alzheimer’s patients. It is highly 
likely that the proposed studies will help identify molecular determinants of neurovascular dysfunction underlying 
age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s dementia and facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets."

This is an administrative supplement to a currently awarded study, Impact of a Novel Socially Assistive Robotic
Architecture on Engaging Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Related
Dementia in Long Term Care Settings (R01AG062685). Apathy is common in persons with AD and ADRD with
prevalence rates up to 72%. It is associated with further cognitive decline, functional deficits, reduced quality of
life, social isolation, and increased mortality. Apathy imposes significant burden on LTC staff and negatively
impact quality of care, staff satisfaction and turnover. Since few pharmacologic options exist, a major strategy is
to foster older adults’ engagement in social, physical and cognitive activities, primarily those that are multimodal
in nature. However, these interventions often require significant personnel time and resources, a major concern
given the current nursing shortage and high turnover among LTC nursing personnel. The Centers of Medicare
and Medicaid Services mandates LTC facilities to provide meaningful engaging activities for residents, which
can be resource intensive and are difficult for many US LTC settings. The currently awarded study focuses on
the use of an intelligent socially assistive robot (SAR) based architecture, called ARIA (Adaptive Robot-mediated
Intervention Architecture), as an approach to engage older adult residents suffering from apathy. This
interdisciplinary proposal is directly aligned with the NIA goals of understanding and developing effective
interventions using smart technology to reduce the burden of age-related diseases and address the special
caregiver needs of those caring for persons with dementia (PWD). This multi-phase, multi-site, mixed methods
clinical trial will systematically examine responsiveness and engagement among persons with MCI or dementia
to two types of SARs (humanoid and animal), its effect on cognitive, physical and social function as well as the
impact of SARs on informal and formal caregivers with a goal towards future scalability and sustainability. The
specific aims of the proposed research are to compare the effect of usual care (UC) group to UC+ARIA group
on reducing apathy among older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild dementia, or moderate
dementia and to identify barriers and facilitators to SAR implementation across sites to address future scalability
and sustainability. This study will contribute to the development of improved intelligent technology as an effective
approach to engage older PWD with the long term goal of enhancing function and quality of life. This
administrative supplement application is in response to the unforeseen and unavoidable consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic on long term care settings that has resulted in significant delays in study deployment,
increased time and effort for long term care site recruitment, and increased time and effort in conducting the
study from originally conceived. The supplement would allow us to intensify our recruiting efforts thereby meeting
the enrollment goals of the parent grant."
10936921,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) being the most common chronic liver disease worldwide,
molecular mechanisms contributing to its etiology and progression are still unclear. This gap in knowledge has
prevented the understanding of basic biology, pathogenesis, and the development of novel therapeutics for
NAFLD. There is currently no FDA-approved therapy for NAFLD. A vast majority of prior studies that investigated
NAFLD were performed primarily on obese models since obesity and NAFLD are strongly intertwined. Despite
these studies, the role of insulin resistance in NAFLD is unclear. Interestingly, our preliminary data demonstrated
that L-PGDS knockout mice exhibited a NAFLD phenotype along with significant insulin resistance and weight
gain on high-fat diet. Lipocalin Prostaglandin D2 Synthase (L-PGDS) functions as a prostaglandin synthase
where it catalyzes the isomerization of PGH2 to PGD2. PGD2 regulates its physiological function through two
individual G-protein coupled receptors named DP1 and DP2. Therefore, we hypothesized that the lack of PGD2
will induce fatty liver disease possibly involving hepatic insulin resistance and obesity. The objective of this
SuRE First application is to investigate the role of L-PGDS and its metabolite PGD2 in NAFLD. Aim 1 of the
current proposal is dedicated on elucidating the effect of insulin signaling on L-PGDS mRNA and protein
expression, localization, and function. Next, we will be investigating the role of L-PGDS on glucose and lipid
metabolism through studying energy substrate utilization, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation. Additionally,
metabolomics and transcriptomics unbiased approaches will discover L-PGDS-regulated signaling pathways in
NAFLD. Aim 3 is dedicated to determining the role of PGD2 receptor modulators, DP1 and D2 receptor agonist
and antagonist, in NAFLD using insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and db/db mice subjected to high fat diet. The
significance of the proposed research is that, once hepatic regulation of L-PGDS signaling is understood,
targets for NAFLD pharmacotherapy could be developed. This work is innovative as it elucidates the novel role
of L-PGDS in fatty liver disease and defines its link to insulin resistance and obesity that is supported by our
preliminary data. Collectively, our research will shed new light on the role of L-PGDS in liver physiology and
diabetes- and obesity-induced NAFLD and discover new therapeutic targets for future studies."
10935078,"Surgery has a key role in the management of many types of brain cancers. In fact, the completion of surgical
resection is a key prognostic factor in brain cancer treatment. This requires surgeons to identify residual
tumors as well as to margin the proximity of the tumor to adjacent normal tissue. Subjective assessments, such
as palpation or visual observations, are commonly used by oncology surgeons during resection to differentiate
cancer lesions from normal tissue, which could potentially result in either an incomplete tumor resection, or
accidental removal of normal tissue. Moreover, malignant brain tumors are even more difficult to distinguish
from normal brain tissue, and resecting noncancerous tissue may create neurological defects after surgery.
Therefore, utilizing an intraoperative, real-time guidance technique in the operating room is essential to quickly
optimize the resection margin in brain tumors ultimately improving surgical outcomes. In this proposed study,
first, we aspire to develop and characterize tumor-targeting polymeric micelles that carry a self-quenched near-
infrared (NIR) imaging agent (Aim 1). These will be a micelles-based on/off fluorescence switch system where
the whole-body fluorescence remains low (“off”) until those are released from the micelles as monomers,
emitting strong fluorescence (“on”) on the tumor tissues. Secondly, we will evaluate the practicality of this
system when administered intranasally for providing optical image guidance during brain cancer surgery. In
vivo whole-body optical imaging on glioma-bearing xenograft mice will be obtained upon intranasal delivery of
the tumor-targeting polymeric micelles carrying an NIR imaging agent in self-quenched state (Aim 2A). We will
then test this system in the “simulated” operating room where intranasally delivered system provides
intraoperative image guidance to support complete tumor excision and superior surgical outcome on glioma-
bearing xenograft mice (Aim 2B). We believe that intranasally administered polymeric micelles developed for
this proposed work will help overcome some fundamental challenges that fluorescence imaging faces by
avoiding the BBB and delivering a contrast agent effectively and selectively to brain tumors.
We expect that the results we obtain from this proposed work will open the possibility of employing intranasally
administered optical imaging agent for visualizing brain tumors that minimizes incomplete tumor resection or
accidental removal of surrounding normal tissues during surgery. Tumor removal surgery supported by
intraoperative image guidance will highly likely demonstrate high surgical accuracy and precision and can
significantly improve surgical outcomes and patient survival, potentially adding decades of quality life."
10934658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Monogenic autoimmune diseases, while rare, offer a unique opportunity to develop models that enable a more
mechanistic understanding of the disease process, in particular, if the mutation is in the coding region and the
penetrance is high. We have identified a family, in which father and two daughters have Immunoglobulin G4-
related disease (IgG4-RD) while the mother is healthy. Exome sequencing identified shared mutations in the E3
ubiquitin ligase UBR4 (Cys4179Ter) and the transcription factor IKZF1 (IKAROS, Arg183His) genes in affected
family members. IgG4-RD is a systemic autoimmune disease manifesting as a fibrosing inflammation of major
salivary glands, orbits, pancreas, and retroperitoneal soft tissue, frequently associated with elevated serum IgG4
and IgE, increased peripheral eosinophilia and high rates of atopy/allergies. The pathogenesis of the disease is
essentially unknown. IKZF1 is a gene that has been associated with a variety of autoimmune manifestations,
without that pathogenetic pathways have been identified. Specifically, loss of function mutations cause immune
deficiencies combined with tissue inflammation, while IKZF1 haplotypes have been associated with SLE and
other autoimmune diseases in GWAS studies. The IKZF1 mutation identified here is unique in that it is a gain-
of-function (GOF) due to increasing DNA binding affinity. We propose that an understanding of the effect of the
GOF effects and their interaction with the proteome changes due UBR4 haploinsufficiency provides an
opportunity to define mechanisms that lead to defective tolerance and excessive TH2 polarization. We propose
a two-pronged approach. In Aims 1 and 2, we will build on our preliminary data that UBR4 haploinsufficiency
increases CD45 expression while GOF IKAROS increases FYN transcription. Aim 1 will determine whether
UBR4 and IKFZ1 GOF gene variants increase TCR signaling and break tolerance by upregulating CD45 and
FYN. Aim 2 will examine the model that FYN drives TH2 polarization by phosphorylating ITCH2 and preventing
the degradation of JunB. In these aims, we use a combination of human in vitro and mouse in vivo studies.
Therapeutic implications will be examined in models of allergic airway inflammation by pharmacological depletion
of IKAROS, as recently done for human SLE. In addition to these hypothesis-driven studies based on a large
body of preliminary data, we propose to continue an unbiased screening of the proteomic and transcriptomic
changes due to the gene variants to identify molecules that can be built into the current model. Aim 3 will
determine whether the biomarkers developed from studying this digenic disease have broader implications for
non-familial IgG4-RD disease as well as for other diseases that are characterized by an unopposed TH2
immunity."
10939752,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are childhood exposures to potentially traumatic family and community
experiences that can have lasting, negative impact on health, are a driver of health disparities, and have
potential intergenerational transmission of effects. Preliminary data from the parent study for this proposed
study indicate that ACEs are highly prevalent in low-income, urban parents, with 54.7% of 139 parent
participants reporting 4 or more ACEs. Positive childhood experiences (PCEs) are relational experiences that
confer a sense of safety and nurturance during childhood, such as feeling safe with at least one adult in the
home. PCEs are associated with improved physical and mental health. PCEs have the potential to promote
positive outcomes even when ACEs are high. Current neighborhood violence is expected to compound the
impact of ACEs on parenting practices due to ongoing or recurrent activation of neurobehavioral responses to
threat. The purpose of this convergent mixed methods study is to understand how parents' exposures to ACEs
and PCEs impact their parenting practices, particularly in the context of living in unsafe neighborhoods by
addressing the following specific aims: 1: Test the associations among parents' ACEs, PCEs, and more
positive parenting practices in a sample of parents (n=200) raising young children (2-8 years old) in Baltimore.
2: Examine contextual effects of current neighborhood safety (violent crime rate and parent perception) by
testing the interactions between threat-type ACEs and neighborhood safety variables, controlling for other
neighborhood-level SES characteristics. 3: Understand how parents' own childhood experiences (ACEs and
PCEs) influence their parenting practices in the context of low versus moderate to high neighborhood safety.
The proposed study will be nested within an ongoing parent study in Baltimore City Public Schools. The
proposed study will use baseline data only for a cross-sectional quantitative arm, followed by a qualitative arm
that integrates with the quantitative data. Multivariate regression, multilevel modeling, and conditional process
modeling will be used to test associations among ACEs, PCEs, and parenting, and then to test these
associations and the association with neighborhood safety. In the qualitative phase, indvidual interviews will
use an interpretive phenomenological approach to gain a better understanding of the processes and contextual
factors that contribute to participants' parenting in the context of neighborhood safety. This design integrates
the analysis of associations between ACEs, PCEs, parenting practices, and neighborhood safety with analysis
of parents' perspectives on the impact of their childhood experiences on parenting, role of neighborhood
safety, and other contextual variables. This research will identify protective factors in the intergenerational
transmission of ACEs and uses geospatial data to explore how neighborhoods influence the impact of ACEs
and PCEs. It will inform future research on family- and neighborhood-level interventions to promote safe,
stable, nurturing relationships in families and neighborhoods to reduce the rate and impact of ACEs."
10939760,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is mounting evidence of peripheral inflammation coincident with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet the drivers
and specific features of these immune aberrancies are unknown. Also, the connections between this peripheral
inflammation and the onset and progression of dementias are not elucidated. Our previous work found that TIGIT
expression on γδ T cells, a unique ‘innate-like’ T cell population, correlates with plasma markers of general
inflammation in both ART-suppressed HIV infection and with normal aging and may indicate a hyper-
inflammatory state of this T cell subset. γδ T cells have recently been implicated as drivers of AD pathogenesis.
The Aims of my ongoing R01 award seek to define γδ T cell subset heterogeneity in our HIV and Aging cohort
participants and to address our hypothesis that with aging and HIV infection, GI resident γδ T cells become
aberrantly activated and cause gut leakiness, resulting in an influx of immune cells and bacterial products to the
bloodstream which consequents in systemic inflammation and age-associated co-morbidities. GI abnormalities,
including microbiota dysbiosis and intestinal barrier permeability, are now strongly linked to neuroinflammation,
breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB), cognitive deficits, and AD. Therefore, as an addendum to the work
proposed in my R01, we propose to expand our sample analysis to include peripheral blood and brain tissue
samples from the Health Outreach Program for the Elderly (HOPE) study samples, a cohort of the NIH-funded
Boston University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ARDC), to build evidence in support of our hypothesis
that with aging in some individuals, alterations in the GI tract induce resident γδ T cells into a hyperinflammatory
state, driving gut leakiness, which results in γδ T cell influx into the circulation, systemic inflammation, and
ultimately infiltration of γδ T cells and other immune components into the brain, initiating the pathogenic events
that lead to AD. We propose two Aims that will examine immune cell signatures in PBMC via 32-color spectral
flow cytometry, measurement of 30 markers of inflammation, neuroinflammation, and gut leakiness in plasma,
and 40-marker analysis of cell signatures in brain tissue from neurotypical, mild cognitively impaired, and AD
individuals. Both cross-sectional (Aim 1) and longitudinal (Aim 2) studies will be performed, with the latter
enabling cause-and-effect/mechanistic insights to be gleaned via intra-individual analysis of temporally linked
trajectories readout trajectories. Using bioinformatic platforms for data analysis, our proposed Aims will elucidate
specific links between immune signatures and temporal trajectories with the onset and progression of
neurological disease and determine connections between γδ T cells, gut leakiness, and AD. Also, our findings
will provide the Preliminary Data for an AD-related R01 application and also may elucidate novel biomarkers for
early detection and/or therapeutic strategies to abrogate and/or prevent AD and related dementias."
10939762,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF THE FUNDED PARENT GRANT AWARD
Patients in intensive care units are at high risk for long-term health threats including cognitive impairment. The
correlation was only recently revealed after large-scale follow-up cognitive assessments on intensive patient
survivors after their discharge from the hospital. There are testimonials, reviews and calls-to-action on many
critical care websites and in journal issues over the last 2-3 years on this public health crisis. However, the
causative mechanisms that lead to abrupt cognitive impairment are unclear—they are not attributable to age,
gender, relative brain hypoxia, anesthetics and sedatives.
Nosocomial bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa impair endothelial cell function during the course of
infection that culminates in acute lung injury. Recent studies implicate that after P. aeruginosa infection,
endothelial cells produce and releases cytotoxic amyloids that are transmissible among cells. Having access to
the endothelium of whole blood circulation, these cytotoxic amyloids likely propagate. In fact, the amyloids are
detectable in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of nosocomial pneumonia patients in intensive care units. Further,
when applied to brain slices, the cytotoxic amyloids derived from endothelium impair neural activity and synaptic
information transfer.
This project takes advantage of vertically integrated approaches, ranging from the use of different bacteria stains
and cultured cells, to in vitro brain slice recordings and in vivo animal behavior studies. The studies are designs
to test the hypothesis that nosocomial pneumonias induce amyloid protein accumulation in CSF, resulting in LTP
suppression and learning deficit. Altogether, studies systematically examine a possible lung-brain axis, where a
primary lung infection induces production of cytotoxic amyloids that spread to the cerebrospinal fluid and
contribute to cognitive impairment. This work addresses a novel mechanism underlying the end organ
dysfunction that is evident during, and in the aftermath of, critical illness. Mechanistic insight into endothelium-
derived cytotoxicity to brain function will reveal novel therapeutic approaches to prevent cognitive decline.

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States (US). Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer.
In the past two decades, melanoma incidence among Hispanics has risen by 20%. The mortality rate of Hispanics
is higher compared to Non-Hispanic whites (NHW). In general, compared to NHW, Hispanics diagnosed with
melanoma are younger, have thicker tumors, and have worse survival rates. Skin cancer can be prevented with
regular sun protection, and early detection can improve skin cancer outcomes.
 The Hispanic population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the US. Alarmingly, Hispanics are less aware
of the symptoms and harms of skin cancers, tend to have misperceptions regarding the risks and benefits of skin
cancer prevention behaviors, engage in less sun protection behaviors than NHW, and only 18% of them reported
ever having done a skin self-examination. In addition, due to the increase of acculturation of Hispanics in the US,
their sun-safety behaviors are poorer than non-US Hispanics. Occupational exposure to ultraviolet radiation
(UVR) is a risk factor for skin cancer, and Hispanic individuals are over-represented in a number of outdoor
occupations. Approximately 21% of the 2018 US Hispanic workforce were employed in industries that involved
significant amounts of occupational UVR exposure such as construction. Therefore, an increasing effort to raise
awareness regarding sun protection and skin self-examination behaviors is needed to address the existing gap
of skin cancer research among Hispanics.
 This research project seeks to develop a mobile-based and user-centered intervention to promote sun
protection and skin self-examination among a diverse sample of Hispanics using an iterative approach to capture
relevant contextual issues and evaluate the preliminary effects of the intervention. During the K99 phase, I will:
1) collect, analyze, and triangulate data from the Hispanic community and other stakeholders (e.g., health care
providers and community leaders) for skin cancer digital intervention development; and 2) through a user-
centered approach, develop an innovative WhatsApp intervention to promote skin cancer-related health
behaviors among Hispanics to improve participants’ engagement in the intervention. During the R00 phase, I
will: 3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of this mobile intervention in a pre-, post-test study among
Hispanics at risk for skin cancer; and 4) refine the intervention and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
using this mobile service among Hispanics at risk for skin cancers and assess the preliminary effects of the
mobile intervention at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. The intervention has strong potential for cost-
effective, widespread dissemination and targets an understudied group at-risk for future cancer development.
The training experiences and mentoring obtained during this K99/R00 project are critical foundations for a
successful independent cancer research career."

This application seeks five years of continued support for an NEI Core Grant that has facilitated the research
efforts of vision scientists at the University of California Davis for the past 25 years. The goal is to enhance vision
science by providing cost-efficient, stable, and shared resources that are not generally available to individual
laboratories. It will enhance collaborations and translational research among a large group of vision scientists at
UC Davis holding 17 Core-eligible NEI R01 grants. It will also facilitate collection of preliminary data for new
grant applications by funded and yet-to-be-funded UC Davis laboratories, and sharing of resources developed
for UC Davis with the vision science community outside of our institution. Building on the existing strengths of
the individual cores while also being responsive to new directions and opportunities in the field, the currently
funded cores have evolved to better serve the needs of our NEI investigators. The proposed cores are: (i)
Software Engineering, (ii) Molecular Construct and Packaging, (iii) Microscopy and Tissue Processing, (iv) Small
Animal Ocular Imaging, and (v) Large Animal. Each core director has one or more NEI R01 grants, and is
supported by talented and skilled technical staff. These five cores provide custom facilities and personnel that
serve the needs of our NEI investigators and their trainees. The administrative structure includes an Executive
Committee comprised of the principal investigator and the core directors, along with regular input from all vision
scientists on campus, and a distinguished group of external advisors. Priorities for use of core facilities have
been carefully honed and made available to all investigators. The administration of UC Davis has been, and
continues to be, exceptionally supportive of vision research on our campus. This is demonstrated by a substantial
increase in the number of vision scientists recruited to our campus, by internal funding of $350,000 as a
supplement to this grant, the planned recruitment of new faculty in vision science, and funding for the Center for
Visual Sciences, which provides a means for unifying our community of vision researchers and fostering
collaborations with an accomplished cohort of biologists on campus and vision scientists at other institutions."
10939722,"The purpose of the Bioinformatics and statistics core is to provide bioinformatic and statistical support
for clinical, genomic and laboratory studies. A wide variety of studies are supported by the core and
the core resources have been extensively used by our research community. In response to this high
demand in this competing renewal we have added additional personnel to the core and have focused
activities on those that are most requested by MEE investigators. The core resources are targeted to
MEE investigators with qualifying R01s but are also used by other investigators and have been
especially valuable for young investigators who are starting new research projects who would
otherwise not have access to these resources. The Bioinformatics and statistics core resources and
expert personnel provide opportunities for collaboration and stimulate new research ideas and
investigations. By helping investigators plan effective investigations and efficiently and appropriately
analyze experimental data, the Bioinformatics and statistics core has enhanced the quality of vision
research at MEE and has promoted increased productivity of the vision science program. Similar to
the other cores for this P30 Core grant, the resources provided by this core broadly impact the
translation of basic science discoveries to improve our understanding of the pathogenic features of
clinical disease and to develop new therapies and diagnostic modalities. In particular, the availability
of the core resources draws clinical investigators into research studies, thus enhancing the translation
of research discoveries."
10940583,"The proposed CDA-2 will include a randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy of using
Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-intoxicating phytocannabinoid, as an adjunctive to exposure therapy. The
trial will compare PE+CBD to PE+placebo in a sample of 136 Veterans with PTSD at the VASDHS.
The rationale for the proposed RCT is informed by neurobiological, preclinical, and clinical research
on PTSD and cannabinoids. The study represents the logical and innovative next step for augmenting
existing treatments and developing novel pharmacotherapy for PTSD. Moreover, the proposal: 1)
aligns with the VA's patient care mission in its aim to improve treatment for Veterans with PTSD, 2)
directly addresses the VA's PTSD Psychopharmacology Initiative, and 3) addresses an area of research
that has largely been ignored by VA but is of direct relevance to multiple VA stakeholders (i.e.,
investigating the efficacy of cannabinoid treatments). Findings from the proposed RCT will inform
clinical practice and policy by investigating whether administration of CBD in the context of PE
therapy will improve treatment outcomes for Veterans with PTSD.
The proposed CDA-2 will provide the candidate with an important training opportunity to merge her
primary research interests (cannabinoid therapeutics and PTSD RCTs) and to develop specialized skill
in RCT execution that involves both behavioral and novel psychopharmacology. The candidate will be
mentored by leading experts who specialize in: PTSD treatment, psychopharmacology, RCT design,
cannabinoid administration trials, and biostatistics. The proposed work will be conducted within a
leading VA research center (VASDHS) and world-renowned research institution (UCSD School of
Medicine).
The proposed trial will also allow the candidate necessary training for achievement of her long-term
goal to become an independent researcher within VA. Scaffolded training and mentorship in RCT
design, cannabinoid psychopharmacology, biostatistics and grant writing will help propel the
candidate to independence in a cutting-edge research area. Finally, results of the trial will lay the
groundwork for future implementation studies that would attempt to determine feasibility of use of
CBD across VA clinics and determine whether implementation leads to reduced sessions of PE,
greater patient and therapist satisfaction, and lower costs to VA."
10937145,"Project Summary
 With cells constantly encountering DNA damaging agents, mechanisms for prompt DNA repair are
crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Aberrations and mutations in the proteins involved these processes are
closely associated with a plethora of diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders. Among various
types of DNA damage, single-strand breaks (SSBs) are the most prevalent, occurring at a rate of 55,000 per
cell daily. Understanding the repair of SSBs within chromatin through the base excision repair (BER) mechanism
is the primary focus of the proposed research project. The proposed research project primarily aims to unravel
the complexities of SSB repair within chromatin through the BER mechanism. This multifaceted pathway
involves poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and histone acetylation, both closely associated with DNA repair.
PARP1, the most abundant member of the PARP family, is the enzyme that confers poly-ADP-ribosyl groups to
histones upon detection of SSBs. This PARylation then recruits and activates various repair proteins like DNA
Ligase III (LIG3) and Polynucleotide Kinase 3'-Phosphatase (PNKP). PNKP has dual functions in the process,
particularly for SSBs induced by radioactivity, by adding a phosphate group to the 5'-end of DNA breaks and
removing one from the 3'-end. This prepares the DNA ends for the action of DNA ligases, such as LIG3, thereby
playing a vital role in DNA repair mechanisms. This proposal aims to understand how three DNA repair
proteins—PARP1, LIG3, and PNKP—recognize and repair SSBs within the context of nucleosomes and to
explore the interplay between PARylation and acetylation of histones in these processes. We will investigate
how PARP1 identifies and recognizes SSBs within nucleosomal contexts, a critical phase in the DNA damage
repair process. Additionally, we will explore the roles of enzymes LIG3 and PNKP in repairing SSBs within
nucleosomal structures. To achieve these goals, we will map the accessibility of SSB sites within nucleosomes
using DNA libraries and next-generation sequencing, aiming to optimize the positioning of an SSB for facilitating
the formation of nucleosome complexes with the DNA repair proteins. Subsequently, we will employ biophysical
tools and functional assays to characterize these interactions and functions, both in the presence and absence
of histone modifications. Finally, we will leverage state-of-the-art NMR techniques and cryo-EM to obtain detailed
structural and dynamic information about the nucleosome when complexed with PARP1 (or its zinc finger
domains), LIG3, and PNKP. The long-term goal of this research is to provide an enhanced fundamental
understanding of BER mechanisms within nucleosomal contexts, laying a molecular foundation for the design
of drugs and therapeutics that can beneficially modulate these mechanisms in various disease states."
10937922,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chromosomes must be highly packaged to fit with cells. Modern tools like 3D chromosome capture allow for
visualization of chromosome organization but are limited in describing gene-level packaging and cannot reveal
the mechanisms that underlie packaging. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to understand genome
function and to identify chromosome vulnerabilities as targets for future therapeutics. We propose to attack two
major challenges limiting our understanding of chromosome organization in bacteria: understanding
supercoiling and structuring protein function. First, supercoiling represents the DNA winding about itself, with
“positive” supercoiling (+SC) describing an overwound structure, which is refractory to DNA duplex melting.
+SC is generated as a byproduct of replication and must be removed by topoisomerase enzymes or replication
will cease, leading to cell death. Prior to my work, a lack of tools to map +SC and a lack of knowledge of
topoisomerase regulators meant that our cellular understanding of +SC was limited. Second, bacterial
chromosomes are structured by nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs are a group of sequence-diverse,
functionally heterogeneous, and poorly understood proteins. Our discoveries in Caulobacter crescentus of an
essential NAP and +SC regulator called GapR has empowered us to begin untangling chromosome
packaging. We initially showed that GapR binds +SC in a sequence-independent manner to stimulate
topoisomerase activity and promote replication. We then developed GapR into technology that allows us to
“see” where +SC occurs. While GapR homologs are ubiquitous in ⍺-proteobacteria, analogous NAPs that
regulate topoisomerase activity in other bacteria have not been identified. Our preliminary data suggests that
bacterial viruses (phages) encode GapR homologs that hijack bacterial GapR to promote infection, uncovering
a beneficial role for phage hijacking of bacterial NAPs during infection. We have also developed technology to
capture topoisomerase regulators in bacteria. In this proposal, we will 1) elucidate GapR mechanism as a
model for understanding how bacteria and phage control +SC to proliferate, 2) mine bacteria and phage
genomes to characterize additional topoisomerase regulators, and 3) examine NAP hijacking during phage
infection. These projects will describe fundamental paradigms of bacterial chromosome organization and
improve our understanding of phage-bacterial warfare. Further, topoisomerases are important antibacterial
targets while phages are potential antibiotic alternatives, thus the findings of this proposal will identify
vulnerabilities in bacterial chromosome regulation as future antibiotic targets and improve our understanding of
phage infection for phage therapy."
10925141,"Neuromas are painful tumors of nerve tissue that result from amputation or other nerve injury. Peripheral nerve
injury is the most-impactful comorbidity associated with the most common types of battlefield trauma, and
many of these cases eventually result in formation of a painful neuroma. This condition often requires
additional invasive surgery for our Veterans, including resectioning of the injured nerve to remove the
neuroma, which may form again. Diabetes, a chronic health problem that is a priority for VAMCs across the
country, is another common cause of amputation. Neuroma pain (or “nerve pain” as it is commonly called in
the amputee community) is also one of the major reasons patients reduce/stop use of assistive devices,
including prosthetics. Further, presence of neuroma can be a disqualifying factor for some prosthetics and
nerve interfaces. Although treatments are available, there is currently no clinical Standard of Care for
prevention or treatment of neuroma because the available approaches are not sufficiently effective. Although
essentially all unrepaired nerve injuries result in a neuroma, not all neuromas are painful. Unfortunately, there
is no “safe window” for neuromas – pain can begin at any point after the nerve injury which induced the
neuroma. Neuromas continue to grow and their structure evolves over time, likely introducing interactions that
would not occur in normal tissue and developing emergent properties. These etiological factors suggest that,
although sensory neurons are necessary for neuroma pain, it is the neuroma structure itself that may establish
the physical relationships which lead to pain. Therefore, understanding what factors control formation of
neuroma structure is necessary to develop approaches to prevent neuroma formation.
 Our plan, to be pursued in subsequent MERIT applications, will tests the hypothesis that it is regeneration of
injured axons which controls neuroma formation, and that subsequent aberrant coupling of sympathetic or
motor axons and/or immune cells with sensory axons is the major factor driving neuroma pain. To this end, this
SPiRE proposal is designed to validate genetic models and experimental designs to enable us, and the field, to
address fundamental questions which remain unanswered. This project will test the utility of a set of cell type-
specific knockout and reporter mice for neuroma research. The premise for the proposed mouse lines is that
neuroma formation is apparently completely prevented by global knockout of a gene required for axonal
regeneration. The premise for the new experimental design is that no existing animal models reflect the clinical
reality of the repeated nerve injury that occurs with neuroma resection and recurrence, despite the fact that the
condition of repeated injury induces changes that differ from that of single injuries. This SPiRE project will
provide the animal lines, visualization methods, and preliminary data vital for MERIT projects to determine
mechanisms and test treatments."
10925328,"Abstract
In-hospital cardiac arrest occurs in nearly 300,000 hospitalized patients in the United States each year and
results in substantial morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the evidence base guiding the management of in-
hospital cardiac arrest is quite limited and society guidelines generally extrapolate data from the out-of-hospital
cardiac setting to inform in-hospital arrest care. As compared to out-of-hospital arrest, however, in-hospital
arrest victims tend to have more medical comorbidities, have a witnessed arrest, and be attended to by
professional first responders with advanced monitoring and treatment capabilities. Advanced airway
management is a key element of cardiac arrest resuscitation. The American Heart Association makes broad
recommendations regarding airway management during in-hospital cardiac, supporting endotracheal intubation
(a complex procedure requiring placement of an endotracheal tube through the vocal cords) and supraglottic
airway placement (a less complex advanced airway modality wherein the device is placed blindly in the
supraglottic space). Data from the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest setting has found that a supraglottic airway
strategy may be similar or superior to a more complex endotracheal intubation strategy. There is no
randomized data to guide practice in the in-hospital setting. We intend to address this knowledge gap by
performing the Hospital Airway Resuscitation Trial (HART)—a highly-innovative, pragmatic cluster-randomized
trial leveraging the unified clinical and research infrastructure within the Montefiore HealthSystem (New York
City) to conduct a first-of-its-kind in-hospital arrest trial in a highly diverse patient population. Specifically, a
mixture of academic and community hospitals within the MontefioreHealth system will be randomized to either
a strategy of first-choice endotracheal intubation or a strategy of first choice supraglottic airway, with
crossovers occurring at regular intervals. The primary outcome for the trial will be alive-and-ventilator-free
days, a common outcome in critical care trials that accounts for the impact of the intervention on both morbidity
and mortality. We hypothesize that in-hospital arrest patients managed with a strategy of first-choice
supraglottic airway will have more alive-and-ventilator-free days than those managed with a strategy of
endotracheal intubation. Secondary outcomes will include rates of return of spontaneous circulation, survival to
72-hours and 28-days, and functional status at discharge. In addition, we aim to understand mechanistic
explanations for the efficacy of airway management strategies by comparing accepted metrics of
cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality between groups. This will be done using data captured by state-of-the-art
bedside advanced cardiac monitors/defibrillators in use throughout the Montefiore system. We will enroll 1060
patients in this trial. The results of this trial promise to impact airway management strategies during in-hospital
cardiac arrest worldwide and, if our hypothesis is true, result in a substantial number of lives saved."
10922630,"STTR Project Summary/Abstract
It is estimated that every fourth to fifth death in the US is caused by a neurodegenerative disease
such as Alzheimer’s, AD related diseases, or Parkinson (CDC Wonder database, 2022;
Alzheimer’s Association, 2022). However, there are very few therapies or even molecular
diagnostic tools to detect these diseases, so the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and AD-related
neurodegenerative diseases relies primarily on cognitive assessments which typically only occur
with onset of dementia. With no diagnostic test available for the early detection of
neurodegeneration and no ability to differentiate between different neurodegenerative diseases
early on, it is unsurprising that over 43 % of primary care physicians report that they are
uncomfortable diagnosing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s (Alzheimer’s
Association, 2022). A diagnosis of ‘Alzheimer’s-type dementia’ also often serves as a placeholder
to describe a syndrome of memory loss that can result from various underlying disease causes,
and which may require different therapies. Therefore, we propose to use Covalent Protein
Painting (CPP), a novel platform technology that can detect, identify, and differentiate the
misfolded protein aggregates that characterize AD and related neurodegenerative diseases, to
develop a blood-based diagnostic test for neurodegeneration. Over 80% of primary care
physicians say they would welcome such a test, in particular if such a test could detect AD and
related diseases before patients are symptomatic or only show mild symptoms because it would
help them devise a therapy plan with their patient and allow them to be proactive. Better and
earlier diagnostics would also lead to better therapies, because one of the reasons so many
clinical trials for neurodegenerative drugs have failed is that participants are usually treated too
late, when symptoms are already apparent. Our test would allow earlier enrollment of patients in
clinical trials before too much damage has been done to the brain and would enable better
stratification of patient cohorts, both of which would accelerate and increase success chances of
clinical trials."
10923447,"Foot ulcers are a common and feared complication for people with diabetes. Each year one in twenty
people with diabetes develop a foot ulcer. One in five foot ulcers will become infected leading to lower
extremity amputation. The burden of diabetic foot ulcers is not equal across groups. Ulcers are more common
and have higher amputation rates in Black, Hispanic, and other non-White people.
 The pathway to ulceration is well established and involves multiple co-morbid conditions. People with
diabetes develop peripheral neuropathy and can have inadvertent trauma to their foot. The resulting wound
fails to heal, in part, because of peripheral arterial disease and poor glycemic control. People with a diabetic
foot ulcer also have a higher risk of dying within five years than people with diabetes, matched for co-
morbidities, without an ulcer. At least one in four people with a new diabetic foot ulcer will die within five years,
largely due to cardiovascular causes. The reasons for this accelerated mortality are not well defined but likely
involve disuse and inflammation. Part of ulcer treatment is to take pressure off the ulcer, known as off-loading.
This leads to prolonged loss of mobility as treatment takes months.
 People with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer are considered “in remission” as opposed to “cured”
because the underlying co-morbidities which led to their ulcer are still present. Once in remission, the current
standard of care is to slowly increase ambulation with appropriate footwear, so as not to promote ulcer
recurrence. The problem is that people rarely return to the recommended level of mobility. The ability to safely
maintain mobility with aging is critical. Although there are ongoing studies of the effect of exercise on ulcer
healing, we are aware of only one small, non-U.S. based clinical trial on exercise during “remission”. This is
likely because this population is typically excluded from exercise interventions. Like a person who has recently
recovered from a heart attack, this is a critical time to intervene to improve mobility and safely restore function
to improve long term outcomes.
 We hypothesize that a home-based exercise regimen will increase mobility and function without
increasing diabetic foot ulcer recurrence by improving lower extremity strength, lower extremity tissue
perfusion and glycemic control. In a clinical trial to assess feasibility and acceptability in a diverse population,
we will randomize 25 Veterans with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer to a 12-week home-based exercise
regimen or standard of care in a 3:1 ratio. The intervention is purposefully home-based to maximize access to
care. [Our primary objectives are to assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and estimate the
effect of the intervention on gait speed.] Our secondary objective is to estimate the effect of the intervention on
mobility and function including six-minute walk distance, the Modified Physical Performance Test, steps per
day and community mobility. Our exploratory objective will estimate the effect of the intervention on lower
extremity strength, perfusion of the foot and glycemic control. Our statistical hypothesis is that the changes in
outcome measures will be greater in the intervention arm compared with the control arm.
 Our short-term goal in this pilot study is to assess whether an acceptable, home-based exercise
regimen can be developed for Veterans with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer. Our proposed project has
clear potential for translation to clinical rehabilitation as a [telehealth group intervention] and could potentially
have a high impact on a population with a history of health disparities. If successful, our exercise intervention
will be tested in a future multi-site randomized clinical trial of people with a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer to
assess whether it: 1) increases mobility and function; 2) decreases major adverse cardiovascular events; and
3) decreases long-term ulcer recurrence. Our long-term goal is to improve functional outcomes for Veterans
with diabetic foot ulcer by improving their treatment and rehabilitation."

Prostate cancer is a curable disease when treated early before metastases occur. Current
diagnostic methods struggle to accurately predict which patients will develop metastases, resulting
in the development of advanced, incurable disease in some patients who initially present with
localized disease. We propose to tailor the development of our 3D spatial biology platform towards
predicting which prostate cancer patients will develop metastases. Our 3D spatial biology platform
is the basis for multiple prominent publications, has an international user base, and has
demonstrated compatibility with current laboratory workflows during our Phase I award studies.
The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Develop an accelerated and automated sample
preparation process, 2) Develop machine learning models to segment tissue structures and
extract 3D features for use in predictive models, and 3) Create a multiparameter model to predict
metastatic risk from prostate biopsy samples. The studies in this proposal will accelerate the
workflow to a clinically feasible turnaround time, build a predictive model, and demonstrate the
benefits of our technology in a defined prostate cancer patient subpopulation. Our partners in this
proposal (CorePlus) can rapidly deploy the developed technologies in a clinical laboratory with
regulatory accreditation and an existing referral base. Successful completion of this project will
position Alpenglow Biosciences towards an advanced stage in commercialization with high
potential for success. This project addresses the IMAT goal of developing substantially improved
cancer detection and risk assessment technologies."
10921703,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Older gay and bisexual men living with HIV (OGBMLH) are twice as likely to experience depression compared
to heterosexual and HIV-negative counterparts. Depression is now a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
among OGBMLH, exceeding that caused by HIV. Consistent with national trends, major contributing factors
are elevated rates of loneliness, social isolation, and lack of social support. Innovative interventions that
connect OGBMLH to services that increase social support and resilience to reduce depression and loneliness
are needed to improve the health and quality of life of OGBMLH. While many socially isolated OGBMLH could
benefit from community-building elder services such as congregate meal programs, bereavement groups,
support groups, and social gatherings, many do not access services, in part due to fear of discrimination.
Scalable efforts are needed to help OGBMLH struggling with depression and loneliness to overcome barriers
to engagement in existing social services that could significantly reduce depression and loneliness. We aim to
develop and refine a novel evidence-informed intervention, Bridge 2 Belonging (B2B), to reduce depression
and loneliness among OGBMLH by leveraging three evidence-based intervention strategies: cognitive
behavioral therapy-based friendship enrichment program (FEP), motivational interviewing (MI) communication
styles, and peer mentorship (PM). Guided by the ADAPT-ITT model, we will systematically solicit feedback on
these interventions from OGBMLH (n=30) and subsequently community experts (n=15) to iteratively inform an
innovative peer-delivered B2B intervention to increase participation in LGBTQ+ affirmative community-building
services to reduce symptoms of depression and loneliness, and secondarily improve physical health and
quality of life. We will then conduct a small proof-of-concept pilot (n=15) to assess the feasibility and
acceptability of the B2B intervention, including the produced manual and peer training. By systematically
adapting evidence-based content informed by stakeholder feedback, this R21 will produce and pilot a critically
needed intervention to increase engagement in affirmative community-building services to decrease
depression and loneliness, as well as improve physical health and quality of life among OGBMLH."
10927323,"Scientific Transparency: Project Summary
We introduce in this competing renewal the Scientific Transparency Core Module (STCM). This module places
the activities of the prior Image Analysis Core Module within a next-generation data curation framework, to
bring reproducible and shareable data analysis to VRC investigators. The STCM supports scientific rigor and
reproducibility in image analysis for VRC investigators, and provides support from the inception of an
innovative analysis approach, to its realization in code, to its application within a reproducible pipeline. Module
personnel support the development of innovative analysis tools. This core element of support continues from
the Image Analysis Core Module, which has been heavily used during the current funding cycle. We aim to
create automated, open-source analysis algorithms that provide reproducible results. Module personnel will
also support data curation and analysis pipelines. This module function is based around the commercial
Flywheel platform (http://flywheel.io). Brain imaging data obtained by Participating Investigators are already
being stored on this system; the STCM will underwrite the costs of placing retinal imaging data on this platform.
Module personnel will further assist investigators in placing analysis code within analysis “gears” that operate
on data stored in Flywheel. These are software containers that allow open-source analysis code to be
executed, without external dependencies, on virtually any computer hardware or operating system. These
components create documented, reproducible analysis pipelines that may be shared between VRC
investigators and with the larger vision science community."
10927359,"Cigarette smoking and intimate partner violence (IPV) are preventable, major public health concerns that result
in severe physical and psychological consequences. Women who have experienced IPV are more likely to suffer
from substance use, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder --all of which are risk factors for
smoking. Smoking prevalence among women who have experienced IPV is as high as 51% to 70%. American
Indian women, including Northern Plains Tribal women, experience the highest proportion of IPV among women
from any racial/ethnic group. Furthermore, smoking prevalence among Northern Plains Tribal women is among
the highest in the U.S and specifically among Northern Plains Tribal women who experienced IPV, 58% are
current smokers. Multiple health interventions have been developed for women who have experienced IPV,
including for alcohol and drug use given the high rates of these co-occurring problems. However, there have
been no smoking cessation interventions among them. Trauma-informed, mindfulness-based approaches are
shown to create physical, psychological, and emotional safety while mitigating habitual patterns of reactive or
addictive behaviors by increasing awareness of reactivity and automated (e.g., smoking) behavior, allowing
greater flexibility in response to cravings. These strength-based approaches are consistent with the values of
American Indian culture and create opportunities for individuals who have been traumatized to rebuild a sense
of choice and control. Our research team used an interactive, highly participatory approach to collect and use
qualitative data to inform the initial development of a culturally tailored, trauma-informed smoking cessation
intervention for Northern Plains Tribal women who have experienced IPV. Therefore, the primary objective of
this application is to finalize the 8-session novel intervention and test its feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction
among a group of 48 Northern Plains Tribal women smokers who have experienced IPV. To achieve this goal,
the following Aims will be addressed: 1) Use a community-based participatory approach with our Community
Advisory Board to refine intervention materials and finalize our pilot intervention methodology; 2) Conduct a
single arm intervention trial enrolling 48 Northern Plains Tribal women smokers who have experienced IPV to
examine the primary study outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with our culturally tailored,
trauma-informed mindfulness smoking cessation intervention and the secondary study outcome of quit attempts
and biochemically verified smoking abstinence prevalence at 3 and 6-months follow-up, which will gauge the
effectiveness of the intervention; and 3) As an exploratory aim, we will explore concurrent changes in drug and
alcohol use given the proposed intervention’s central focus on personal and historical trauma among American
Indian women as contributors to addiction and consistent with a focus on poly- vs. single substance."
10933921,"PROJECT SUMMARY CORE B
Core B has the overarching goal of supporting the Scientific Projects by providing reliable and readily available
clinical data from patients and will support the Project Investigators by collecting, processing, and analyzing a
rich multi-omics dataset from patients undergoing lung transplantation. Investigators in the Core will collect
detailed clinical data from lung transplant recipients and manually adjudicate clinical episodes and the diagnosis
of PGD and CLAD. Core B investigators will identify clinical and research procedures that will generate biologic
material and enroll patients in observational studies. Core B will work synergistically with the Core C investigators
to process the samples to generate single cell suspensions that will be analyzed using flow cytometry and single
cell RNA-sequencing/CITE seq, paired fixed tissue for spatial transcriptomics, and other assays. Core B will
apply robust machine learning approaches to organize clinical data and use this framework as a scaffold to
overlay longitudinally collected genomic and proteomic data collected over the clinical course of transplantation.
The resulting models of clinical PGD and CLAD will be used to identify biomarkers and generate hypotheses
about biologic pathways that will be causally tested in the Projects, credentialling the pathways as therapeutic
targets. Hence, Core B will directly support the Projects through the following aims. Aim 1. To enroll lung
transplant recipients for prospective tissue collection and data integration throughout longitudinal care.
We have developed integrated clinical and research teams to enable patient enrollment and collection of events
over the clinical course of patients. The clinical data extracted from the electronic health record will complement
the molecular phenotyping data and enable the Scientific Projects to test the hypotheses outlined. This integrated
model will facilitate the identification of biomarkers and clinical predictors of transitions in clinical state after
transplantation. Aim 2. To process, immunophenotype, and cryopreserve biological material from the lung
and esophagus collected as part of clinical care or research. We will leverage our experience with sample
collection, processing, flow cytometry, single cell RNA-sequencing, metabolomic and spatial transcriptomic
profiling to develop a robust multi-omics dataset of patients undergoing lung transplantation. Aim 3. To perform
next-generation sequencing assays, including single-cell RNA-seq, CITE-seq, and single cell TCR and
BCR clonotyping as well as spatial transcriptomics on selected samples. A major challenge in data science
has been the integration of large-scale datasets coming from multiple groups. Through collaborations with the
Chan Zuckerberg Human Cell Atlas Consortium, we have contributed to approaches based on transfer learning
that allow integration of single cell transcriptomic data rapidly and at scale. We will apply these approaches to
the multi-omics data collected from our patients to inform analyses proposed by the Project Investigators."
10933924,"The goal of this proposal is to elucidate physiologic mechanisms that promote gastric aspiration in lung transplant
recipients and identify molecular mechanisms by which microaspiration worsens PGD and CLAD. GERD is
extremely common in patients with chronic lung disease and lung transplant patients placing them at risk for
microaspiration of stomach contents. While investigators recognize microaspiration as a biologically plausible
contributor to lung transplant outcomes, data causally linking esophageal dysfunction and GERD-associated
microaspiration with graft dysfunction are lacking. Furthermore, whether the lung transplant procedure causes
esophageal dysfunction to promote GERD and CLAD is unknown. Given the prevalence of GERD after lung
transplant (as high as 75% in some series), some investigators recommend the routine use of fundoplication or
universal proton pump inhibitors following lung transplant but that has yielded inconsistent results in ameliorating
CLAD while suffering from attendant risks of therapy. We reason that elucidating the physiologic mechanisms
driving GERD can at a minimum better stratify patients for surgical therapies like fundoplication. Similarly,
understanding the molecular events linking microaspiration with PGD and CLAD can inform the development of
medical therapies to treat aspiration-induced injury to prevent or slow CLAD progression.
Lung restricted autoantibodies (LRA) against lung self-antigens have emerged among the strongest risk factors
for both PGD and CLAD in humans and mice. Multiple studies have shown that over a third of patients undergoing
lung transplantation have pre-existing LRA and up to 60-70% of those that are negative initially develop de novo
LRA within the first two years of transplantation, which is independently associated with increased CLAD risk. In
murine models, LRA drive the pathogenesis of PGD, prevent the development of allotolerance with co-
stimulatory blockade, and abrogate established allotolerance. Using a well-established murine model of CLAD
developed by a multinational team of investigators, we show exciting new data that acid aspiration results in the
de novo development of LRA through recruitment of neutrophils and monocyte derived alveolar macrophages
and by promoting antigen epitope spreading. We suggest direct and immunologic injury to the lung epithelium
in response to acid aspiration induces mitochondrial dysfunction leading to a pathologic activation of the ISR that
precludes epithelial repair. These data support our overarching hypothesis that physiologic dysfunction in the
esophagus and accompanying GERD predisposes to the recruitment of neutrophils and MoAM to the allograft
resulting in the generation of LRA while to worsen CLAD. We will test this using two interrelated aims:
Aim 1: To determine whether acid aspiration recruits neutrophils and monocyte-derived alveolar
macrophages to the graft that induce de novo lung-restricted autoantibodies and worsen CLAD.
Aim 2: To define the bidirectional functional relationship between respiration and esophageal clearance
in driving PGD and CLAD."
10933925,"Project Summary: For many patients with advanced lung disease, lung transplantation remains the only viable
therapeutic option to extend life. However, the 5-year survival for patients following lung transplantation is 54%,
the lowest among solid organ transplant recipients. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the leading
cause of morbidity and late mortality after lung transplantation. Up to a third of lung transplant recipients will
develop CLAD within 3 years post-transplant. Currently, there are no effective therapies to prevent or treat CLAD.
Hence, the identification of disease biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets are urgently needed to prevent or
treat CLAD and extend survival after lung transplantation. Distinct clinical phenotypes of CLAD have been
identified, including bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), however
clinical and pathologic overlap between these endotypes suggests shared pathogenic mechanisms. We present
preliminary data demonstrating that pathogenic profibrotic monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAM),
maintained via CSF1 signaling, represent a shared pathogenic mechanism between different forms of CLAD.
Based on our published and preliminary data, we propose to test hypothesis that autocrine, T cell- or
neutrophil-derived CSF1 signaling drives development of CLAD via maintenance of pathogenic MoAM.
We will test this hypothesis in two Specific Aims that include rigorous mechanistic experiments in mouse models
of CLAD (both BOS and RAS). We will credential our findings in humans by leveraging our expertise in electronic
health record analysis, machine learning approaches, and cellular and molecular analysis of small samples that
can be safely obtained from patients during standard-of-care surveillance procedures.
Aim 1: To determine whether cell type-specific CSF1/CSF1R signaling maintains MoAM to drive CLAD
pathogenesis. In Aim 1.1. will determine whether pathogenic macrophages are ontogenetically,
transcriptomically, and spatially distinct between BOS and RAS endotypes of CLAD. In Aim 1.2 we will use
pharmacologic CSF1R blockade and cell type-specific genetic ablation of CSF1 to determine the role of
autocrine, T cell- or neutrophil-derived CSF1 in the maintenance of pathogenic MoAM and development and
progression of BOS and RAS endotypes of CLAD.
Aim 2: To test whether emergence of pathogenic MoAM and loss of Tregs serve as cellular and molecular
biomarkers predictive of CLAD (BOS and RAS) development in lung transplant patients. With Project 1,
we will examine the impact of the presence and titers of LRA and PGD severity on these outcomes. With Project
2, we will examine the association between esophageal dysfunction and gastroesophageal reflux on the
recruitment and retention of MoAM after transplantation. With Project 4, we will determine whether PGD-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction in the epithelium results in enhanced recruitment of MoAM and CLAD progression in
both murine models and in patients."
10934264,"PROJECT 1: PROJECT ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most lethal and heterogeneous cancers. However, investigations of
intratumor heterogeneity, evolution, and therapeutic target selection in GBM rely on a tiny fraction of the whole
tumor. Precision therapies are therefore destined to fail if the target is heterogeneous. Conversely, tumor wide
targets likely arise in the earliest clonal expansion and should be present in most or all tumor cells. Similarly,
gene expression and epigenetic regulatory programs that are heterogeneous in a tumor may be driven by the
microenvironment or sub-clonal genetic alterations, whereas programs that are active in all tumor regions
could potentially represent the tumor’s cell lineage of origin. We hypothesize that an imaging-based tumor
wide approach will elucidate the genetic alterations of the earliest clonal expansion for each patient and the cell
lineage from which the tumor arises. The approach could also allow us to redefine tumor heterogeneity,
evolution, and target selection. To evaluate our hypothesis we will build an intratumor sample cohort from 25
newly diagnosed and 25 recurrent GBM, including patient-matched pairs. Each sample will have a 3D spatial
coordinate for mapping back into the corresponding 3-dimensional (3D) tumor representation we will create
(Aim 1). A ShinyApp will be designed for easy exploration of the data in the original context within the tumor. In
Aim 2, we will define the evolutionarily earliest tumor clone for each patient, including its genetic alterations
and the cell lineage from which the tumor arises. This will be accomplished by applying Hi-C epigenome
analysis and RNA sequencing, and other methods, to the samples from Aim 1. The assays are highly
complementary and provide comprehensive analyses of genome alterations, 3D chromatin contacts and the
gene expression programs they regulate. From preliminary profiles of 103 samples from 10 GBM patients we
discovered tumor wide genetic alterations and diverse, large scale structural variants from Hi-C data that have
a common feature – they produce gene fusions that are expressed tumor wide. We will distinguish
heterogeneous expression and gene regulatory programs from those that are tumor wide and may represent
the cell lineage of origin, as highlighted in our preliminary data. We will determine whether the tumor wide
genetic alterations and expression programs are retained over time. Heterogenous alterations and programs
will be explored for relationships with advanced imaging parameters. In Aim 3 we will determine the
transforming capacity and therapeutic value of tumor wide genetic alterations such as gene fusions that create
immunogenic neoantigens. By delineating the earliest tumor clone we will lay a foundation for human GBM cell
models that represent main root GBM cells of individual patients. Focusing on tumor wide targets will enable
development of therapeutic strategies that avoid a major source of treatment failure, broadly increasing the
opportunity for clinical impact. The data resource, The Cancer Genome Atlas equivalent for intratumor studies,
will be explorable from any computer with an internet connection."

recognized as a key early event in the development of AD. A non-invasive imaging method to detect and
assess early damaging neuroinflammation would be able to detect disease before irreversible damage occurs.
We at Einsenca are developing a PET imaging method to detect and monitor oxidative stress and consequent
damaging neuroinflammation in AD. Intellectual property protections will be critical to future commercialization
and ultimate clinical translation of these PET imaging methods. We request administrative supplement support
for technical assistance with these intellectual property protections. Currently Einsenca possesses limited
rights for development and validation of these PET imaging technologies that originated at academic partner
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). TABA support will be used to fund ahighly experienced attorney from
a full-service national law firm (Potomac Law Group) to evaluate the strength, validity, and enforceable nature
of the patents intended to be exclusively licensed by Einsenca along with anticipated freedom to operate and
commercialize the technology. Potomac Law Group will also assist Einsenca in the financial valuation of the
technology and draft, negotiate and conclude the definitive exclusive license agreement between Einsenca and
MGH. Finally, Potomac Law Group will draft templates and assist in negotiation of sponsored research,

10933241,"To harness the potential of text messaging to deliver research-driven HIV preventive information during
a critical age period, we developed and pilot tested In This toGether (ITG; R34MH109296), an HIV prevention
program developed specifically for, and with ongoing feedback from, 18-22 year-olds across Uganda. ITG is
one of the first comprehensive, text messaging-based HIV prevention programs developed and tested
nationally in any sub-Saharan African country. Findings from the R34 suggest that, despite the small sample
size (n=150) and the inclusion of youth across the HIV behavioral risk spectrum, ITG is associated with higher
rates of condom-protected sex (aIRR = 1.68, p<.001) and odds of HIV testing (aOR = 2.41, p = 0.03).
Here, we propose to build upon this promising R34 pilot by conducting a well-powered efficacy trial.
Reach will be expanded by translating the intervention into 3 additional languages. Specifically, we aim to:
Primary Aim: Measure the 12-month efficacy of ITG on HIV preventive behaviors for Ugandan
youth 18-22 years of age in a national RCT (n=750). We will conduct a 17-month RCT, thereby extending
our R34 work by increasing our observation period by 12 months and by having a fully powered sample size.
Primary Aim 1 a: Test whether ITG is more effective in HIV prevention when compared to control
conditions. Our main outcome measures will be: (i) the rate of condom-protected sex acts and (ii) HIV testing.
Secondary outcomes will be (iii) STI testing and (iv) the odds of PrEP uptake among those eligible.
Primary Aim 1 b: Using a fractional factorial-based MOST design, we will identify the impact that
intervention components have on behavior change. Participants who are in the intervention will be further
randomized to one of four arms predicated on having or not having the three interactive features: 1) Level Up
quiz questions; 2) milestone-driven Badges (e.g., carrying condoms); and 3) access to on-demand advice.
Secondary Aim: Assess RCT outcomes by factors associated with HIV acquisition: Sex,
urban/rural setting, and education. People who are women, live in urban areas, and have lower educational
attainment face higher HIV risk. We will further extend our R34 by examining here intervention impact for
important subgroups. Findings will inform potential future targeting and also adaptations of ITG.
Exploratory Aim: Measure the feasibility and acceptability of photo-verification of HIV testing.
The national reach of ITG results in a stronger public health potential than a localized intervention because
youth from varied backgrounds - particularly those outside of Kampala and without access to local healthcare
resources - can be engaged and affected. It also makes verification of HIV testing difficult because the
gathering of clinic data is complex even for local, let alone, national cohorts. As such, we will pilot a photo
verification procedure that Dr. Bogart innovated with a different population in a different region.
The Ministry of Health will guide us on sustainability should the findings of this R01 warrant."
10935304,"OVERALL ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The mission of this Penn PO1 Center on “Mechanisms underlying heterogeneity of cognitive outcome in
synucleinopathy” is to understand why the same underlying core pathology – inclusions of alpha-synuclein
(aSyn) – varies so widely in the pace and pattern of spread within the brain, resulting in dramatically divergent
clinical trajectories. The Lewy body disorders (LBD) – namely, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s
disease (PD), and Alzheimer’s disease with Lewy bodies (LBD+AD) – share the core feature of neuronal aSyn
inclusions. However, patients manifest very differently from one another, with differences in cognition playing a
vital role with respect to patient quality of life and cost to the healthcare system. Because the LBD affect so
many, with no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies, they constitute one of the most important Alzheimer’s
Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) affecting the world today. This PO1 Center hypothesizes that several key
features play fundamental roles in determining whether a given LBD individual might develop dementia from the
outset, after a few years, after many decades, or not at all. These features are: (1) the interplay of aSyn with -
amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles, (2) the conformation of aSyn, (3) host genomics and proteomics,
and (4) the locus/entry point of early pathology. We test this hypothesis in four synergistic Research Projects.
Project I investigates the role of concomitant -amyloid and tau pathology in governing patterns of aSyn spread
in human postmortem brain. Project II characterizes human brain-derived aSyn strains with cryo-ET and cell
biological techniques. Project III leverages genomic and biomarker data to derive candidate molecular players,
then manipulates these genes/proteins in neurons to understand their role in the uptake of fibrillar aSyn,
development of aSyn pathology, and cell-to-cell transmission of aSyn pathology. Project IV extends our
investigations of host factors to mouse models, testing the role of genetic background, route of aSyn exposure,
and type of aSyn strain in modulating in vivo pathological aSyn spread. All four research projects focus on
mechanisms, grounded in human data, and they are supported by four Cores that (1) serve Administrative
functions, (2) recruit Clinical patients, (3) provide biosample Resources to Research Projects and to external
investigators, and (4) manage Data for Research Projects and sharing to external investigators. Thus, the Penn
PO1 Center seeks to discover and develop new therapeutic strategies to delay or prevent dementia in the LBD."
10935305,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core of the proposed NIA PO1 Center at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Perelman
School of Medicine (PSOM) is key to accomplishing the goals of all Project and other Cores. The proposed PO1
Center focuses on priorities that address Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the topic areas
of Lewy body disorders (LBD), and multiple etiology dementias, with projects that all address the central question
of why some LBD patients develop cognitive decline early, while others develop these symptoms much later, or
not at all. We focus on mechanisms, with the goal of deriving insights that may lead to much-needed therapies
for these pathological processes. We center our program in human-derived materials, leveraging the
longstanding collection of human brain tissue and biofluids from individuals with neurodegenerative disorders at
our center.
The seven Specific Aims for the Administrative Core fall into three clusters.
Aims 1, 2, and 3 broadly support the Research Projects by (1) overseeing fiscal and budgetary matters, (2)
enhancing synergy within the PO1 Center by organizing internal meetings, including “inverted meetings,” and
(3) conducting reviews of the PO1 Center by an External Advisory Committee, which will include one individual
affected by LBD (as patient, caregiver, or other lay advocate).
Aims 4, 5, and 6 increase the impact of the Center’s activities by (4) fostering dissemination of research findings
from the Projects and Cores, (5) staying up to date on NIH policies concerning human subjects, data sharing,
resource sharing, and informing all investigators within the Center to ensure compliance, and (6) sharing human
biosamples, human biosample-derived strains, and PO1 center data with outside investigators, in collaboration
with the Resource Core and the Data Management and Statistics Core.
Aim 7 leverages the interdisciplinary nature of the PO1 center to develop translational researchers."
10935306,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (CLINICAL CORE)
The Clinical Core of the proposed NIA P01 at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Perelman School of
Medicine will be crucial to accomplishing the goals of all Projects and other Cores of this multidisciplinary
research program. The proposed UPenn NIA P01 will focus on priorities that address Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and related dementias (ADRD) in topic areas of multiple etiology dementias, such as Lewy body (LB) disorders
(LBD), including Parkinson’s disease (PD) dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). During life,
LBD patients manifest very differently from one another, with DLB patients demonstrating dementia from
disease onset, whereas PD patients initially show motor symptoms predominantly. Moreover, although some
PD patients do go on to develop cognitive dementia, others do not, and even among those who develop PDD,
the pace varies widely – with cognitive symptoms developing over months to decades. The overall goals of this
new UPenn P01 is to understand why the same underlying core pathology – inclusions of aSyn – varies so
widely in the pace and pattern of spread within the brain, resulting in dramatically different clinical trajectories.
We focus on mechanisms, with the goal of intervening in these pathological processes. This mechanistic focus,
grounded in human data, is key to preventing the cognitive decline and dementia that currently affect so many.
The aims for the Clinical Core are to: (1) recruit, assess and retain research participants with LBD for
P01Projects I-IV; (2) collaborate with the Resource Core for biomarker/biofluid and tissue collection from
existing and new Clinical Core LBD participants, and to assess them longitudinally antemortem for as long as
possible to optimize clinical-pathological correlations; and (3) collaborate with Data Management and Statistics
Core to contribute high-quality clinical and biomarker data to the UPenn Integrated NeuroDegenerative
Disease Database (INDD) and facilitate sharing of clinical and biomarker data within and outside of UPenn with
new and longstanding internal, national and international collaborators."
10935663,"SUMMARY CORE B: Genetics Core for Mucin Degrading Bacteria
The intestinal microbiota comprises diverse bacteria, a subset of which are capable of
degrading the host-derived mucins that are a primary component of the intestinal mucus layer.
Excessive erosion of the mucus layer is linked to poor health outcomes in many contexts,
including patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, where it is associated with the
development of neutropenic fever. As an essential component of the P01, we will develop a
Genetics Core for Mucin Degrading Bacteria. The Core will support the three related projects in
investigating the mechanisms and regulation of mucin degradation by the prevalent mucin
degraders Akkermansia and Bacteroides spp. Our lab has specialized expertise in the genetic
manipulation of these strictly anaerobic bacteria and contributed to developing the first set of
genetic tools for Akkermansia. The primary functions of the Core will be to: (1) generate mutants
in bacterial isolates and apply high-throughput genetic screens, (2) provide mutants in specific
genes of interest and engineer strains for recombinant protein expression, (3) provide analysis
of mucin degradation using fluorescently labelled glycans as well as human colonic mucin
reagent, and (4) support bioinformatic analysis of metagenomic sequencing data, including
strain identification and comparative genomics, as well as provide access to external glycan
expertise. We will combine the results from the individual projects to develop a database of
mucin degrading enzymes that will serve as a resource to the research community. By providing
strains and reagents to gain a mechanistic understanding of bacterial mucin degradation, the
proposed Core will be integral to the three proposed projects"
10935664,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY: Mucin-preserving strategies to reduce allo HCT toxicities
 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) is a standard therapy for a variety of benign
and malignant hematological diseases. Despite ongoing advances, it remains a high-risk treatment modality,
due in large part to the risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a severe inflammatory condition
that commonly afflicts the intestinal tract and can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. Work from
multiple groups over the past decade have demonstrated that gut microbiota (GM) injury commonly precedes
GVHD and subsequent treatment-related mortality (TRM).
 The most common source of GM injury in allo HCT patients are antibiotics, which are given to treat life-
threatening infections that commonly arise in these immune-compromised patients. We recently reported
(Hayase, et al, Cell, 2022) that one antibiotic, meropenem, is both associated with increased intestinal GVHD
in allo HCT patients and can aggravate experimental GVHD in mouse models. One major mechanism appears
to be antibiotic-mediated selection of mucus-degrading Bacteroides, which then leads to erosion of colonic
mucus and increased bacterial translocation.
 Neutropenic fever is another common toxicity of all HCT, and we recently published our findings that
Akkermansia and Bacteroides, both of which can degrade mucins, were associated with development of
neutropenic fever (Schwabkey, et al, Sci Transl Med, 2022). Experiments in mice with antibiotic-mediated
depletion of these bacteria, as well as re-introduction of these bacteria, demonstrated that Akkermansia and
Bacteroides species synergize to produce thermodysregulation and compromise intestinal mucus in mouse
models of HCT conditioning.
 In preliminary experiments, have begun to characterize the individual contributions of Akkermansia and
Bacteroides to intestinal GVHD, and have also identified conditions which lead to their expansion and
upregulation of mucus-degrading enzymes. Based on this knowledge, we are developing non-antibiotic
strategies to suppress mucus-degrading behavior by these otherwise usually benign commensal bacteria.
 In this Project, we will further explore the diet-microbiota-mucin axis is a targetable modifier of intestinal
GVHD risk. Our Aims are: 1) To examine how mucus-degrading intestinal bacteria are associated with
intestinal GVHD, and 2) To examine potential efficacy of novel translational strategies to target mucus-
degrading intestinal bacteria in reducing GVHD. Strategies include oral administration of xylose,
propionate, and the naphthoquionone MNQ."

Epigenomics of Development and Disease
 GENOMICS CORE
SUMMARY
Established in 2014 during Phase 1 of the COBRE Epigenomics of Development and Disease, the Genomics
Core (GC) has become an indispensable go-to resource at the University of North Dakota (UND). The principal
mission of the GC is to support original epigenomics research and foster collaborations within and outside of the
Epigenetics Working Group (EWG). The GC provides expertise and technology for the bench (wet) and
bioinformatics (dry) stages of projects from preparation of specimens for high-throughput sequencing to
bioinformatics analyses of epigenomics data. The GC also facilitates management, storage and sharing of
sequencing data including public access compliance. Finally, the GC educates the research community on
incorporating big-data technologies into biomedical research. Based on the accomplishments of GC-supported
research and the growth of its user base in COBRE 1 and 2, the demand for GC services is expected to further
increase through the next several years. COBRE 3 will be dedicated to building on the foundation of COBRE 1
and 2 to accomplish sustainability in all three aspects of the GC’s operation. Aim1 will maintain the momentum
for the wet laboratory services by improving reliability and cost-efficiency of sample preparation and access to
improved technologies. Aim 2 will establish a Program Income charge system for bioinformatics services by
offering the options of dedicated bioinformatician’s time and cloud-based data analyses platform. Aim 3 will
increase the pool of external GC users by engaging investigators from nearby universities that lack genomics
facilities as well as establishing collaborations with IDeA grantees and Industry partnerships. These initiatives
will help the GC maintain its services tailored to the needs of users, lower the barriers for new users to enter the
field of epigenomics and, taken together, help achieve long-term sustainability of the GC and success of the
EWG."
10938723,"Each puff of an e-cigarette generates micromolar amounts dihydroxyacetone (DHA) from the combustion of
propylene glycol and glycerol. Up to 40-55% of e-liquid content is converted to DHA in each puff from an e-
cigarette, making DHA a high-volume component found in all e-cigarette vapors, which the vaper inhales with
each puff of the e-cigarette. DHA is approved for external use as a sunless tanning agent, but serious
concerns have been raised about inhalation exposures through spray tanning and now e-cigarette use. We
have shown that DHA is genotoxic, cytotoxic, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction in skin and kidney cells,
but the effects of inhalation exposures to DHA are currently unknown. The long-term goal of the proposal is the
identification and validation of markers for cellular and metabolic stress induced by DHA exposure that can be
examined in tissues from vapers to understand the consequences of repeated inhalation exposures to DHA.
The objective of this proposal is to address the gap in existing studies, which have only focused on skin
models, by examining the exposure effects of DHA at both acute and chronic doses in pulmonary and
cardiovascular cells. Our central hypothesis is that exposure to DHA alters metabolic pathways, promotes
oxidative stress, disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis, and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. The rationale for this
work is that DHA exposures to the lung and cardiovascular system allow direct absorption of DHA into cells.
DHA-induced changes in metabolism and mitochondrial function would compromise overall cellular function,
leading to disease. Three specific aims will test the central hypothesis: 1) DHA incorporation into metabolic
pathways alters glycolysis and induces glycosylation protein damage; 2) DHA exposure alters NAD(P)H pools
inducing oxidative stress, and 3) DHA exposure alters cytosolic Ca2+ levels and disrupts mitochondrial
function. The first aim will test the sub-hypothesis that DHA alters metabolic pathways by tracing DHA
metabolism using isotopologues of DHA and identifying metabolite disequilibrium. The second aim will test the
sub-hypothesis that an excess of DHA changes cofactor pools and induces oxidative stress. The third aim will
test the sub-hypothesis that DHA alters Ca2+ signaling to induce mitochondrial dysfunction, in addition to
causing metabolic stress and oxidation-reduction imbalance. The study is innovative because it extends
beyond the genotoxic and cytotoxic characterization of DHA to measure DHA’s ability to reprogram pulmonary
and cardiovascular cells metabolically. The research is significant because e-cigarette users are chronically
exposed to DHA, which will directly impact pulmonary and cardiovascular cell homeostasis and cause severe
declines in cellular function or even induce cell death. This work will establish essential markers for DHA
exposure to allow future epidemiological work to associate DHA exposure to disease."
10937787,"Project Summary/Abstract
Early-stage development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for hazardous chemicals can be complicated by
several factors, including limited expertise in working with highly toxic and restricted chemicals and a diverse
array of experimental models of varying relevance. We propose to establish the Wake Forest University Vesicant
Exposure Resource and Coordination Core (Vesicant ExRC) to provide a comprehensive suite of experimental
models, innovative analytical methods and interactive study design protocols to support CCRP investigators. Dr.
McNutt will serve as the overall Director of the Vesicant ExRC. He will be joined by a multidisciplinary scientific
team with extensive expertise in vesicant studies and an administrative team with proven experience in
managing large, multi-institutional programs under BARDA, NIH and DoD funding. The overall goal of the
Vesicant ExRC is to take advantage of our established expertise studying vesicant injury in vivo and in vitro to
develop a state-of-the-art facility that accelerates and enhances fundamental and translational studies. Our
approach is enabled by the established repertoire of well-characterized experimental models used at Wake
Forest to study fundamental effects of vesicants on ocular, dermal and pulmonary tissues. The experimental
methods will focus on three primary models; in vivo studies using mouse and rabbit preclinical models of corneal
injury; ex vivo exposures using commercially procured eyes for acute and mechanistic studies; and in vitro
studies using phenotypically mature, full-thickness upper airway and skin microphysiological models. The
Vesicant ExRC will be organized and executed through five specific aims: (1) Establish the Vesicant ExRC as a
collaborative vesicant research resource; (2) Enhance collaborative studies through advanced analytical
methods; (3) Ensure effective communication and coordination between Vesicant ExRC and stakeholders; (4)
Develop resources to education stakeholders and disseminate standardized methods and findings; and (5)
transition the Vesicant ExRC to become a sustainable resource. These aims will be achieved through the
development and coordination of an Administrative Core, Coordination Core and Research Support Core to
manage ExRC operations; establishment of a Steering Committee and External Advisory Committee to provide
strategic guidance; implementation of facility website for scheduling, marketing and communications; and
education of stakeholders and the broader CCRP Network in experimental approaches. The ability of the
Vesicant ExRC to rapidly develop, standardize and disseminate proven methods for the study of highly toxic
vesicants is anticipated to directly enhance the CCRP mission by accelerating fundamental studies into toxic
mechanisms and improving early-stage MCM development."

PROJECT SUMMARY:
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and tic disorders, including Tourette Syndrome (TS) are severe
neuropsychiatric conditions thought to involve disrupted dopamine signaling within cortico-basal ganglia neural
circuits. Despite this association, existing neuroimaging research on D2 and D3 dopamine receptor binding has
yielded inconsistent results, possibly owing to poorly understood genetic variations that affect dopamine
function. This proposed supplement aims to fill this knowledge gap by augmenting an existing parent grant
(5R01MH130609), which utilizes positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-PHNO to study D2/D3 receptor
binding in adults with OCD and tics (15 OCD, 15 OCD+tics, 15 tics, 15 controls). In Aim 1, the supplement
proposes whole-genome sequencing for all study participants, enabling the calculation of polygenic risk scores
specifically for OCD and TS. This will allow for investigations into the association between common genetic risk
factors and D2/D3 receptor binding potential. Aim 2 involves generating dopamine receptor polygenic co-
expression indices based on post-mortem human brain gene expression data. This will enable us to test
whether co-expression modules involving dopamine receptor genes (DRD2 and DRD3) affect dopamine
binding within basal ganglia regions. Aim 3 will focus on understanding the distinct impact of genetic variants
within canonical dopamine-related genes on D2/D3 receptor binding. Additionally, exploratory analyses will be
conducted to examine the contributions of rare genetic variants to D2/D3 receptor binding. Overall, this
supplemental study employs an innovative imaging-genetics integration approach, leveraging whole-genome
sequencing to understand the complex genetic factors that influence dopamine receptor alterations pertinent to
OCD and tic pathophysiology. The findings are expected to inform the development of much needed novel,
targeted therapeutic interventions. Concurrently, the study will offer specialized mentoring and training in
statistical genetics and multi-omic data integration, providing the trainee with valuable skills essential for a
productive career in translational neurogenetics research."
10938453,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The general population continues to be at risk of exposure to ionizing radiation because of nuclear warfare,
terrorism, or radiological accidents. Such exposures are known to cause both short- and long-term injuries in
multiple organ systems. Hence, there is an urgent need for FDA-approved biomarkers, with the ability to
accurately determine radiation exposure and predict injuries that may follow, based on easily accessible biofluids
(e.g., blood) from exposed individuals. The reconstruction of absorbed dose alone does not necessarily identify
the type and degree of radiation injury, information that is required for triage and treatment decisions. Thus,
effective medical management of a suspected high-dose (i.e., life threatening) exposure necessitates a multiple-
parameter-based approach to combine biodosimetry and injury biomarker endpoints. This proposed supplement
brings together three inter-disciplinary research teams with expertise in radiation biology, animal models of tissue
injury, biomarker development, biostatistics, and bioinformatics to develop the first concept of an analytically
validated rapid and minimally invasive assay that constructs both absorbed radiation dose and predicts radiation
injury. For this purpose, we will for the first time perform studies to integrate our previously developed FAST-
DOSE tool that makes use of leukocyte protein biomarkers, designed for rapid retrospective dose
classification/reconstruction within a week after exposure with our CardioWatch panel, a plasma multi-omics
panel that predicts the development of late injury in the heart before clinical manifestations are apparent. We will
make use of use a highly translational rat model of leg-out X-ray partial body irradiation, which will allow us to
collect data on a wide range of early and late organ injuries. Peripheral blood samples collected up to 3 months
after irradiation will be used to validate both the FAST-DOSE tool and CardioWatch panel. Echocardiography
will provide data on cardiac function at time points up to 9 months after irradiation. Performing these studies in
one set of animals will allow us to integrate both assays, using state of the art machine learning approaches.
Innovation lies in the different strengths and capabilities of these two biomarker systems which can be used in
tandem to correlate in vivo dose reconstruction with radiation injury. The goal of our collaborative supplement is
to build on an existing infrastructure and share samples for maximum output. Moreover, the work proposed
herein, falls well within the original scope of both approved projects, and speaks to the common goal of building
biomarker panels for radiation-specific molecular alterations."
10938464,"Multi-organ culture and pumping systems for ex vivo models of immunity in hybrid tissue-chips
A better understanding of cellular and molecular communication between the lymph node (LN) and the organs it
drains is imperative for public health. These events determine how well we fight infections and respond to
vaccines, whether a nascent tumor is recognized and destroyed, and whether our own tissues remain safe from
autoimmunity. However, the dynamic interactions of the lymph node with peripheral organs have been difficult
to study in vivo or in vitro, making it difficult to predict immune responses, understand disease mechanisms, or
design vaccines and immunotherapies. Here, we will develop a microfluidic culture and pumping system
specifically designed to model communication between the lymph node and surrounding organs, to model multi-
tissue immunity. This model will build on our prior establishment of a microfluidic system for co-culture of two
slices under a recirculating loop of media, which showed promise in capturing tumor-induced
immunosuppression of the lymph node (Shim, Lab Chip 2019). We will build on this concept to create the first
tissue slice co-culture system that is specifically designed for use by immunologists and other biomedical
researchers in terms of ease of use for precise flow control and circulation of white blood cells between tissues.
First, we will develop a series of 3D printed multi-organ microdevices for culture of intact tissue slices under
transverse or lateral perfusion, with or without an air/liquid interface (e.g. for brain and skin slices), and supporting
recirculation of white blood cells through multiple tissues. In parallel, we will refine the fluidic control system for
robust and user-friendly multi-slice co-cocultures and lymphocyte recirculation, with scale up to dozens of slice
cultures. We will start from our recent prototype on-chip magnetic impeller-based pump, which is compatible with
cell culture incubators and cell recirculation (Cook, Lab Chip 2022). Combining advanced fluid dynamic
simulations with experimental tests, we will miniaturize the pump to reduce dead volume, ensure consistency of
flow control, and preserve viability of circulating white blood cells. User tests in other laboratories will further
refine the design. Making use of the available flow control, we will test the hypothesis that lymph node tissue
function is sensitive to fluid flow rate, and determine the optimal flow mode for multi-organ lymph node culture.
Finally, we will build on our strong team’s expertise in vaccine immunology to generate a simple model of vaccine
drainage and response of the lymph node to vaccination, as a proof-of-principle for the system. Ultimately, the
user-friendly platform developed here to model multi-organ immune function will enable the biomedical research
community to better predict the response to vaccination and immunotherapy, onset of tumor immunity, and
engagement of brain, gut, or arthritic joints with the lymph node during autoimmunity."
10939217,"PROJECT SUMMARY
At odds with common assumptions — and hope, pregnancy ends in preterm birth (PTB) for approximately 1 in
10 women. Yearly PTB affects 15 million infants worldwide and 386,580 in the United States. PTB is the
leading cause of global, and U.S., neonatal mortality and morbidity and is associated with future risk for poor
physical (higher blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, wheeze/asthma) and mental (ADHD, IQ decrements)
health. Maternal health is not spared: women who deliver preterm are at an increased risk for depression,
hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease later in life. In the U.S., the racial and ethnic disparities in PTB
rates are dramatic and independent of socio-economic status (SES): overall, 14.12% for Non-Hispanic Black
compared to 9.09% for Non-Hispanic White women. Psychosocial stress and childhood trauma each are
associated with risk for PTB. PTB has an intergenerational impact: mothers born preterm are more likely to
give birth preterm, especially amongst Black women. Literature proposing psychosocial and physiologic
pathways between maternal stress and PTB demonstrate significant differences in self-reported and biologic
markers of stress between non-Hispanic Black and White women. Racial and ethnic differences have also
been reported in dietary behaviors in response to acute stress and economic adversity from food insecurity.
We aim to identify nutritional profiles of pregnant women with food insecurity and psychosocial stress,
determine racial and ethnic differences in nutritional profiles by food insecurity and psychosocial stress
experiences, and evaluate whether nutritional profiles affect the pathway by which food- and psychosocial-
related stress contributes to increased risk for PTB among racial and ethnic minoritized women. In a sample of
post-attrition n=175 pregnant women we will test the following two aims: Aim 1: To determine whether there are
unique nutritional profiles (self-reported maternal dietary quality and serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D level) of
pregnant women with food insecurity and psychosocial stress (anxiety, depression, perceived stress) that differ
by race and ethnicity. Aim 2: To evaluate if maternal prenatal nutrition mediates the association between food-
and psychosocial-related stress and earlier gestational age (GA) at birth and if this mediation is moderated by
race and ethnicity. This new conceptual framing of PTB that incorporates dietary intake and quality is
important to identify new biologic and behavioral mechanisms for PTB risk that will inform future interventions
that can reduce PTB and dietary disparities."

 Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects approximately one-third of humans worldwide and
causes toxoplasmosis, a neglected infectious disease in the United States. Although most human infections are
mild or asymptomatic, T. gondii infection can result in life-threatening disease in immunocompromised
individuals and in the developing fetus due to congenital infection, underscoring the role of the host immune
system in controlling the parasite. Although it is well documented that neutrophils infiltrate the site of acute T.
gondii infection, there is limited understanding of how human neutrophils respond to T. gondii. As therapeutic
strategies are still limited, and no vaccine is available, there is a critical need to uncover the pertinent innate
immune responses to T. gondii infection. Neutrophils control infectious pathogens by a variety of mechanisms,
including the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The production of ROS has been demonstrated in T.
gondii-infected neutrophils; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in these processes and
their contribution to parasite killing are unknown. In the current proposal, we will: i) Determine the cellular events
required to induce ROS in T. gondii-infected neutrophils, ii) Determine which receptors are associated with T.
gondii recognition and ROS production, iii) Determine whether T. gondii-induced ROS is mediated by the Nox2-
dependent or Nox2-independent (mitochondrial) pathway in neutrophils, and iv) Determine whether ROS and
phagosome maturation contribute to neutrophil-mediated T. gondii killing. We will use primarily the cell line HL-
60, which is a developmental precursor of neutrophils and can be differentiated into neutrophil-like cells (NLCs)
for functional tests. This is a suitable model that allows us to decipher signaling pathways by using genetic loss-
of-function experiments. Additionally, we will confirm our central findings in primary human neutrophils isolated
from healthy blood donors. Our preliminary data on NLCs and primary human neutrophils have indicated that
these cells produce ROS and kill phagocytosed parasites. The rationale for this project is the relevance of
understanding the very early immune events that affect the progression of the host response and the disease.
Completion of these studies is therefore expected to have a significant impact by providing foundational
knowledge that can affect our ability to develop therapeutics, thus controlling T. gondii spread to sites such as
the heart and the brain and attenuating disease pathogenesis."
10937066,"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest single provider of heath care to individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. For 2016, Paralyzed Veterans of America estimates that 43,000
veterans with SCI received care from VHA. The annual cost of that care is substantial. In 2015, the total costs
during the first year following an SCI ranged from $520K to $1.1M; recurring costs ranged from $69K to $185K
per patient per year. Lifetime costs also continue to increase as life expectancy post-SCI increases. A key
contributor to the high medical cost post-SCI is fragility fracture, often requiring prolonged hospitalization and
specialized care. Up to three-quarters of individuals with SCI will sustain a fragility fracture in their lifetime.
Fractures lead to serious medical complications, a loss of independence, and a loss of productivity, all resulting
in substantial direct and indirect costs. SCI clinicians and patients agree that maintaining an active lifestyle is
critical not only for general health, but also for musculoskeletal health. Given the substantial loss of bone that
occurs in the lower limbs following SCI, however, clinicians must always be cognizant of the possibility of
fracture, especially for those with more chronic injuries.
 Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement from a Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scan is the
clinical gold standard for osteoporosis assessment in able-bodied individuals. Accurate diagnosis is important
since it guides treatment and it helps to inform patients and doctors what activities can and can't be performed
safely. Unlike the case with able-bodied individuals, there is no clinical standard and no consensus for
assessing skeletal health in the lower limbs of individuals with SCI. For able-bodied individuals, the standard
sites for scanning are the spine and hip, which are common sites of fracture in those with age-related
osteoporosis. For those with SCI, however, most fractures occur just above and just below the knee. Hip and
spine BMD are not good predictors of fracture at distal sites in the legs and, at present, no standardized
protocols exist for assessing skeletal health near the knee. SCI clinicians continue to be faced with a critical
question which is: Is it safe for my patient to participate in certain rehabilitation activities, recreation and sports
activities, or to use an exoskeleton for ambulation? Currently, there is no evidence-based answer to that
question. The purpose of this project is to validate scan protocols for bone mineral density assessment that will
enable clinicians to address that issue. This in turn will allow clinicians to prescribe and monitor rehabilitation
therapies and recreational activities that are appropriate for a particular patient given his or her skeletal heath.
 Over the past three decades more than a dozen different protocols have been proposed for scanning the
area above and below the knee in patients with SCI, including nine protocols introduced since 2005. Those
protocols have not been comprehensively assessed or compared for sensitivity or precision, nor have
normative, reference values been determined for able-bodied individuals. Our study has four Specific Aims.
Aim 1 is to generate normative databases for the multiple DXA protocols that have been proposed for bone
density scanning of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Aim 2 is to determine and rank the precision of those
protocols in able-bodied individuals. Aim 3 is to the determine precision for the knee DXA protocols examined
in Aim 1, but in individuals with SCI >4 years post-injury, and to see if High-Resolution QCT and peripheral-
QCT scanning provide clinically valuable complementary data compared to DXA. Aim 4 is to measure bone
changes over time in patients 1 to 4 years post-injury and, for DXA, to compare those changes to the least
detectable change determined from the precision for each candidate knee DXA protocol. The results of this
study will have immediate clinical utility and will lay the groundwork for future development of a fracture risk
assessment tool specific for persons with SCI, comparable to risk assessment tools already available for able-
bodied individuals. Clinical implementation of validated DXA protocols will be the immediate next step."
10933716,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advancing our understanding of the neural basis of human cognition is limited due to the rarity of intracranial
recordings in humans, and the inherent inadequacy of animal models. Additionally, studying something as
complex and flexible as executive function will likely require recording from hundreds of neurons
simultaneously, a scenario not currently possible in humans with the existing recording technology. Here we
propose to use a new probe, the Neuropixels probe, with 960 possible recording electrodes on a single shank,
to study human executive function. Placing these Neuropixels probes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
during awake deep brain stimulation recordings, we will assess the neural population activity during an
executive function task that employs feature selection, conflict processing, and decisions (Aims 1 and 2).
Making use of the unique recording structure of the probe, with electrodes placed regularly along the shank,
we will evaluate the local topography, expecting cortical layers to stratify neural responses to task-conditions
(Aim 1). We will also evaluate the neural population response to task conditions, hypothesizing that the neural
dimensions and geometry exhibit features that explain the flexibility so crucial to executive function (Aim 2).
This study will establish the neural underpinnings of human executive function."

Transportation is a major factor impacting the upstream social determinants of health, yet the system in the United States is fragmented and inefficient for those seeking healthcare services within the inner-city and who depend on public transit. This includes individuals who are unable to drive, afford a personal vehicle and are forced to rely on public transit, which is often unreliable and poses health or safety concerns. The result is a lack of access to health resources including preventive and routine followup care. Research demonstrates a lack of transportation has negative consequences on access to healthcare. However, research examining the effect of a comprehensive transportation intervention on overall health is missing. To fill this gap Feonix - Mobility Rising, and its partners, advocate for the implementation of Transportation Assistance Hubs (TAH) in Dallas, Texas and Detroit, Michigan.

A TAH includes the deployment of Mobility as a Service, a mobility wallet, and debit card, which will work similarly to the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card that is used for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The TAH also includes a Mobility Navigator who provides riders assistance to optimize their transportation budget and support using new modes of transportation. The aim of the project is to show that by providing access to transportation and support in navigating resources, riders will experience improvements in health and well-being. This project will focus on individuals with less privileged socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic minority groups in communities of persistent poverty and Justice40-identified disadvantaged communities."

This renewal application seeks continued support for the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM)
and Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) training grant in cancer prevention and
control (CPC). We had two funding cycles of an R25 “Postdoctoral Training Program in Cancer Survivorship”
and are in the final year of a subsequent renewal of “CAPACiTy: Cancer Prevention and Control Training
Program” (R25CA122061; T32CA122061). The R25 grant provided support for mentored training of cancer
survivorship researchers from 2008 to 2018. During the transition from R25 to T32, we expanded training to
include the entire cancer control continuum (2019 to present). The expanded focus aligned with new aims of
the WFBCCC CPC program, new scientific members, and a robust funding portfolio in cancer prevention, early
detection, and survivorship. Since 2019, WFUSM has made considerably investments to advance translational
science by expanding programs and faculty in implementation science, informatics, learning health systems
science, and team science. The WFBCCC has also expanded its focus on cancer care delivery research and
serves as 1 of 2 academic institutions with an NCI Community Oncology Research Program Research Base.
We are in a unique position to evolve and expand our training program in cancer control aligned with
institutional priorities and investments. The overall goal of this training grant renewal is to support training of
12 new post-doctoral fellows in the skills and competencies needed to conduct independent and translational
cancer control research. Key features include: 1) Recruitment of promising post-doctoral fellows with a keen
interest in a translational research career in cancer prevention and control; 2) Alignment with a primary mentor
and mentoring team comprised of T32 program faculty, who are PIs or Co-Is in cancer control research and/or
subject matter experts in translational science; 3) Individualized didactic and experiential training facilitated by
an Individualized Development Plan; 4) Exceptional infrastructure and environment for training and
development of skills in rigorous and reproducible research methods, translational science, and the
responsible conduct of research; 5) Experienced program leadership with complementary strengths in cancer
control research, implementation science, informatics, cancer care delivery, health systems science, and team
science; 6) Expansion and engagement of 31 Multi-Disciplinary Preceptors from 12 Departments and Sections
and a 7-person External Advisory Committee to guide program priorities and external assessment; and 7)
Program evaluation to ensure alignment with the needs of trainees, mentees, and institutional strengths. The
evolution of the CAPACiTy post-doctoral training program will train the next generation of cancer control
researchers with an explicit focus on reducing the evidence-to-practice gap in cancer control through
translational science."

The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium (PIDTC) was founded in 2009 to bring together
immunologists, bone marrow transplant (BMT) physicians, and cell/gene therapists to improve treatments and
outcomes for patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI). The PIDTC has aggregated data from 49 sites across
the US and Canada to address key questions related to the treatment and outcomes of the most severe, life-
threatening IEIs including Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID), Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD),
Wiskott- Aldrich Syndrome (WAS), and Primary Immune Regulatory Disorders (PIRD). The PIDTC database, along
with the associated tools that have been built to facilitate acquisition of detailed longitudinal data across a diverse
network of clinical sites, and the aggregate experience of the involved clinical and scientific experts, has become
an indispensable resource for research, treatment planning, and clinical care advancement within the IEI
community. We propose that the data, materials, and expertise of PIDTC now be organized and made available as
a resource to the entire IEI community with key enhancements that will empower the community to easily access
and use the PIDTC Resource, and simultaneously ensure the continued growth and sustainment of the PIDTC
Resource. We will expand the PIDTC Resource to increase its utility and improve the power to answer further
questions related to the treatment of IEI's including particular genotypes or clinical subtypes of disease. We will
consolidate and build tools and infrastructure to accelerate standardized data collection from ongoing and future
studies and trials that are contributing data to the PIDTC Resource. We will provide tools to make the PIDTC data
more readily accessible to the broader IEI community including researchers, clinical care providers, patient
advocacy groups, patients, foundations, and consortia. This expansion and transformation of the PIDTC into an
open resource will enable diverse users to take advantage of unparalleled IEI datasets to increase understanding
and develop better health outcomes for patients as well as conduct new studies with the support of the PIDTC
Resource database, expertise and infrastructure. Together, we will further propel the PIDTC's mission to study
therapeutic outcomes in IEI and improve the outcomes of patients with IEI."

This is a fourth competitive renewal of our highly successful Biodefense Training Program (BTP) for predoctoral
students; first funded in 2004, prior to the building of the Galveston National Laboratory (GNL) in 2008. Since
then, there has been an explosive growth of research at UTMB on biodefense-related and other emerging/re-
emerging microbes of significant public health concern, the latest being SARS-CoV2. The goal of this grant
remains to train a new generation of scientists for diverse research careers (in academia, pharma, or in regulatory
agencies) critical to protecting the world from bioweapons and from epidemics/pandemics caused by naturally
emerging, highly pathogenic bacteria and viruses. With significant advances in biotechnology, the development
of artificially engineered microbes that have the potential to spread more quickly, are more lethal, and resist
prevention or treatment options is a reality. Therefore, concerted efforts by the federal government to train next
generation scientists capable of safely working at BSL-3 and BSL-4 containment at both academic campuses
and government facilities remain critical. UTMB is well qualified to train these scientists by virtue of the existence
of the GNL, which has comprehensive maximum containment and excellent core facilities, successful and well-
funded major biodefense research programs, and a highly developed biocontainment training program. UTMB
faculty have developed countermeasures already in use in patients or are in various stages of development. The
strong and diverse biodefense and emerging infectious disease research portfolio ranges from vaccine
development to diagnostics, antimicrobial development to pathogenesis, and these programs are highly
collaborative and interdisciplinary in nature. The BTP supports four PhD or MD/PhD students each year enrolled
in one of four graduate programs: MICR, PATH, BCMB, and HPTM. Trainees are selected for up to 2 years by
an Executive Committee after they have completed their qualifying exam and have submitted a formal F31-style
proposal which is evaluated first by a standing review committee and ranked. In addition to courses required by
the respective graduate programs, BTP trainees enroll in elective classes specific to biodefense/emerging
infections/vaccinology track and custom-designed to meet their needs, with a special focus on responsible
conduct of research. With a structured mentoring plan, well-funded faculty participate in the program, but an
opportunity is provided to develop junior mentors through involvement of senior faculty as co-mentors in student
supervision. Enrichment activities include retreats organized by the trainees to discuss career opportunities with
invited past BTP trainees from academia, government, and industry, as well as to discuss topics in ethics and
specific research themes. Trainees also organize a Biodefense/Immunology Journal Club, and there is close
interaction of the students with seminar speakers during the weekly Infectious Diseases and Immunity
Colloquium. A strong, multi-component program for recruiting URM trainees exists and will be further augmented
to develop a biodefense/emerging infectious disease workforce mirroring the national population."

With the increasing complexity of cancer care, the rising numbers of diverse cancer survivors in the US
population, and the increasing global burden of cancer, it is critical that Pritzker School of Medicine (PSOM),
one of the most diverse and research-intensive medical schools, prepare a workforce trained to meet these
challenges. While the workforce for the continuum of cancer care is interdisciplinary and inter-professional, to
date, medical education has remained compartmentalized. In our first funding period, we have transformed our
approach to training medical students at PSOM for 21st Century cancer care via the Scholars in Oncology
Associated Research (SOAR) program. In a highly innovative 10-week intensive summer program for
medical students, SOAR successfully enrolled 63 participants (51 NCI funded, 12 PSOM funded in COVID 2020).
Of these, 29% are underrepresented in medicine and 20% did global work. In years when travel resumed, 33%
have been global. The SOAR program successfully inspired nearly 70% of participants to continue their cancer
research, leading to 52 cancer-related conference presentations and 37 cancer-related publications.
SOAR participants had higher research self-efficacy and intent to enter a research career than nonSOAR
peers and a deepening of their commitment to cancer research. We propose to continue SOAR to enroll
12 medical students each year, including 4 who will conduct global cancer research at UChicago Global partner
sites. Each student will conduct interdisciplinary cutting-edge cancer research with strong mentorship by
established NIH funded investigators in our Comprehensive Cancer Center or the Center for Global
Health. In addition, trainees will take part in formal instruction in responsible conduct of research, didactic
lectures on the science of oncology, interdisciplinary tumor boards, research skill development and career
planning activities as well as opportunities for career exploration, networking, and outreach that will increase
their knowledge of cancer and motivate them to pursue further education and training for future careers as cancer
researchers. Trainees will be supported by a tiered mentorship structure that includes Faculty Track Group
Leaders who will be responsible for monitoring progress along milestones of completing their projects and lead
peer mentoring sessions where they learn about each other’s research. Using didactic sessions, experiential
research training in settings that represent the diversity of cancer research, and exposure to national and global
leaders in oncology research across the care continuum, SOAR participants will have a greater appreciation for
the interdisciplinary and interprofessional nature of oncology care and research. With rigorous evaluation and
planning, we will continue to build on our success with SOAR and determine if SOAR participants show a greater
propensity to enter cancer research/oncology careers, while tracking outcomes such as publications, grants, and
entry into academic careers. SOAR will enable PSOM to maintain its tradition of excellence in preparing a diverse
and highly skilled workforce to achieve the promise of precision oncology care and promote global health equity."

10937173,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Malignant melanoma is known to be the most aggressive and deadliest
form of skin cancer. Prognosis is poor in the advanced metastatic stage with less than 10% rate of survival.
Thus, new therapeutic approaches are needed for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Tubulin inhibitors such
as paclitaxel, docetaxel, or nab-paclitaxel are widely used to treat cancers either as single agents or in
combination. However, their clinical efficacy is often limited by the development of multidrug resistance, dose
limiting hematopoietic toxicity, and cumulative neurotoxicity. Working to overcome these limitations, we have
recently discovered a new scaffold of tubulin inhibitors, fused heterocyclic pyrimidine (FHP), that are highly
potent against both taxane sensitive and resistant melanoma cell lines in vitro as well as in vivo. High-resolution
X-ray crystal structures confirmed that FHPs directly bind at the colchicine site (CBS) in tubulin to destabilize
microtubule networks, thereby enabling efficient molecular modeling guided structural optimization based on the
existing co-crystal structures. According to our preliminary studies, our central hypothesis is that the novel FHP
scaffolds can be further optimized to form the basis for the development of a new generation of tubulin inhibitors
targeting the tubulin CBS for the treatment of multidrug resistant metastatic melanoma. Our objective in this
application is to use molecular modeling guided synthetic chemistry based on the existing co-crystal structures
and cancer biology to optimize the FHP scaffold for enhanced therapeutic potential. The objectives of this
application will be accomplished by three specific aims: (1) Develop quinoxaline-based FHPs through rational
lead optimization, cell line screening, and mode of action studies. Quinoxaline-based FHPs represent a novel
approach to optimizing FHP-based inhibitors. Our preliminary data shows that quinoxaline-based FHPs potently
inhibit proliferation of human A375 melanoma cells. The working hypothesis is that the modifications will improve
their binding with tubulin, improve metabolic stability, improve water solubility, and reduce potential toxicity. Also,
comprehensive screening against diverse sensitive and resistant cell lines will give feedback to the iterative lead
optimization. We hypothesize that quinoxaline-based FHP analogues will maintain their (a) mode of action, (b)
efficacy against diverse multi drug resistant cancer cell lines, (c) ability to dose dependently inhibit colony
formation, and (d) ability to dose dependently introduce vascular disruption. (2) Develop imidazopyrazine-based
FHPs through rational lead optimization, cell line screening, and mode of action studies. Our preliminary data
shows that imidazopyrazine-based FHPs potently inhibit cancer cell proliferation, inhibit tubulin polymerization,
and introduce mitotic arrest. To develop this new series of CBSIs we will perform similar analyses as in Aim 1,
to include (A) molecular modeling guided iterative lead optimization, (B) screening against multiple normal and
resistant cancer cell lines, and (C) mode of action studies. Our working hypothesis is that these modifications
will lead to new imidazopyrazine-based FHPs with enhanced efficacy and improved therapeutic utilities. (3) we
will determine MTD, and in vivo efficacy as well as toxicity for selected new FHPs. The working hypothesis is
that the new FPH analogues will maintain strong in vivo efficacy with significantly improved therapeutic utilities.
This study is innovative because (1) FHP platform represents a validated scaffold that interacts with the CBS of
tubulin, (2) FHP scaffold can effectively overcome taxane resistance which is clinically innovative, and (3) FHP
scaffold has better drug like properties and lower toxicities than CBS inhibitors that are in clinical trial."
10920637,"Developing a novel epigenetic regulator as a treatment for cocaine use disorder
Project Summary/Abstract
 Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a major public health problem that is associated with substantial morbidity
and mortality. Treatment for CUD primarily consists of behavioral interventions including contingency
management, cognitive behavioral therapy, or therapeutic communities. However, these approaches result in a
substantial relapse rate in those seeking treatment, and despite efforts to develop pharmacological agents, no
medications have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of CUD. One reason that people with CUD
have difficult quitting and remaining abstinent is the intense drug-related contextual memory that links drug use
to euphoria-like feelings. We have recently identified a novel mechanism of that promotes neuronal plasticity and
memory consolidation/reconsolidation via ACSS2, a metabolic enzyme that regulates histone acetylation and
Immediate Early gene expression involved in memory formation and retrieval. We hypothesize that small
molecule inhibitors of ACSS2 will selectively disrupt drug and cue-related memory reconsolidation, leading to
diminished drug craving, thereby enabling preventing relapse in people with CUD. Using a commercially
available ACSS2i (ADG-205), we have demonstrated that acute inhibition of ACSS2 can decrease relapse
behavior in several pre-clinical models of substance abuse, including nicotine, alcohol, opioid and cocaine. While
ADG-205 has proven efficacious, we cannot patent the molecule and we have observed some less than ideal
pharmacological properties. Through medicinal chemistry efforts, we generated 55 new compounds. One
compound in particular, EPV, exhibits a novel scaffold, with improved efficacy and brain bioavailability.
 The aim of this application is to establish EPV as a viable new generation of ACSS2 inhibitor through 2
ams. Aim 1 will assess pharmacological parameters such as selectivity, functional efficacy on histone acetylation
and gene regulation, ADME properties and basic pharmacokinetics. Aim 2 will focus on testing our novel scaffold
in a pre-clinical model of cocaine use called intravenous self-administration. Additionally, we will confirm that
EPV treatment does not affect learning and non-targeted memories.
 These studies will yield a novel lead candidate molecule with improved pharmacological properties, which
will lead to a new program of medicinal chemistry to develop new drug candidates. Overall, our program
proposes an entirely new mechanism of action for treating cocaine addiction. Significant strengths of the
application include the novelty of the proposed target, required in vitro and in vivo assays already in place, and
a novel chemical scaffold to initiate drug development."
10920863,"Project Summary
Cūrza is developing a new class of broad-spectrum antibiotics, focused on multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-
negative pathogens. The CZ-02 program is directed towards compounds that bind to a unique site on the
bacterial ribosome that is not targeted by approved antibiotics and have not encountered cross-resistance to
other antibiotics used clinically. Inspired by a natural product identified as a lead for Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb), analogs have been developed that selectively inhibit bacterial protein synthesis, with little effect on
mammalian protein synthesis, through a binding interaction with the ribosome at a heretofore un-drugged site.
The natural product that inspired CZ-02s has multiple metabolic liabilities and lacks activity against Gram-
negative pathogens. However, after re-engineering the natural product’s minimum pharmacophore responsible
for activity into new chemical matter the resulting compounds are metabolically stable, exhibit exquisite selectivity
and potency for bacterial protein synthesis and are efficacious against MDR pathogens in vitro and in vivo; all
while displaying a lack of cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells and sparing mitochondrial function. The proposed
SBIR project will ultimately deliver a new antibiotic candidate that is potent with broad spectrum activity and
efficacy, focusing on Gram-negative pathogens that will be at the GLP toxicology stage.
This Direct Phase II project will advance the CZ-02 program by the following aims. Aim 1 will optimize the lead
series to improve activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii while maintaining
coverage of Enterobacterales and Gram-positive pathogens. Rigorous microbiological and biochemical
evaluation along with profiling of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox) will
guide optimization efforts. Aim 2 will use in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation to guide optimization along with
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) determination to guide in vivo efficacy initially in mouse septicemia models to
select lead compounds for evaluation in pneumonia models of P. aeruginosa and/or A. baumannii for down-
selection to a single lead candidate. Aim 3 will provide scale-up chemistry to support in vivo studies. Aim 4 has
sophisticated PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiling to establish the PD driver of efficacy and definition of the
optimal dosing regimen in pneumonia models.
At the culmination of the project, a lead compound will be ready for non-GLP toxicology and subsequent IND-
enabling studies to ultimately deliver a new antibiotic from a novel class targeting Gram-negative pathogens."

necessary for Dr. Wise to transition to an independent investigator and enable her to build and sustain a
program of research developing, implementing, and testing behavioral interventions to reduce cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk among women living with HIV (WLHIV). Completion of the proposed research and training
aims will enable Dr. Wise to gain the critical skillsets necessary to transition to independence and generate the
data necessary to support an R01 at the end of this award period. CVD is the number one cause of morbidity
and mortality among women in the United States (US). WLHIV have 2-4-fold higher risk for CVD compared to
women without HIV-infection. HIV and CVD disparities are particularly prevalent among women in the
Southern US. While increased prevalence of traditional risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and obesity)
partially explain this risk, evidence suggests that increased exposure to adverse structural and social stressors
(i.e., poverty, discrimination, and stigma) among WLHIV in the South negatively contribute to CVD disparities
through their impact on stress. Stress is an established risk factor for CVD. WLHIV have 4-5x increased risk for
stress and stress-related disorders compared to the general population. While exposure to structural and social
stressors is difficult to change, behavioral interventions to reduce an individual’s stress response are
effective in reducing stress and may mitigate CVD risk. The Stress Management and Resiliency Training
(SMART) Intervention is an evidence based behavioral intervention offered as an integral part of
Massachusetts General Hospital’s Intensive Cardiac Rehabilitation program. The SMART intervention is
proven to reduce physiologic responses to stress. The intervention works to decrease stress responses and
CVD risk by improving resiliency to environmental stressors and decreasing sympathetic nervous system
activation. While the SMART intervention has demonstrated efficacy in a wide range of populations and
settings, it has not been designed or tested among WLHIV in the South, where unique cultural and faith-based
context may diminish the uptake and value of the intervention to mitigate CVD risk. To that end, the
overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the critical skillsets necessary to build a program of research
focused on developing, testing, and implementing behavioral interventions to reduce CVD risk. With the help of
my mentors, I will develop critical skillsets in 1) stress and CVD and interventions to reduce risk, 2) the
adaptation of interventions to maximize feasibility, acceptability, and impact, and the 3) design and conduct of
behavioral-implementation trials as we systematically adapt, implement, and pilot test the SMART
intervention for WLHIV in the Southern US. Data generated on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
impact of the adapted intervention to reduce stress and mitigate CVD risk will directly support the development
of an R01 application to test the efficacy of the adapted SMART intervention at the end of this award period."
10921200,"Treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa infection remains a challenge at the clinic due
to suboptimal responses to existing antibiotics. Around 42% of the 64,000 HAP cases with P.
aeruginosa infection lead to death in the US annually. MDR P. aeruginosa is often associated
with overexpression of multiple efflux pumps that limit the exposure of several classes of
antibiotics rendering them ineffective. As a counterstrategy, TAXIS Pharmaceuticals is committed
to finding effective anti-pseudomonal therapy involving novel efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) as
adjunctive with levofloxacin, to enhance its exposure in Gram-negative pathogens by blocking
their efflux capabilities. During the hit-to-lead campaign of this program, our structure-activity
relationship (SAR) efforts have successfully identified a 7-membered dihydrobenzo
azepinoindolone compound (TXA14007) as the lead EPI with favorable ADME and
physiochemical properties. TXA14007 shows remarkable potentiation of levofloxacin against
MDR strains from CDC and WRAIR-MRSN collections as well as other MDR clinical isolates of
P. aeruginosa retrieved from 63 countries and 3 US hospitals. Mechanistic studies indicate that
TXA14007 specifically inhibits efflux pump activities, without affecting bacterial membrane
integrity. Previous clinical development of EPIs has stalled or stopped due to either toxicity
concerns or limited evidence for in vivo efficacy. In contrast, TAXIS’ TXA14007 has demonstrated
durable, validated in vivo efficacy in murine lung infection model with wild-type P. aeruginosa in
combination with levofloxacin. Moreover, TXA14007 has so far circumvented the major
toxicological issues that plagued previous developmental EPIs, showing a relatively safer
toxicology profile when screened for cytotoxicity, hemolytic activity, off-target receptor binding,
hERG channel inhibition, in vitro nephrotoxicity, and acute toxicity. Further, a close analog of
TXA14007 displays a complementary pharmacokinetic profile with levofloxacin in plasma and
BALF samples of infected mice, thus ensuring maximum pharmacodynamic benefits. The goal of
this SBIR phase II application is to optimize TXA14007 with a multiparametric SAR study to further
improve its efficacy in terms of combination synergy and PK parameters, as well as further
advancing our investigation into its (and analogs’) in vivo nephrotoxicity and cardiotoxicity profile.
If successful, our phase II efforts will lead up to a preclinical candidate with a real chance to reach
the clinic and save lives."
10927358,"Mitakuye Oyasin is a well-known Lakota phrase that means “we are all related.” This phrase is often used to
signify the Lakota people’s appreciation for and relationship with the environment (Unci Maka, or Grandmother
Earth). This Native American Research Centers for Health (NARCH) XII program application, entitled Lakota
Center for Health Research, describes a body of activities that are designed to exemplify this concept in both
practical and innovative ways. Lakota Center for Health Research serves to broaden and deepen our
examination of health inequities experienced by our three Lakota Tribal partners and the Rapid City Indian
community. To strengthen these relations between the Lakota Tribal partners, other NARCH research partners,
and the Black Hills Center for American Indian Health, to conduct the following administrative activities during
the funding period of the proposed project:
 1. Facilitate quarterly meetings of the Coordinating Committee whose members compromise of three tribal
 representatives (one from each tribal partner), Dr. Jeffrey Henderson (PI), and one Lakota youth
representative.
 2. Facilitate quarterly meetings of the Community and Scientific Advisory Council (CSAC), whose members
 compromise of three tribal members each from the three Lakota tribal partners and three scientists (Drs.
 Jeffrey Henderson, Patricia Nez Henderson, and Samantha Sabo).
 3. Develop and implement a comprehensive evaluation for the NARCH program."

Indigenous women experience gender-based violence (GBV) at disproportionately high rates, contributing to
devastating impacts to health and wellbeing including substance misuse and mental health disorders. Our
understanding of the complex, intersecting health needs of Indigenous women who experience co-occurring
substance misuse, mental health,and GBV on reservation-based and urban areas in the Midwest is limited.
Additionally, the services available toaddress these issues are siloed and ineffective in meeting the needs of
Indigenous women. To address this urgent gap, we propose a pilot study that uses a mixed-methods and
community engaged approach to identify and understand barriers to help-seeking among Indigenous women
with co-occurring mental health and/or substance use disorders after experiences of gender-based violence, and
to understand how resiliency and cultural identity may help to motivate help-seeking among Indigenous women
survivors of GBV in the localcontext of Wisconsin. This proposed pilot study is the first of its kind in Wisconsin
by being Indigenous led, andthrough the formation of academic community partnerships between universities, 3
of Wisconsin’s 11 federally recognized tribes, Indigenous-led organizations, and tribal community leaders across
the State. First, a community advisory team comprised of GBV survivors, providers, elders, and other
stakeholders will be assembled and meet to ensure that all aspects of the study are culturally safe and meets
the needs of the collaborating communities. We will conduct a survey and individual interviews with 90-100
Indigenous women to better understand their experiences, barriers to help-seeking, and resiliency factors that
motivate help-seeking after experiences with GBV. Women will be recruited from community-based partner
agencies, tribal health clinics, Indigenous led organizations, and tribal community leaders in order to capture
women seeking help as well as women who have not sought help. Our proposed community engaged study is
in line with the priorities of the Native American Research Center for Health (NARCH) initiative because it aims
to address the health disparities related to GBV while promoting wellness in Indigenous populations by allowing
communities to select, control and prioritize health-related research and research career enhancement
opportunities, and establishes trust between academic institutions and tribal communities. Our pilot study data
will generate baseline data andknowledge to advance our understanding of the complex needs of Indigenous
women after experiences of GBV and reduce barriers to needed services and allow for the meaningful
dissemination of findings in a way that reduces health disparities and promotes health equity. This pilot study
proposal also helps to build a foundationupon which to carry out larger community based participatory studies
that can be used to generate actionable recommendations to improve identification and comprehensive
treatment of substance misuse, GBV, and otherhealthcare and safety concerns among Indigenous women."
10932039,"Project Abstract
Methamphetamine is a highly addictive central nervous system (CNS) psychostimulant that causes long-term
damage to regions of the brain that regulate cognitive and psychiatric functions and promote drug-seeking
behavior and consequently, makes recovery from methamphetamine extremely difficult. The current standard of
care for stimulant use disorder (amphetamine-type, methamphetamine) is behavioral therapies but,
unfortunately, the majority of patients relapse to methamphetamine use within one year after treatment. There
are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics for methamphetamine addiction. Emerging evidence demonstrates
how immune factors can influence addictive behaviors and contribute to substance use disorders. We have a
collection of MHC class II constructs that bind to and downregulate the expression of CD74—the primary receptor
for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a key inflammatory indicator in stimulant use disorder, as well
as other diseases. These constructs have therapeutic impact on drug-seeking behavior, and can also impact
cognitive function, and inflammation-associated with exposure to methamphetamine, suggesting a therapeutic
profile better than previously developed targets. The primary objective of this proposal is to evaluate our current
generation molecule, DRhQ, in preclinical animal models of stimulant use disorder. Within the drug development
process, DRhQ is moving from the lead optimization stage into the preclinical development stage. DRhQ, in its
final monomeric formulation, will be evaluated in this proposal demonstrating the feasibility of the molecule to be
used in clinical testing. Two animal models will be utilized to confirm cross-species efficacy. In rats, the impact
of DRhQ on cue-induced reinstatement following an extended access model will be evaluated. In mice, we will
use an established colony of Cd74 knockout and C57BL/6J control mice to evaluate the effects of DRhQ on
methamphetamine intake and preference (2-bottle choice test). We hypothesize that the effects of DRhQ
treatment in C57BL/6 mice will be similar to the effect of the Cd74 knockout on methamphetamine use,
confirming the mechanism of action for DRhQ. Key brain regions and plasma will be evaluated to identify
changes in protein expression following methamphetamine exposure and DRhQ immunotherapy. Collectively,
this research will help identify a biomarker for assessing DRhQ treatment response in patients with stimulant use
disorder or recovering from methamphetamine use. We expect that following the completion of this one-year
project, we will have definitive evidence that provides a strong rationale to advance the drug into clinical testing
as a treatment for stimulant use disorder."
10937808,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Meiotic recombination is a fundamental aspect of reproduction in most eukaryotes. Recombination rate, i.e. the
number of crossovers per generation, is also a key modulator of genetic and evolutionary processes, having
profound effects on basic patterns of genetic inheritance, as well as high-level phenomena like adaptation and
speciation. Errors in recombination (e.g., nondisjunction) also contribute to a variety of human chromosomal
disorders, including trisomy 21 and Klinefelter syndrome. Despite its wide-ranging importance across many
domains of biology, we have a poor understanding of how and why recombination rate varies across biological
scales. Over the next five years, my lab will shed light on the genetic and evolutionary causes and
consequences of recombination rate variation by testing long-standing hypotheses using modern
genomic tools. This work will leverage empirical tools from two model systems, threespine sticklebacks and
Drosophila, and several new key genomic technologies. We will undertake four lines of research to test
hypotheses regarding the evolutionary drivers of recombination rate variation in natural populations. First, we
will explore the evolutionary drivers of recombination rate variation in a model vertebrate, threespine
sticklebacks, using gamete sequencing. Second, we will perform the first experimental test for the role of
structural variants in determining genome-wide recombination rate variation in vertebrates. Third, we will
perform a novel experimental test of the role of chromosomal inversions in adaptation using recent
advancements in CRISPR-mediated chromosomal engineering to create and “undo” chromosomal
arrangements in a Drosophila model species. Finally, we will develop modern and user-friendly statistical
methods for comparing recombination maps within and between species and populations. This research
program will greatly advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of meiotic recombination, create
myriad new resources and tools, and train personnel in cutting-edge techniques that span genomics,
computational biology, and evolutionary biology. These advances will be applicable across all domains of
biology, from understanding the evolution of diseases like SARS-CoV-2, to understanding the fundamental
mechanics of evolution in natural populations."
10937397,"PROJECT SUMMARY: RNA therapeutics are experiencing a renaissance with the clinical successes of the
COVID-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. In parallel, nanomaterials have emerged as highly promising
vehicles for RNA delivery. However, despite considerable scientific advances in nanoparticle therapeutics over
the last several decades, few nanoparticle-based RNA therapeutics have been clinically approved. As the RNA
therapeutics landscape expands, there remain key understanding gaps that must be addressed to inform the
rational design of RNA therapeutic systems across molecular, cellular, and organismal levels and enable
broad clinical translation: (1) how RNA cargo parameters, carrier properties, and their combinations govern
functional in vivo RNA delivery; (2) how the biological environment of the host alters RNA nanocarriers and their
in vivo functionalities; and (3) in turn, how RNA therapeutic systems modify the host. Further exacerbating these
knowledge gaps is a lack of high-sensitivity, high-throughput tools for interrogation of functional in vivo RNA
delivery, nanoparticle-biomolecule interactions, and the host response. The proposed program will adopt multi-
pronged strategies to address these challenges, by integrating our complementary expertise in ultrasensitive
biomolecule detection, RNA engineering, and nanoparticle drug delivery. Using mRNA as a representative RNA
drug, we seek to elucidate design rules for both RNA nanocarrier and cargo for functional RNA delivery.
Leveraging our technology for multiplexed single-molecule detection of low abundance biomolecules, we will
pursue orthogonal focus areas: (1) develop and apply an ultrasensitive screening platform for pooled in vivo
analysis of mRNA therapeutic systems, to identify RNA cargo and carrier determinants of functional mRNA
delivery; (2) understand and predict the host response to RNA therapeutic systems via high-multiplex single-
molecule protein detection; and (3) probe the biomolecular interactions of nanocarriers and their effects on in
vivo functionality via high-throughput, high-resolution profiling of biomolecule adsorption. These three
independent yet synergistic directions align well with NIGMS mission objectives in the application of innovative
physical methodologies and quantitative approaches to establish foundations for disease treatment. If successful,
this program will build an integrated understanding of RNA therapeutic system design rules and host factors that
govern RNA delivery and individual response. The ultrasensitive profiling tools developed in this work will be of
broad utility across diverse RNA therapeutic systems and disease applications."
10912490,"The eye is 10 times more susceptible to exposure to vesicants than other organs. The aftermath of these
exposures and their impacts on human vision are easy to underestimate since many ocular symptoms may
manifest long after exposure. Thus, it has been documented that the survivors of a vesicant attack during the
Iraq–Iran War not only experienced corneal damage in the first 30 h after the attack but also manifested
diminished scotopic and photopic electroretinogram responses 40 years later. In addition, delayed symptoms in
these individuals also included central retinal vein occlusion and an increase of soluble VEGF-A in their tears.
Currently, there is no effective antidote to combat vesicant-induced ocular damage and vision loss in humans.
Therefore, our long-term goal is to generate effective medical countermeasures to mitigate the consequences of
such exposures. This goal will not be achievable unless we increase our molecular understanding of the
underlying mechanism responsible for the ocular damage and progressive ocular injuries caused by vesicant
exposure. Therefore, in this proposal, we analyze direct ocular exposure (DOE) to vesicants to identify the
molecular signaling driving the acute and chronic stages of corneal, vascular, and retinal pathobiology. Focusing
on the unfolded protein response (UPR)-TRIB3 downstream signaling, we hypothesize that, upon DOE, not only
the corneal tissue but also other ocular tissues, such as vascular and retinal tissues, are damaged, and
depending on the severity, vesicant exposure activates UPR-TRIB3 signaling in the cornea, which further
propagates the VEGF signal, causing blood vessel dysfunction and retinal injury. To dissect the mechanistic link
between direct ocular exposure and pathophysiology, we propose a diverse spectrum of step-by-step strategies
and a broad arsenal of tools. These tools include different animal models (mice and tree shrews), corneal and
retinal ex vivo tissue, corneal and retinal cultured cells, two different toxicants (lewisite and nitrogen mustard),
and genetic ablation of TRIB3 in the corneal, vascular, and retinal tissue to block the TRIB3-VEGF signal and
delay the onset of ocular injuries. The latter will be confirmed in experiments with vesicant-exposed animals
treated with a small-molecule inhibitor VEGF-Trap-Eye. Therefore, in Aim #1, we propose to investigate whether
DOE to vesicants activates the UPR-TRIB3-VEGF axis, acting as a molecular driver of corneal tissue injury. We
will demonstrate the molecular consequences of corneal-originated TRIB3-VEGF axis activation. In Aim #2, we
intend to determine whether secreted corneal TRIB3-mediated VEGF signal drives vascular pathogenesis by
assessing corneal neovascularization (NV) and retinal blood vessel disruption. In Aim #3, we plan to investigate
whether secreted cornea- and vascular-mediated VEGF drives the pathophysiology of retinal injury through the
activation of UPR-TRIB3. These studies will identify a novel and highly interesting molecular mechanism by
which the activated UPR-TRIB3-VEGF axis acts as a molecular driver of ocular tissue pathobiology and will
establish a groundwork for future mechanistic studies of ocular toxicity in exposed populations."

 30-50% of persons living with HIV still suffer from neurological co-morbidities, including HIV-associated
Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND) and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite the success of combined
Antiretroviral Therapy (cART). Persistent macrophage and microglia driven neuroinflammation is seen as a
common underlying factor in HAND and PTSD disease progression. The long-term objective of this research is
to understand the underling mechanisms that influence neuroinflammatory processes in neurological disorders
to target more specific endogenous signaling mechanisms for development of novel therapeutic approaches. In
this study we will explore estrogen signaling in macrophages and microglia as a possible therapeutic target. 17β-
estradiol, the most active form of estrogen, is reduced in postmenopausal women. Studies have shown that 17β-
estradiol is neuroprotective and its reduced expression may correlate with worse HIV and PTSD disease
progression. However, how changes in estrogen concentrations and its receptors may modulate HIV-induced
neurocognitive impairment in the post-menopausal women living with PTSD is unknown. Therefore, we
hypothesize that macrophage and microglia induced neuroinflammation will be suppressed by estrogen,
in an GPER dependent manner, in the aging female compared to males and pre-menopausal females
living with Post-traumatic stress disorder and HIV. To address this hypothesis, we will utilize 2 in vitro HIV
neuroinflammatory models: 1. A co-culture system composed of rat cortical neurons and human monocytes
derived macrophages isolated from PTSD donors and 2. A co-culture system of iMicroglia and iNeurons derived
from human pluripotent stem cells from healthy donors. iMicroglia and macrophages from pre and
postmenopausal women and aged matched men will be pretreated with various concentrations of estrogen prior
to HIVADA exposure to explore the following Specific Aims: 1) Evaluate estrogen’s ability to suppress HIV-
induced neuroinflammation in PTSD-hMDM and Microglia. 2) Evaluate the role of estrogen receptors in
HIV and PTSD-induced neuroinflammation. In this proposed award, we expect hMDMs from post-menopausal
female PTSD donors and iMicroglia will have increased HIV-induced neuroinflammation, which can be
suppressed by GPER activation. The principal investigator’s career goals are to lead an independent translation
research program while increasing diversity in the sciences at a Historically Black College and University
(HBCU). To accomplish this, the PI has developed a strong training plan that will expand her expertise in the
NeuroAIDS and PTSD field, increase her skillset in the generation of iPSC, flow cytometry, mass cytometry,
biostatistical analysis and generate data for future R awards. This training will be guided by the strong mentoring
committee of investigators from Spelman College and neighboring Research 1 institutions. With success of this
project, we will elucidate the role of estrogen signaling as a potential endogenous targeted therapeutic avenue
for persons living with HAND, PTSD and other neuroinflammatory disorders."

An R25 PREP Grant would provide the core funding for a new postbaccalaureate program at UCSF. This
program will build on our highly successful pilot program, PROPEL, which will end this year. The goal of the
PREP program will be to provide trainees from historically underrepresented backgrounds with the research
experience and enhanced scientific training needed to be competitive for top-tier biomedical science PhD and
MD/PhD programs. To achieve this goal, we have developed a research education plan that includes defined
Aims and measurable outcomes. Aim 1 is to provide PREP scholars with the opportunity to obtain
substantive experience conducting rigorous biomedical research in a full-time mentored research
position. A substantive experience conducting original research in a laboratory is one of the strongest predictors
of success in graduate school. However, research internships are few and far between at many universities, and
we find that insufficient research experience is one of the most common reasons why trainees from historically
underrepresented groups are not competitive for our graduate programs. Aim 1 addresses this gap in experience
by placing trainees into UCSF labs, where they obtain first-hand experience conducting discovery-based
research in a supportive, mentored environment. Progress on their research as well as toward their scientific
and career development goals are defined in a Mentoring Plan and monitored by their research mentor and in
biannual committee meetings. Aim 2 is to promote the development of scientific knowledge and
communication skills. A broad foundation of knowledge about modern biomedical science is important to
prepare scholars for graduate level research in this multidisciplinary era, and to help them make informed
decisions about what type of PhD program they want to go into. To develop this knowledge, PREP scholars
attend lectures, and participate in educational activities such as a literature review workshop and biostatistics
and programming classes. The scholars’ scientific development is assessed by the instructors, and the program
content is evaluated and updated regularly. Aim 3 is to promote career development skills and a sense of
community that reinforce scientific identity. A major barrier for many applicants to graduate school is a lack
of sufficient experience with professional work environments as well as a lack of knowledge about the specific
expectations of a graduate program in the biological sciences. To address this need, our scholars complete a
series of workshops, mentored activities, and self-directed exercises that help to develop this crucial knowledge
and professional skill set. The scholar’s career development is monitored through regular meetings with their
mentors and with structured evaluations, and tangible products from these activities, such as an individual
development plan and draft personal statement. These are used to reinforce the scholars’ scientific identity and
prepare graduate school applications. Collectively, we expect that the experiences in the PREP Program will
make our scholars more competitive for graduate school and will substantially advance their careers."
10913561,"Project summary
Social memory impairment is one of the most debilitating symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although
the hippocampus has been well established to be the key player in social memory, hippocampal input regions
that may regulate social memory have not been explored. The septum sends strong direct and indirect
projections to the hippocampus and has been heavily implicated in emotional processing and social interactions.
However, it is unclear which synaptic changes and cell-types drive the septum’s role in social memory. Further,
the impact of the septum in social memory-related disorders such as ASD is understudied. Therefore,
investigating the mechanism of social memory and the associated synaptic and cellular changes will be critical
for creating additional and potentially improved treatment options.
My long-term goal is to use integrative approaches to study the mechanisms of social dysfunction. The overall
objective is to identify circuit and synaptic underpinnings of social memory regulation by the septum and develop
rescue strategies for social memory deficits in mouse models with social memory impairments. Based on my
preliminary results, I hypothesize that synaptic plasticity in certain septal cell-types occurs after social exposure
and that these synaptic changes are likely to be the critical factor in enhancing social memory. Therefore, I will
pursue two specific aims: 1) Dissect the circuit and synaptic mechanisms of social memory modulation by the
septum; and 2) Develop rescue strategies for social memory deficits in ASD-associated mouse models with
social memory impairment. In the first aim I will systematically identify the septal cell-types involved in social
memory using a combination of viral tracing and immunohistochemistry. I will then determine social memory-
induced input changes from septal neurons onto hippocampal neurons with ex vivo slice electrophysiology in
FosTRAP2 mice. Finally, I will determine the septum’s role in social memory acquisition, consolidation and recall
via in vivo optogenetics. In the second aim, I plan to identify the synaptic alterations in two ASD-associated
mouse models, Neuroligin-3R451C and SynGAP1het lines, which display social memory deficiency. Moreover, I will
develop strategies for the improvement of social memory in these mouse lines via in vivo optogenetic stimulation
and micro-infusion of neuromodulators.
The approach detailed in this proposal is innovative, because it harnesses new technological advances by
integrating viral-tracing with in vivo and ex vivo optogenetics to examine the mechanisms governing social
memory. Preliminary studies suggest that the septum to hippocampal projection plays a role in regulating social
memory and that the control of social memory by the septum is bi-directional. The proposed research is therefore
highly significant, as the bi-directional control of social memory offers immense therapeutic potential. Ultimately,
the outcome will likely provide a framework for translational research towards the improvement of social memory
deficits."
10913582,"Chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs) affect over 100 million people, predominantly women. Yet, they
remain ineffectively treated due, in large part, to lack of valid animal models with translational relevance. In
response to FOA PAR-18-763, this proposal seeks to develop a new mouse model of COPCs with improved
external validity to facilitate discovery of neurotherapeutics with analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Our
model will incorporate key genetic and environmental factors known to contribute to the etiology of COPCs
through enhancing catacholaminergic tone. An estimated 66% of patients with COPCs such as fibromyalgia
have functional variants in the gene encoding catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT; a ubiquitously expressed
enzyme that metabolizes catecholamines), that result in low COMT activity. The effect of COMT genotype on
pain is modified by stress and injury. For example, individuals with the ‘low activity’ COMT genotype report
enhanced pain following stressful events (eg, motor vehicle collision and psychological strain) and injurious
surgical procedures (eg, molar extraction and mastectomy). Low COMT, stress, and injury can produce pain by
increasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that sensitize nociceptors. Previously, our lab
employed a pharmacologic approach to study mechanisms and targets driving COMT-dependent pain, yet this
approach does not adequately mimic the complex clinical etiology of COPCs. Thus, the objective of this
proposal is to develop and validate a novel mouse model of COPCS in which genetically predisposed
COMT+/- mice undergo stressful and injurious events. Our central hypothesis is that COMT+/- mice,
especially females, undergoing transient stressful and injurious events will develop chronic pain at multiple
body sites and increased levels of clinically-relevant cytokine biomarkers that will be reduced by existing FDA-
approved analgesics. Preliminary data show that COMT+/- mice, which exhibit normal baseline pain behavior,
undergoing swim stress and molar extraction surgery develop exaggerated long-lasting pain at multiple body
sites (hindpaw, back, and abdomen). Further, COMT+/- mice undergoing swim stress and molar extraction
exhibit increased nociceptor activity. The studies proposed herein will extend this work. During the 1.5-year
R61 phase, we will establish the magnitude and duration of pain at several body sites, sensitization of primary
afferent nociceptors innervating those body sites, and pain-related depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors in
our COPC mouse model. Upon meeting the ‘go milestones’: COMT+/- vs WT mice undergoing stress+injury
exhibit significant increases (effect size >3) in 1) mechanical pain at multiple body sites and 2) nociceptor
activity, we will move to the R33 phase. During the 1.5-year R33 phase, we will evaluate clinically-relevant
cytokine biomarkers to determine construct validity and clinically-used analgesics to determine predictive
validity of our model. If successful, we will develop a novel mouse model of COPCS with improved validity that
will have a significant impact on effective discovery of analgesics with translational relevance."

10935406,"Abstract (Project 1)
The objective is to streamline the detection of incidental occult ovarian carcinoma and its precursor lesions in
fallopian tubes, which are the site of origin of “ovarian” high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). The updated
paradigm in the genesis of ovarian HGSC posits that tumor initiation occurs in the fallopian tube epithelium
through a precursor stage, serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). Women at high risk for ovarian cancer
are up to 20-35 times more likely to develop HGSC in their lifetime. The current recommendation for these
women is to undergo risk-reduction salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) after their childbearing age. This procedure
reduces but does not eliminate HGSC risk entirely because STIC or occult HGSC cells may have spread to the
peritoneum prior to surgery, portending a recurrence of an advanced stage disease. The current standard-of-
care diagnosis is based on examining surgically removed fallopian tubes. Since the lesions are grossly
inconspicuous, pathologists randomly section tubes and review only limited representative tissue sections,
precluding an accurate diagnosis and often failing to predict clinical outcome. Project 1 aims to apply Real-SeqS
and DREAMing in assessing STIC/HGSC specific aneuploidy patterns and methylation markers, respectively, to
sensitively diagnose STICs and incipient HGSC in RRSO specimens after brushing the surface of tubes and
ovaries to collect epithelial cells for Real-SeqS and DREAMing analyses. We propose the following two specific
aims. Aim 1. Assess the performance of Real-SeqS and DREAMing using tubal brushing specimens from
prospective RRSO specimens. Aim 2. Using several cutting-edge methods, assess the prioritized amplified
cancer genes including CCNE1 and RSF1 for their cancer-spreading phenotypes including proliferation, motility,
invasion, and tumor-forming ability in peritoneal tissues. This project springboards from several recent studies
published by current SPORE."
10935407,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY
Treatment of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) has been advanced by targeting specific genomic
alterations with DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitors. We found that combination PARP and ATR inhibition
(PARPi-ATRi) overcomes acquired PARPi resistance with a 50% overall response rate in BRCA-mutant HGSC
in the CAPRI investigator-initiated clinical trial (SPORE, Project 2, 2018-2023). We and others have now
discovered that CCNE1 amplification (CCNE1Amp) emerges with PARPi resistance using deep molecular profiling
of BRCA-mutant patient tumor samples. In addition, CCNE1Amp is a known subset of HGSC that are homologous
recombination proficient and resistant to both chemotherapy and PARPi, indicated that CCNE1AMP may
participate in acquired PARPi resistance. Overall, CCNE1Amp HGSC patients have poor overall survival and need
new therapeutic options.
The WEE1 kinase is a regulator of cell cycle progression and inhibition of this kinase causes aberrant DNA
synthesis, particularly in CCNE1Amp cells. Indeed, WEE1 inhibitors (WEE1i) have shown monotherapy activity in
CCNE1 overexpressing HGSC in the clinic. ZN-c3 is a next-generation WEE1i demonstrating significantly less
hematologic toxicity in Phase I trials than prior WEE1i, such as AZD1775. ZN-c3 is moving forward into a Phase
II clinical trial in CCNE1-overexpressing HGSC. We proposed to develop CCNE1 as a predictive biomarker of
WEE1i benefit as well as identify additional biomarkers that increase durable responses to treatment (Aims 1
and 3). Because emergence of resistance to WEE1i monotherapy is possible, we propose to identify new
strategies to overcome or prevent resistance using a new drug combination and exploring the potential
mechanisms of WEE1i resistance (Aim 2). Because the mechanism of action of WEE1i treatment is related to
its ability to cause defects in DNA replication fork, factors that respond to WEE1i treatment at DNA replication
forks are candidate regulators of drug responsiveness. We will use the identification of such factors to prioritize
candidate biomarkers of responsiveness as indicated by tumor genomic and gene expression studies (Aim 3).
In summary these studies will develop CCNE1 as a biomarker for WEE1i monotherapy for HGSC and test new
treatment options for CCNE1Amp HGSCs after progression on WEE1i. In addition, these studies will identify novel
candidate biomarkers of responsiveness beyond CCNE1 overexpression, while simultaneously investigating the
mechanisms that regulate the effectiveness of these drugs."
10935408,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer sequencing studies by our group and others have identified frequently occurring somatic mutations of a
chromatin remodeling protein, ARID1A, in Type I ovarian cancers including clear cell and endometrioid subtypes.
The mutations are mostly frameshift or non-sense types, resulting in truncated, unstable protein products.
Consequently, cancer cells with these loss-of-function ARID1A mutations (ARID1Amut) do not show detectable
ARID1A proteins and functionally lose cell cycle checkpoint control and have reduced DNA damage repair
capability.
The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the possibility that the functional characteristics of ARID1Amut
ovarian cancers can be exploited for developing effective treatments. Specifically, we will interrogate the
functional capacity of DNA base excision repair (BER) in ARID1Amut ovarian cancer cells and in endometrial
epithelial cells (the precursor of ovarian clear cell and endometrioid cancer) with engineered knockout of the
ARID1A gene. BER is considered a dominant repair mechanism for alkylating drug-induced or oxidative stress-
induced DNA lesions, and its function is often jeopardized in aging and in cancer cells. Based on higher
abundance of accumulated DNA base lesions and unresolved AP sites in ARID1A-KO vs –WT cells, we
hypothesize that loss-of-function ARID1Amut in cancer cells causes compromised base lesion DNA repair. A
BER defect in ARID1Amut Type I ovarian cancer would explain the selective sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, which
trigger replication stress response, replication fork arrest, and lethal DNA break formation as a result of excessive
PARP trapping. These characteristics in Type I ovarian cancer cells provide opportunities for highly specific
therapeutic approaches with significant potential for reduced toxicity to normal tissues and organs. The findings
will be pivotal for evaluating whether an oral alkylating drug, temozolomide, in combination with PARP inhibitors
represents an effective approach for treating ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which are often intrinsically resistant
to chemotherapy.
We will collaborate with Impact Therapeutics, Inc. to use the PARP inhibitor, senaparib (IMP4297), whose safety
and tolerability in combination with temozolomide has been reported in an ongoing Phase Ib/II trial for solid
tumors (NCT04434482). In the current study, we propose a Phase II clinical trial to evaluate efficacy of the
combination of TMZ and senaparib in treating patients with Type I ovarian cancers. The loss-of-function
ARID1Amut in Type I ovarian cancer cells provides an opportunity for a highly specific therapeutic approach with
significant potential of reduced toxicity.
The proposed studies are considered to be high impact because a comprehensive understanding of how
ARID1A-deficiency influences the cancer cell replication stress response and resultant effects on DNA replication
and damage repair may facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies that circumvent drug resistance
in ovarian cancer."

There’s emerging evidence that the genetic diversity of the mucophylic gut commensal
Akkermansia muciniphila contribute to this microbe’s overall impact on human health. Based on
our collaborative findings that Akkermansia can exacerbate GVHD following HCT, we predict
that the variance in genetic content among Akkermansia species and clades influences its
impact on GVHD either through variances in its mucin degrading capabilities or through the
regulation of intestinal epithelia and associated immune cells. We propose to define how the
genomic variation among Akkermansia species and clades modulate the risk of developing
neutropenic fever and GVDH following hemopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in humans and
mouse models of disease. We will test the premise that both mucin degradation by Akkermansia
and other commensal bacteria compounded by capsular polysaccharide-mediated
immunostimulation modulate the initiation and/or severity of disease. We will specifically ask: 1)
How does the genetic diversity of Akkkermansia in humans impact the severity of HCT-induced
GVDH; 2) What is the impact of mucin degradation by Akkermansia on the gut ecology and
damage to the GI by other mucolytic bacteria during HCT; 3) Does immune signaling induced by
the Akkermansia capsule modulate susceptibility to GVHD and 4) Does selective depletion of
Akkermansia with bacteriophages decrease the severity of GVHD in mouse models of HCT?"
10935586,"ABSTRACT
Curative therapy for multiple myeloma remains elusive despite remarkable advances in drug therapy, biologics
and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Adoptive cell therapy using T cells modified by gene transfer
to express synthetic chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T) that retarget specificity to a surface molecule expressed
on myeloma cells is an exciting advance and has been highly effective for reducing tumor burden and inducing
complete responses in a fraction of patients with refractory disease. Although the initial responses to CAR-T are
impressive, relapses are frequent and heterogeneity in the expression of target antigens on the tumor and lack
of CAR-T persistence have been identified as underlying causes for disease recurrence. The premise of this
proposal is that these barriers can be overcome by advanced approaches to T cell engineering. We will design
novel synthetic hybrid T cell receptors that have markedly greater Ag sensitivity compared to CAR-T and
simultaneously target more than one MM antigen to prevent escape of tumor cells expressing low levels of or
lacking a single antigen. A new approach that instructs memory and stemness transcriptional and epigenetic
states in engineered T cells that have been associated with superior T cell persistence after adoptive transfer
will be developed to improve therapeutic efficacy. Further advances in adoptive T cell therapy will be necessary
and should be informed by a comprehensive understanding of other mechanisms that enable rare myeloma cells
to persist in the bone marrow tumor microenvironment and regrow. We have assembled a rich resource of blood
and bone marrow samples obtained from patients prior to and at multiple time points after treatment with BCMA
targeted CAR-T cell and will use high dimensional analytic techniques to identify tumor intrinsic and extrinsic
mechanisms associated with response and relapse. By employing cutting edge synthetic biology and
immunologic techniques we will accelerate development of more effective immunotherapies for MM. The specific
aims are:
Aim 1: Design and evaluate highly sensitive chimeric TCRs that recognize two myeloma Ag.
Aim 2: Determine if inducing a memory stem cell phenotype in MM-specific T cells through CD27
costimulation improves antitumor efficacy.
Aim 3: Determine mechanisms of resistance in MM patients receiving BCMA CAR-T alone or
combined with a gamma secretase inhibitor."
10935587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for ~80% of adult acute leukemias and ~20% of childhood leukemias.
Among patients who initially achieve a complete remission with standard induction therapy, most will ultimately
relapse and die of disease-related complications. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has
reduced relapse rates and can be curative for many high-risk patients. However, HCT regimens can cause
considerable morbidity and mortality, and many high-risk AML patients are not candidates for HCT, due to age,
comorbidity and/or lack of an available donor.
Adoptively transferred autologous T cells engineered to express a high affinity T cell receptor (TCR) that
recognizes the AML-associated antigen Wilms’ Tumor Antigen 1 (WT1) represents a strategy to provide a
numerically potent immune response in the absence of HCT. WT1-specific T cells in vitro and in vivo can
recognize and kill leukemia cells due to the expression of abnormally high levels of WT1, without affecting normal
cells including hematopoietic stem cells that express lower levels of WT1. In two previous clinical trials, we
targeted the HLA A+02-restricted immunoproteasome (IP)-dependent WT1126-134 epitope, with CD8 T cell clones
or CD8 ‘TCRC4’-transduced T cells, documenting direct anti-leukemic activity and prevention of post-HCT
relapse. However, we noted AML escape after loss of IP expression and IP-dependent epitope presentation,
and/or limited persistence of transferred T cells in patients with abundant AML.
To overcome these obstacles, we now propose to utilize a high-affinity ‘TCRE50’ that targets the IP-independent
WT137-46 epitope and will be inserted in a lentiviral vector encoding CD8?? chains to produce WT137-46-targeting
CD4 and CD8 T cells. Moreover, autologous CD62L-expressing naïve and central/stem memory CD8 T cells will
be engineered, as these cells are associated with longer persistence in vivo. We plan a Phase I/II trial for
patients at high risk of AML relapse who are not HCT candidates. TTCR-E50 will be infused after induction
therapy. Shortly after the last infusion of TCR E50-engineered T cells (TTCR-E50), patients will receive azacitidine,
which can increase WT1 epitope presentation. We will use high dimensional analytic methods to identify TTCR-
E50 and AML cell parameters pre- and post-infusion that correlate with clinical responses vs. AML progression.
As the efficacy of transferred T cells has been shown to in part reflect the lack of tumor-associated costimulatory
ligands, we will also use in vitro and murine models to explore the pre-clinical safety and efficacy of providing
co-stimulatory/survival signals by co-transducing ‘switch’ receptors."
10935669,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 Our overall goals are to establish (i) whether the hijacking of emergency myelopoiesis (EM) pathways
represents a shared mechanism of leukemogenesis in the context of different leukemic and pre-leukemic muta-
tions, and (ii) whether such a shared mechanism links clonal evolution in AML with environmental inflammatory
changes in aging and disease development. Hematopoiesis is a demand-adapted system in which self-renewing
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and downstream hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) integrate
signals from their bone marrow (BM) environment to adapt blood production to the need of the organism. In
regenerative conditions, this results in the transient engagement of EM pathways before a return to homeostasis.
During leukemia development and aging, EM pathways are constitutively engaged, likely in response to envi-
ronmental inflammatory changes. It is now increasingly appreciated that EM pathway activation represents a
distinct trajectory of myeloid development, which depends on unique HSPC signaling states, transcriptional reg-
ulation, and cell behavior. Just as normal hematopoiesis is regulated by the epigenetic landscape of HSCs, acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease largely driven by epigenetic dysregulation, with mutations in epigenetic
modifiers like DNMT3a that are also found in age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH). However, beyond HSCs,
little is known about the epigenetic regulation of HSPCs, or the role of inflammatory stress and EM pathway
activation in AML pathogenesis. Our objective is to determine how engagement of EM pathways contributes to
epigenetic dysregulations and AML development by promoting clonal evolution and emergence of leukemic stem
cells (LSC) from pre-leukemic HSCs. In Aim 1, we will use our newly established atlas of EM pathway activation
to establish core and AML-specific EM-associated programs in diverse leukemic and pre-leukemic models to
identify putative interactions between hematopoietic and stromal populations that regulate EM pathways. We will
search for shared regulatory mechanisms between AML progression models, explore how they relate to human
AML, and spatially map the tissue architecture of leukemic hematopoiesis. We will also investigate the epigenetic
consequences of EM activation in AML and determine how DNMT3a mutation affects EM pathway regulation
through extensive functional analyses. In Aim 2, we will use Dnmt3amut ARCH and Dnmt3amut:Flt3ITD AML pro-
gression mouse models together with state-of-the art CARLIN clonal/lineage tracking approaches, powerful in
vivo CRISPR/Cas9 functional screening, and several modalities of repeated EM pathway engagement in primary
human cells and humanized mouse models to probe the role of EM pathway activation in clonal competition
between normal and pre-leukemic HSCs, and test whether EM induction is sufficient to drive progression of pre-
leukemic HSPCs to AML transformation. Collectively, these approaches will provide a comprehensive assess-
ment of the role of EM in AML development and identify key regulatory nodes that could be exploited transla-
tionally to disrupt EM pathway activation and prevent disease progression in multiple subtypes of leukemia."
10935670,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated the existence of preleukemic (preL) HSPC (which includes the
phenomenon of age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH)) in human MDS and AML. In the majority
of patients, the disease clone occurring at relapse/progression is not directly derived from the
initially transformed LSC clone through the acquisition of additional mutations, but is rather arising
from preexisting preL-HSPC clones. These observations have fundamentally challenged the
classical model of linear-divergent tumor progression, and indicate that heterogeneous
preleukemic cell states early in the transformation process hold the key for understanding the
origin of tumor heterogeneity, stem cell subclonal dynamics, competition and selection, and
progression and death of patients. We have previously discovered that mouse/human double
minute 4 (MDM4/HDM4; synonym: MDMX/HDMX) is significantly overexpressed in the vast
majority of patients with AML, including at the stem cell level. Elevated MDM4 expands and
increases competitiveness of preL HSPC, promotes ARCH/MDS-to-AML progression in several
newly developed mouse models, and patient data indicates that MDM4high MDS patients are at
significantly higher risk to progress to AML. For this project, and based on published and newer
preliminary data, we hypothesize that MDM4 overexpression acts in ARCH/MDS-to-AML
progression in the context of microenvironmental changes and selection pressures that are
frequently encountered during aging and inflammatory stress. Preliminary data imply specifically
the βcat/Cnot6l axis as well as IL-1 signaling in the progression of Mdm4high ARCH/MDS to AML. We
will determine the role of stromal and inflammatory changes in selection, expansion, and
progression of the MDM4high pre-leukemic stem cell pool; identify and functionally characterize
molecular mechanisms employed by the stroma and inflammatory stress that mediate MDM4-
dependent progression of ARCH and MDS, using a combination of CITE-seq, subclonal tracking,
spatial mapping, and analysis of select targets on longitudinal samples during progression; and,
examine whether preemptive combinatorial targeting of the MDM4/TP53 interaction and cell
extrinsically-driven pathways can prevent progression of ARCH and MDS by testing clinically
available inhibitors of MDM4/TP53, combined with either genetic or pharmacologic targeting of
identified stromal and inflammatory pathways. These studies will provide novel mechanistic
insights into combinatorial cell-intrinsic/extrinsic preleukemic to AML progression as well as a
preclinical proof-of-concept for the design of preventative clinical trials in the future."

Every living organism possesses a defense system crucial for distinguishing self from potentially harmful
foreign invaders. This defense system is essential for survival and is finely tuned to protect against threats that
may compromise the organism's integrity. The long-term goal of this proposal is to unravel the immune
surveillance mechanisms employed by a new class of immune GTPases, the 65~120kDa Guanylate binding
protein-like (GBPL) proteins, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Preliminary evidence suggests
that this new three-member GBPL protein family bridges both sensing and sterilizing activities in plants via
mechanisms distinct from well-established plant defense pathways. We are focused in part on how GBPL1, a
pseudoGTPase, fine-tunes immune homeostasis as a negative regulator of defense. Here a combination of
targeted mutagenesis, structural modeling and organismal genetics will be used to determine the sequence-
enzyme relationships governing GBPL1's functions and, in turn, understand its implications in host defense.
We are also testing the importance of GBPL2 to act as a broad-spectrum danger sensor under physiological
conditions to elicit sterilizing activities. This will be examined using powerful host-pathogen genetics,
biochemistry and advanced imaging strategies to unveil the intricate molecular processes that enable GBPL2
to sense external cues and trigger effective immune responses. Lastly, we are exploring the role of GBPL3 in
enhancing defense responses and influencing gene expression through the realm of biological phase
separation. We are employing facile protein organelle biochemistry, proteomics, imaging and reconstitution
techniques to probe how GBPL3 condensates are regulated in vivo in the context of infection. Collectively, this
research addresses fundamental questions in plant host defense and offers insights into immune mechanisms
applicable to diverse organisms including humans."
10939236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower-chlorinated polychlorinated biphenyls (LC-PCBs) are emerging as a significant risk to human health, and
a primary target of concern is the developing brain. Briefly, LC-PCBs are present in the serum of pregnant women
at increased risk for having a child with a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD). Moreover, LC-PCBs, such as
PCB 11, and their metabolites formed via diverse mouse and human cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated
oxidation promote dendritic and axonal growth in vitro via activation of CREB-dependent signaling pathways.
Building on these findings, the parent grant investigates how CYP-mediated metabolism influences the in vivo
effects of LC-PCBs on CREB-dependent neurodevelopmental processes using state-of-the-art mouse models
that express human CYP2A6 or CYP2B6 but not mouse Cyp2a, 2b, 2f2, 2g1, and 2s1 proteins (Cyp2abfgs-null
mice). This supplement leverages the animal studies performed as part of the parent grant and investigates if
LC-PCBs, such as PCB 11, indirectly affect toxic outcomes in these mouse models by addressing the following
questions: 1) Can LC-PCBs also become bioactivated in non-hepatic tissues (e.g., brain, lungs, and ovaries)
through cytochrome P450 enzymes that are not currently known to be involved in LC-PCB metabolism, and 2)
does hepatic and non-hepatic LC-PCB metabolism alter hormone homeostasis in key endocrine organs, such
as the ovaries, thus indirectly affecting normal neurodevelopment? These questions arise from observations that
PCBs are oxidized by cytochrome P450 enzymes other than Cyp2a and Cyp2b enzymes, and a hydroxylated
PCB 11 metabolite, but not the parent PCB11, displays estrogenic activity. These findings suggest that LC-PCB
metabolites formed by hepatic or extrahepatic metabolism may impact endocrine systems to alter
neurodevelopment indirectly. Building on these discoveries, we propose to test the alternative hypothesis in this
workforce diversity supplement that, in addition to hepatic metabolism, extrahepatic metabolism contributes to
the formation of LC-PCB metabolites that affect systemic hormone homeostasis (e.g., by altering estradiol
synthesis of the ovaries), thus indirectly altering neurodevelopment. To test this novel hypothesis, we will 1)
determine the extent to which PCB 11 is metabolized by extrahepatic tissues in vitro and in vivo, and 2)
investigate the link between PCB 11 metabolite levels and dysregulation of estrogen synthesis in the ovaries in
mice exposed developmentally to PCB 11. The anticipated outcomes of these studies include the identification
of LC-PCBs as a new class of environmental contaminants that interfere with neurodevelopment and novel
mechanistic data regarding the role of extrahepatic metabolism in PCB DNT. Together with findings from the
parent grant, this research will impact public health by providing critical mechanistic insights regarding the
plausibility of dietary and/or pharmacological manipulation of CYP activity to mitigate DNT risk in vulnerable
subpopulations."

There has been considerable concern regarding the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), largely
driven by reports of neurodegenerative proteinopathies associated with participation in contact sports. In
addition, increasing epidemiological data indicates that even a single moderate or severe TBI can increase the
risk of dementia. While there has been a particular focus on the role of tauopathies following TBI, our group and
others have demonstrated often complex and diverse neuropathologies with late survival post-injury in some
individuals. However, the mechanisms driving these pathologies are poorly understood. In addition, to date there
has been limited success in attempts to model both the neuropathological and clinical features of post-TBI
neurodegeneration. As such, in order to permit mechanistic and translational studies of TBI-related
neurodegeneration, there is a pressing need to develop preclinical models that recapitulate the complex
pathologies and clinical phenotypes in the chronic phase post-injury.
To address this critical knowledge gap, we propose an iterative design to develop novel gyrencephalic models
of post-TBI ADRD. Three novel and distinct injury paradigms are proposed to represent repetitive mild
exposures, as well as diffuse and focal TBI. We propose carefully considered biomechanical inputs relevant to
real-world scenarios, with rigorous characterization of the nature and progression of neuropathological outcomes
up to 1 year post-injury. The clinical relevance of pathologies will be determined via parallel and standardized
comparisons with well-characterized human tissue samples from the CONNECT-TBI archive. Face validation
will be determined through novel cognitive assessments, with additional validation attained via measurement of
advanced neuroimaging and blood biomarker outcomes. Critically, reproducibility will be assessed at a second
site. If successful, the development of a model with validated clinical relevance will provide a vital platform to
study TBI-related neurodegeneration, including the assessment of novel diagnostics, and potential therapeutic
interventions. Moreover, studying the evolution of pathology following the initiating injury may offer critical
insights to the pathogenesis of TBI-related neurodegeneration."
10933870,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The oligomeric forms of two amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, Aβ40 and Aβ42, are considered as the primary toxic agents
in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the exact conditions leading to the onset and progression
of Aβ oligomerization in the brain remain largely unknown. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments show that Aβ
aggregation is promoted by increased Aβ concentrations, low pH, and elevated ionic strengths. These conditions
are transiently met in the extracellular space (ECS) in the brain during metabolic stress and spreading
depolarization (SD) associated with numerous pathologies, including ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid
hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, and migraine. All these conditions are risk factors for developing sporadic
AD. The low-pH conditions are also met in endo/lysosomes. Accordingly, we will test the hypothesis that
recurrent metabolic stress and SD events promote Aβ aggregation in the ECS and/or in endo/lysosomes. The
proposal further posits that short-term episodes of brain acidification and/or ion increases might result in different
populations of Aβ40 and/or Aβ42 aggregates than chronic, repetitive episodes. However, the wide range of
spatiotemporal scales involved and the dynamic nature of the complex interactions between different Aβ species
and physiochemical variables in the brain preclude testing these hypotheses through experiments alone.
 We propose to use novel approaches in multiscale modeling, high resolution microscopy, antibody staining,
and measurement of paralysis phenotype to determine the role of the drastic physiochemical changes due to
metabolic stress and SD in the onset and progression of Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregation in the brain. We will achieve
this by using a range of innovative techniques: 1) high resolution imaging, optical spectroscopy, and
conformational-specific antibodies to determine how KCl, NaCl, pH, and Aβ concentration affect different
aggregate species of Aβ40 and Aβ42; 2) Markov chain models and Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithms to investigate
Aβ aggregation at a wide range of spatiotemporal scales from nanoseconds to months and nanometers to tens
of micrometers; 3) biophysical model for metabolic stress and SD, taking into account dynamic changes in ion
concentrations and pH in the ECS, neuron, and astrocyte; cell swelling and shrinkage of ECS; O2 homeostasis;
and neurovascular coupling; 4) detailed model for the function of endo/lysosomes under physiological conditions
and metabolic stress; 5) a comprehensive model to investigate the aggregation of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the ECS
and endo/lysosomes in the neuron and astrocyte simultaneously in brain region-specific manner; and 6) paralysis,
phenotype, antibody staining, and microscopy to test model predictions in the C. elegans strain JKM7 expressing
the human Aβ42 peptide. In addition to understanding the conditions leading to the aggregation of Aβ40 and
Aβ42 at spatiotemporal scales that are not possible to explore through experiments alone, the resulting brain-
region specific models for the function of neurons, astrocytes, neurovascular coupling, and endo/lysosomes will
find broader applications in computational neuroscience."

Recent drugs for treating obesity and diabetes, while promising, have major side effects. For example, drugs
that reduce food intake by targeting the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) or the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
(GLP1R) induce side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Several drugs targeting these receptors likely act in
part via effects on neural activity in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVH). My collaborator, Brad Lowell, and others have shown that AgRP and POMC neurons in the ARC are
each necessary and sufficient to strongly affect daily food intake, in large part via actions on PVH neurons that
express MC4R (PVHMC4R). Yet, manipulation of these or other cell types one at a time does not accurately mimic
what occurs during a meal, when many neuron types change their activity simultaneously and in different ways.
For example, we and others showed that AgRP neuron activity decreases and POMC neuron activity increases
during feeding. Critically, our lab recently discovered that jointly mimicking these opposing shifts in activity using
a combined optogenetic and chemogenetic approach is far more effective in reducing food intake than
manipulating either type alone. We will test whether coordinated regulation of activity in AgRP, POMC, and
many other feeding-related neuron types can be achieved using AI-guided combinatorial pharmacology,
and whether this more effectively promotes satiety and reduces body weight in a mouse model of high-
fat diet-induced obesity. However, a major overarching challenge in basic and clinical studies of neural control
of energy balance is that effective tools for jointly and selectively activating or inhibiting many specific neuron
types are either very challenging even in mice (in the case of 2 types8) or do not exist in any animal model or in
humans (>2 types). Further, many off-target effects of drugs likely arise from actions on off-target neuron types,
and from the fact that target ‘neuron types’ found to regulate satiety are actually composed of multiple molecularly
and functionally distinct subtypes.
I hypothesize that a novel computational pharmacology approach can
overcome limitations in coordinated optogenetic control of many neuron types and subtypes, while providing a
more direct bridge to novel drug therapies. Our lab is taking a unique approach to this challenge, using machine
learning algorithms together with single-cell sequencing of the unique repertoires of receptor expression across
dozens of satiety-related neuron types in hypothalamus and other brain areas. Using this approach, we have
devised mixtures of 2-10 ligands that can jointly activate or inhibit all or specific transcriptional subtypes of AgRP
or POMC neurons while sparing other neuron types. We will directly test the impact of increasingly high-
dimensional mixtures on various satiety-related neurons using 3D two-photon calcium imaging and
pharmacology in brain slices or in awake mice during feeding behavior, followed by 3D spatial transcriptomics
to identify the molecular identity and receptor repertoire of each imaged neuron. We will develop optimal mixtures
to selectively promote and sustain satiety in either lean mice or in obese mice prior to and following weight loss."

While the racial and ethnic diversity of the US has increased over time, the diversity of those involved in cancer
and biomedical research has not reflected the overall US population; only about 11% of researchers overall are
from racial/ethnic minority groups. These under-represented groups include women; Blacks/African Americans;
Hispanics or Latinos; those with disabilities; residents of rural or medically underserved area; students from lower
socio-economic status (SES) or are first in their families to attend college. Rural students, in particular, represent
only 3 out of every 10 students pursuing STEM careers and their families tend to come from lower SES and less
education. Rural students begin high school with the same interest in STEM as students from higher SES
suburban schools but often decrease interest by junior year. The importance of community is not consistently
included in pipeline programs; yet, many of the communities where under-represented students reside will
experience significant cancer disparities. Thus, the goal of pursuing cancer research to reduce disparities in their
community may be highly relevant. In this Georgia Science Education Initiative NCI YES (GA-YES) program,
the theme of cancer disparities will be integrated into all student research projects, the curriculum development
process, and community outreach and engagement components. Based upon these concepts, our hypothesis
is that by focusing on cancer disparities that impact the students’ own communities, this approach will enhance
student motivation to continue to pursue future STEM/biomedical studies in higher education and ultimately, in
a future career in cancer research. By exploring the underlying mechanisms, epidemiology, risks, and potential
interventions that might affect these disparities, this approach would serve to engage students more deeply and
demonstrate the applicability of the science and research to the student’s own community setting. To investigate
this hypothesis, our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To recruit high school students under-represented in STEM
careers from six high schools located in a rural, persistent poverty county in Georgia to participate in a summer
mentored cancer research training program focused on cancer disparities at the Winship Cancer Institute of
Emory University. Aim 2: To develop and test an accompanying curriculum focused on cancer science, research
skills, health equity and career development that engages students all year-long. Aim 3: To facilitate student
outreach and engagement with communities to receive feedback related to research projects and educate
community stakeholders about cancer research, including clinical trials. Aim 4: To evaluate short- and long-term
program outcomes, student characteristics, and track student participants for 15 years post-enrollment to assess
primary outcomes (pursuing a career in cancer research or biomedical sciences).The impact of this proposal
will be in contributing long-term program evaluation with measurable outcomes for best practices in building a
diverse future workforce for cancer and biomedical research careers, by integrating cancer disparities into
research training, with a novel focus on under-represented rural and lower SES students."

or genotypes within cells and tissue. However, our current imaging modalities are not
capable of simultaneous functional imaging of molecules/proteins and structural imaging
of cellular and subcellular features in whole tissues, limiting both our fundamental
biomedical understanding of diseases and strategies for treatment. Leveraging recent
advances in the development of photoemission electron microscopy for high-resolution
imaging of biological tissue for volume electron microscopy, the proposed research
program seeks to develop BRAVE-EM, Biological Real-space Absorption Visualization by
photoemission - Electron Microscopy, to combine the wavelength specificity of optical
light microscopy with the spatial resolution and volume imaging of electron microscopy.
Developing BRAVE-EM will enable imaging of fluorescent molecule and protein labels in
biological tissues with spatial resolution <20 nm, while remaining compatible with recent
advances in the volume electron microscopy infrastructure. Using volume electron
microscopy and BRAVE-EM, we will answer questions in cancer biology, such as how
heterogeneity in cancer-associated fibroblasts and variations in protein expression in the
tumor stroma of pancreatic tissue samples influences cancer metabolism and disease
progression."

 Type-B aortic dissection is a disease with a tear of the intimal layers of the aorta distal to the aortic arch and
separation of the wall layers in the thoracic aorta, which may extend further. It is rare but life-threatening when
left untreated since the weakened aortic wall could rupture resulting in internal bleeding, and the false lumen
may disrupt the normal blood supply to the kidneys, intestines, and spinal cords. As a less-invasive surgical
treatment, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) covers the dissected aorta with an endograft by
inserting it through a distal vessel and deploying at the dissected region to seal the tear. Major concerns
persist with the long-term TEVAR outcomes when multiple endografts and stents are implanted to treat
extensive dissection. Two or more endografts are needed to cover extensive dissection since there is no
standalone endograft which can cover the entire region. Extensive use of endografts can impact the
biomechanics and hemodynamics of the aorta which requires careful pre- and post-TEVAR planning. After
TEVAR, the aorta undergoes remodeling over time. Regular monitoring with computed tomography (CT) is
necessary to keep track of aortic remodeling. The common radiographic features including aortic diameter and
luminal volume are insufficient to predict long-term aortic remodeling. This investigation addresses the unmet
need to assess the long-term impact of multiple endografts on the aorta. To this end, we will identify the key
features to quantify aortic remodeling during the 1-year follow-up period. This investigation aims to
characterize the long-term impact of extensive TEVAR on the aorta by identifying underlying biomechanical
and hemodynamic features due to this condition. This will be achieved by identifying biomechanical features to
characterize aortic remodeling triggered by extensive TEVAR (Specific Aim 1) and evaluating the impact of
blood flow on aortic remodeling during the long-term follow-up (Specific Aim 2). To achieve these aims, we will
utilize patient-specific CT at pre-, post-TEVAR, and 1-year follow-up, computational modeling, computational
fluid dynamics, and feature correlation. Outcomes of this investigation will provide powerful features
representing the adaptation of the aorta to extensive TEVAR and help guide optimal surgery to promote
favorable aortic remodeling. Our techniques of feature identification using patient-specific CTs and
computational analysis will be valuable in refining patient selection criteria for extensive TEVAR, helping
strategic decisions for surgery, and planning for post-surgical surveillance."

The promise of marrow transplantation (HCT) has been hampered by the threat of relapse, opportunistic infection
(OI) and graft-versus host disease (GVHD). These three complications interlock in a Gordian knot that have
traditionally precluded independent resolution strategies. In theory, better targeted GVHD prevention would
reduce the need for additional immunosuppression (IS) post-HCT, and subsequently lower the rates of OI, as
well as of relapse, by conserving the graft-versus tumor (GVT) effect. Transformative advances in the realm of
GVHD prevention have been possible due to creative immunomodulatory approaches targeting T-lymphocytes,
such as early in-vivo T-cell modulation (post-transplant cyclophosphamide or PTCy based strategies) and co-
stimulation blockade of the T-cell and antigen-presenting cell (APC) interaction (Abatacept/Aba). In addition, with
a deeper understanding of the role of humoral immunity in chronic GVHD (cGVHD), we and others have shown
that B-cell blockade using monoclonal antibodies can be very effective in the prevention and treatment of
cGVHD. Hence, we are entering an era in transplantation where we have in a sense, an embarrassment of riches
of potential therapeutics, but have yet to establish which of these could be the most effective GVHD prevention
strategy, to cut the proverbial Gordian knot, and result in the best patient outcomes. In this project, we focus on
the most effective strategy to prevent acute and cGVHD, while maintaining the GVT effect, with acceptable rates
of OI. First, we expand on our prior work which has shown that co-stimulation blockade of the CD28/CTLA-4
interaction with Aba (CTLA-4 Ig) results in T-cell inhibition and reduction in aGVHD lethality, first shown in murine
and non-human primate models, and then established in early phase and randomized clinical trials. We propose
to incorporate Aba with standard of care (SOC) tacrolimus (Tac) and methotrexate (MTX) peri-transplant for
reduction of aGVHD. Further, recognizing that does not prevent cGVHD, we seek to develop a cGVHD
prevention strategy adjunctive to Aba, leveraging our insights from basic murine and human studies indicating
that germinal center formation, the development of autologous and allogeneic antibodies, and B cell cytokines
are all important in the generation of cGVHD, This will further expand on our work over the last decade, showing
that CD20 targeted monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, Obinutuzumab/Obin) can effectively prevent
moderate/severe cGVHD, when given in the first year post-HCT. We propose a 2 arm, phase II randomized trial
comparing the combination of Aba/Tac/MTX/Obin (ATOM) with PTCy/Tac/mycophenolate in the myeloablative
(MAC) unrelated donor setting (URD) using peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), to establish the most effective
transplant platform to optimize GVHD and non-GVHD outcomes. The intermediate goal is to compare the ability
of each therapy to achieve the best GVHD free relapse free survival outcome after 2 years. The long-term goal
is to allow us to pick-the-winner for a definitive larger phase III randomized controlled trial to establish the SOC
in MAC URD PBSC HCT."
10937648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed project is a physics and biology collaboration at the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) to
model morphogenesis processes in the developing vertebrate eye. We will create new, quantitative, biophysical
models of choroid fissure closure and of foveal pit formation, test these models against experimental data from
zebrafish and other organisms, and iterate to refine the models and maximize their predictive power. The project
design is cutting-edge, yet accessible to undergraduate (UG) participation. UNC physics and biology majors will
be recruited and engaged in all aspects of research, including experiment design and execution, computer
simulations, presentation of results at conferences, and preparation of manuscripts for submission to journals.
The overall project goals are to: 1) address a basic research need for quantitative models of eye morphogenesis,
incorporating key new data and unifying principles of central nervous system morphogenesis, 2) illuminate
relationships between molecular regulation and mechanical forces giving rise to shape changes in the eye, and
3) study mechanisms of developmental eye disorders, such as coloboma (failure of choroid fissure closure) and
foveal hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the foveal pit). These goals align with NIH’s mission “to seek
fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems” and with NEI’s strategic plan. They
also target AREA priorities to provide UG research experiences and enhance the PUI’s research environment.
We will achieve these goals by executing three independent Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to iteratively develop and
validate a novel bilayer vertex model of choroid fissure closure in zebrafish. In Aim 1a we will code the wildtype
model into simulation software that can be run by undergraduates on a supercomputing cluster. In Aim 1b
undergraduates will carry out experiments with zebrafish embryos, genetically and/or chemically manipulating
cadherins, actin, and “pioneer cells”. Each manipulation will correspond to a parameter in the bilayer vertex
model, enabling validation and refinement of the model at each experimental step. Aim 2 is to extend a “tension-
based morphogenesis” model of cerebellar foliation to the developing retina, with its similar cell types, but
different geometry and growth profile. We will determine if these model inputs lead to foveal shape outputs that
resemble concaviclivate foveas seen in nature (preliminary results suggest they do). The model analysis will be
incorporated as a project in the PUI’s existing required course, Computer Applications in Physics, as part of the
mathematical training for UG physics majors working on this Aim. Finally, Aim 3 builds on preliminary work,
already involving four UGs, that investigates elastic creasing instability as a potential mechanism of foveal pit
formation. Creases on compressed surfaces of elastomers bear a remarkable resemblance to convexiclivate
foveal pits such as those in Anolis lizards. We will specifically investigate creases formed in spherical shells that
mimic the retinal geometry, and validate our experimental results with finite element simulations using the neo-
Hookean hyperelastic model in COMSOL."
10937773,"Project Summary: Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) are 65 years of age or older. Radiotherapy
(RT) is an effective and curative treatment for early-stage PCa. However, 20% of PCa patients can develop late,
often irreversible, chronic adverse side-effects after their RT. Radiation cystitis (RC) is a clinically significant
chronic toxicity. Symptoms of RC include hematuria and urinary dysfunction, including increased urinary
frequency and urgency, incontinence, and dysuria, and these can be significant clinical concerns for the ~3.1
million PCa survivors in the US. These symptoms can be more pronounced in older PCa patients because of
preexisting urinary symptoms and/or reduced functional reserve, putting them at increased risk of dysfunction
after RT induced injury.
RT dose-volume constraints are used to lower the risk of developing a treatment-related toxicity, but the bladder
cannot be avoided completely in the PCa RT treatment plans, and significant variation in the incidence and
severity of RC exists amongst PCa patients which suggests an important role for host factors personal to each
PCa patient. The urinary microbiome is altered in urologic diseases common in older adults, and dysbiosis has
been linked with urinary dysfunction unrelated to infection. But, no studies have investigated the effect of RT on
the urinary microbiome, or the effect of dysbiosis on RC, among PCa patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that
RT-mediated urothelial damage in the bladder that leads to disruption of routine urinary function, and increases
urinary frequency, will produce urinary microbiome dysbiosis, and therefore microbiome dysbiosis could be a
non-invasive urine-based early biomarker of RC. Our clinical genetic studies identified signaling pathways linked
to the microbiome and immune cell recruitment that support this hypothesis. Using banked urine from our
prospective clinical study of RC with up to 5 years of follow-up, as well as our preclinical mouse model of RC,
we have demonstrated we can detect a urinary microbiome despite the low abundance, and we show evidence
of dysbiosis after RT. This project will use banked urine from our clinical study to test the hypothesis that (i) the
microbial composition and/or metabolic potential of the urinary tract is changed by RT, and (ii) dysbiosis and/or
metabolic dysregulation will correlate with patient reported outcomes (PROs) capturing bladder dysfunction
following RT. Then, using our mouse model of RT-induced bladder injury, we will test the hypothesis that (iii)
changes in the microbiome may serve as a potential biomarker of RT injury to the urothelium, and if changes in
microbiome are a response to tissue injury and recruited immune cells. This will be achieved by comparing
dysbiosis with functional micturition, and local and systemic biomarkers of bladder injury, after focal RT to the
entire bladder volume or just bladder trigone. Finally, using banked urine from both our human and mouse
studies, we will evaluate whether a mitigator if radiation-induced bladder injury (angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors) exerts its protective effect by altering inflammatory and immune processes thereby avoiding dysbiosis."
10937178,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a nanoscopic lipid-enveloped biological entity. Despite the existence of highly
effective treatment plans, this pathogenic particle remains responsible for thousands of deaths each year in the
United States. At the core of this particle lies a genetic message comprised of a single RNA molecule, the vast
majority of which encodes for a roughly 3000 amino acid-long polyprotein. However, there are 98 nucleotides at
the very end of the single-stranded HCV genome that do not encode proteins and yet are essential for the virus.
These nucleotides make up the so-called 3ʹX RNA, which is a structured and highly conserved RNA element
that has been implicated in the regulation of several different RNA-dependent viral processes like replication,
translation, and particle assembly. Many research groups have proposed that this riboregulatory behavior arises
from this RNA's ability to form mutually exclusive interactions with other highly conserved RNA elements within
the HCV genome. Unfortunately, the fundamental biochemical principles governing these RNA-RNA interactions
have not yet been established, which greatly limits our ability to predict which of these mutually exclusive
interactions will be formed under specific conditions and ultimately how the formation and disruption of them
regulate various viral processes. This research project will begin to address these unknowns by determining the
major structural, energetic, and kinetic principles that govern these riboregulatory interactions involving the 3ʹX
RNA. These fundamental insights will be obtained by studying fluorescently labeled HCV RNAs at the single-
molecule level using FRET spectroscopy and microscopy with additional support from cryo-electron microscopy
as well as more conventional electrophoretic and chromatographic approaches. Our findings will allow us to
construct a quantitative physical model that highlights the biochemical function of this highly conserved non-
coding viral RNA and its various interaction partners. Not only will this knowledge enhance our understanding of
HCV and the diseases it causes, but because these regulatory RNA-RNA interactions often appear in other non-
viral RNAs, it will also positively impact several other areas of general RNA biology."
10937288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the genetic variation that underlies differences in survival and reproduction is
essential to the study of biology and human disease. While most studies of adaptation have
focused on traits driven by loci of large effect, the majority of variation in survival and
reproduction is due to variation at complex traits, which involve many loci throughout the
genome and are influenced by the environment. The majority of these human trait associations
are found in non-coding regions, suggesting that genetic variants that affect gene regulation
play an important role in trait variation and fitness. However, few studies have been able to
connect genetic variants affecting gene expression with complex traits in natural populations,
limiting our understanding of the genomics of adaptive evolution. The overarching goal of this
work is to identify specific loci involved in complex trait variation affecting fitness in natural
populations. Previous work has often fallen short of this goal due to (1) a lack of power for
detecting variants of small or modest effect involved in trait variation, or (2) the difficulty of
linking variants under selection to traits in natural populations. The proposed work will overcome
this limitation by integration studies of tissue-specific assays of gene regulation, surveys in
natural populations, and the use of new sequencing and computational approaches. First, we
will identify gene regulatory variation associated with ecologically and biomedically significant
traits (e.g., body mass and composition, blood chemistry measures, renal physiology, and
behavior/activity level) by combining tissue-specific measures of allele-specific expression and
chromatin accessibility with population genomic scans for selection. Then, we will use
ecologically relevant treatments to examine the effect of environmental variation on gene
expression levels and identify gene-by-environment interactions, as well as test the importance
of these interactions to adaptive evolution. Finally, we will use scRNA-seq data and gene
regulatory network reconstruction to examine how gene regulatory networks evolve in the
process of adaptation. Altogether, this work will directly address the challenge of connecting
genotype to phenotype for complex traits with implications for the genetics of human health and
disease."

Only 0.01% of cancer cells enter circulation, survive & produce metastasis, however, metastatic disease
accounts for 90% of cancer-related deaths. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), the majority of patients
present with extra-pancreatic invasion and metastatic disease for which the there is a dismal five-year survival
rate and no specific therapeutic strategies directed at the treatment of metastatic disease. Notably, much of the
research into the mechanisms of metastasis has been focused on identifying early drivers within primary tumors,
however, the identification of central drivers of metastatic outgrowth within established lesions largely remain
unexplored. Recently, we have demonstrated that SIRT6 inactivation dramatically accelerates PDA
development, resulting in highly aggressive metastatic disease in the Kras-p53 GEM model. Employing this
highly aggressive PDA metastasis model, in addition to an established breast cancer metastasis model, this
study aims to identify potential vulnerabilities of metastatic lesions that could be exploited to treat patients with
advanced metastatic disease. Performing unbiased RNA-Seq on matched primary and metastatic tissues
followed by a newly developed 96-well soft agar screen, we identified factors that are uniquely required for
anchorage-independent growth of established metastatic cells. Utilizing this functional screen and validation, we
have identified Gstt1 (glutathione S-transferase theta 1) as a top candidate driver of metastatic outgrowth in
multiple mouse models of metastasis. Preliminary data demonstrates that Gstt1 is differentially expressed in
metastatic cell lines compared to matched primary-derived cell lines and inhibition of Gstt1 significantly reduced
metastatic potential of metastases-derived cells, without affecting primary tumor growth, suggesting an important
role for Gstt1 in the outgrowth of established metastatic lesions. Additionally, within metastatic lesions, Gstt1
shows a heterogenous expression pattern, where Gstt1high cells represent an aggressive, non-proliferative sub-
population. Additionally, we have demonstrated that Gstt1 is required for the formation of tumor spheres in breast
and PDA metastatic-derived cell lines in vitro, suggesting a role for Gstt1 as a driver of self-renewal in metastatic
cells. In this proposal we seek to identify characteristics unique to Gstt1high PDA-derived metastatic lesions. The
proposed studies will provide important preclinical demonstration of whether Gstt1 and its downstream targets
are required for sustained growth of metastatic tumors, thus identifying a possible therapeutic window for this
subset of metastatic PDA."

Chemical modifications to synthetic DNA are of central importance to both: 1) understanding biology and disease
and 2) enabling a wide range of biomedical applications and research tools. However, despite their importance,
most modification patterns are not possible to make and those that are are exorbitantly expensive to synthesize
(by at least 10x), in contrast to the rapidly dropping costs for unmodified DNA synthesis. The central challenge
is that the most advanced methods to create modified DNA oligos continue to rely on phosphoramidite synthesis,
an organic chemistry process that uses harsh reaction conditions that require expensive chemically protected
monomers and associated deprotection steps, or that simply prohibits certain types of modified DNAs from being
synthesized at all. To address this challenge, we have developed a robust platform technology capable of pro-
ducing chemically modified DNA. It is technologically differentiated from the current state of the art through its
use of sustainable enzymatic synthesis in mild and low temperature conditions, compatibility with a diverse range
of modification types, and low cost and recycleable templates and reagents. The proposed work seeks to ad-
vance the commercial potential of this technology by: Aim I – creating modified DNA products that cannot be
ordered from any existing vendor; Aim II – developing an innovation on our technology that will eliminate the
most costly reagent in our synthesis process, the biotinylated template; and Aim III – establishing and mapping
the breadth of modifications that our platform technology can incorporate into DNA oligos and their relative syn-
thesis efficiencies."

The goal of this proposal is to create a National Resource in Glycoscience that will offer service and hands-
on training for compositional analysis and detailed structural characterization of all classes of
glycoconjugates, including glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and glycolipids, to the greater scientific
community. The Complex Carbohydrate Research Center (CCRC) at the University of Georgia has been
home to two NIH/NIGMS federally funded resource centers: the National Center for Biomedical Glycomics
(5P41GM103490), where new technologies in mass spectrometry and transcriptome analysis have been
developed to investigate glycomics and glycoproteomics of stem and differentiated cell types; and the Research
Resource for Integrated Glycotechnology (5P41GM103390), in which mass spectrometry, NMR, molecular
modeling, chemical synthesis and cell based assays have been used to investigate the molecular basis of
protein-carbohydrate interactions. The CCRC service facility has offered a variety of complementary services
using technologies developed by both research resources that are now mature and completely translatable to
investigating the glycomes and glycoproteomes of any tissue or cell type. Since the NIGMS Research Resources
have recently been sunsetted, we propose to combine the “high demand” services from each resource and
create a “National Glycoscience Resource”-CCRC Service and Training (GlyCore) that will enable us to continue
to offer and enhance our cutting edge services in glycoscience, hands-on training courses and workshops and
to make them easily accessible to the biomedical science community. GlyCore will offer a comprehensive list of
services, including isolation and purification, as well as NMR and MS characterization of all glycoconjugates that
are grouped into several categories and are integrated together to help solve particular problems in glycoscience.
In order to better make our technologies available to outside investigators, we will also continue to offer four well-
received and well-established hands-on training courses in glycoscience. Our experience has demonstrated that
the one-on-one format of our training is extremely effective in achieving acceptance of tools in glycoscience. We
have a combination of state-of-the-art NMR and MS instruments and well-trained scientists with particular
expertise and track record for service and training in carbohydrate structural analysis. We have fully implemented
and well-developed protocols for sample receipt, sample handling, sample tracking, storage, data archiving, and
reporting that provide our users with security and analytic outputs of uniform quality. The number of research
groups that have been impacted by our service and training activities spans the whole country and extend
globally. We have built an easily accessible “go-to” service and training facility through extensive outreach
activities, including our Glyco-booth at meetings, seminars, and workshops at conferences, and building close
relationships with universities, scientific non-profit organizations, and industries."

 RNA sequences have pervasive roles in biology and RNA molecules are also important
pharmaceuticals. Many of these RNA molecules function by use of specific structures, and these
structures are therefore conserved across evolution. With the availability of high throughput
methods to identify RNA transcripts and probe structure, there is a need to model these structures
to get the most information from available data. The goal of the Mathews lab is to develop
algorithms and software to model RNA structures, including secondary and tertiary structures.
We focus on using biophysical principles, and we are also at the forefront of incorporating
additional information in our models, including experimental mapping data and structure
conservation. Here, we will build on the foundation of prior work to develop new structure
prediction methods. We provide our software freely to the community and we rigorously test our

10940600,"Project Summary
The majority of Parkinson’s disease (PD) cases are not caused by an inherited monogenic mutation and
disease etiology involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies show
that pesticide exposure, particularly to organochlorine pesticides such as dieldrin, increases risk of sporadic
PD. In a model of increased PD susceptibility, mice exposed to dieldrin during development show male-specific
increased susceptibility to adult exposure to the dopaminergic toxicant MPTP and, in new data from our
NIEHS-funded R21, α-synuclein (α-syn) preformed fibrils (PFFs). The epigenome is a potential mediator of this
relationship between developmental exposures, increased neuronal vulnerability, and adult disease. In line
with this idea, we recently identified sex-specific differential methylation patterns in response to developmental
dieldrin exposure. We hypothesize that dieldrin-induced epigenetic modifications during development
cause changes in gene expression and phenotype that persist into adulthood, altering the sensitivity
to parkinsonian insults and contributing to the development of PD.
To test this hypothesis, we will determine cell-type specific DNA modifications and expression profiles of
previously identified candidate genes in the dieldrin model (Aim 1); analyze the function of synaptic terminals in
our novel dieldrin/PFF two-hit model (Aim 2); and determine if dieldrin or altered expression of candidate genes
affects susceptibility to α-syn PFFs in a dopaminergic neuron cell culture model (Aim 3). The long-term goal
of these experiments is to determine whether dieldrin-associated differentially methylated genes play a
functional role in the biological response to parkinsonian toxicity.
Completion of these aims will further the mission of NIEHS to increase our understanding of how the environment
affects people in order to promote healthier lives, with a specific project goal of connecting exposures with
functional changes in gene expression, neuronal phenotype, and PD susceptibility. The experiments proposed
here will help to establish a biological mechanism linking developmental exposure to late life disease. This project
will also expand our repertoire of tools for interrogating the function of epigenetic changes by establishing an in
vitro experimental paradigm to connect specific epigenetic mechanisms with parkinsonian toxicity. With our in
vivo model that combines developmental exposure with adult PFF injections, we will have a set of experimental
systems in place that will allow us to test a wide variety of exposures, as well as combinations of exposures,
both in vivo and in vitro. Together, this suite of tools will enable us to explore the mechanisms by which PD-
related exposures alter neuronal vulnerability in PD, furthering the goal of NIEHS to understand how combined
exposures affect disease pathogenesis and individual susceptibility."

Interactions among different organs are pivotal in developing pathological conditions like obesity and type 2
diabetes. Substantial research efforts have been directed towards comprehending how communication between
cell types such as adipocytes, hepatocytes, and islets contribute to and respond to specific disruptions
associated with metabolic diseases. There remains an essential yet relatively unexplored question: how does
the secretome of the mammary gland's luminal epithelium influence inter-organ communication in the context of
obesity? Breastfeeding holds a significant role in promoting the health of mothers and reducing the risk of
diabetes, benefiting both maternal and neonatal health. It also protects against cardiovascular diseases, obesity,
and other metabolic disorders for both the mother and child. However, obesity can disrupt mammary gland
function and development, potentially affecting maternal well-being and the health of offspring. Recent
technological advancements, such as single-cell transcriptomics and precision proteomics, have opened up
opportunities for unbiased exploration and the discovery of signaling molecules involved in inter-organ
communication. We recently employed a bioinformatics framework based on single-cell transcriptomic
correlations, integrating data from multiple datasets with publicly available resources to identify secretory factors
from mammary duct luminal cells that influence surrounding adipocyte metabolism. We refer to these factors as
""mammokines."" Our innovative research endeavor seeks to combine transcriptomics and proteomics to unveil
the ambiguities surrounding the mammary gland's function as an endocrine organ and the impact of obesity on
its action. The primary goal of this project is to discover new mammokines that may have vital roles in paracrine
and endocrine signaling, influencing the function and homeostasis of the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and the
mammary gland itself, potentially affecting the progression of obesity and Type 2 diabetes phenotypes. These
mammokines could serve as valuable biomarkers for obesity and diabetes in women. We also aim to determine
which pathways are conserved from mice to humans and investigate the physiological consequences of
disrupted endocrine communication through functional experiments. The success of these objectives relies on
integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, computational, and experimental approaches, which is supported by the
extensive training and expertise of the Principal Investigator and collaborators. We believe this research has
great potential to advance our understanding of women's metabolic health and inspire innovative strategies for
obesity and diabetes therapy."
10912492,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This is a Type 2 renewal application aimed at building on the progress over the initial funding period to develop
new therapies for patients with melanoma and studying the mechanistic basis of response and resistance to
melanoma immunotherapies. We made significant progress in the three scientific areas of the initial funding
period. We defined genetic mechanisms of primary and acquired to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) through
loss of function mutations in the antigen presenting machinery and the interferon-gamma (IFN-g) signaling
pathway, which led us to successfully test combination therapies in mouse models and bring them back to
patients in ongoing clinical trials. In the scientific area of combinatorial approaches of immunotherapy and
targeted therapy, our mouse model data provided the justification for three triple therapy (BRAF plus MEK
inhibitors and anti-PD-1 or -PD-L1) clinical programs, one of them resulting in an FDA approval. In the scientific
theme of advancing gene engineered adoptive cell transfer (ACT) therapies, we have conducted three clinical
trials, developed optimized means to isolate T cell receptors (TCRs), helped develop an approach for non-viral
T cell gene editing, and develop approaches to provide superior cytokine support for in vivo T cell expansion.
The new R35 proposal has three themes. Theme 1 is centered on how cancer cells are recognized or escape T
cells, focusing on the antigen presentation machinery. It will use a repository of 1,031 already collected biopsies
that will be analyze using newly developed methods of isolation, sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. Theme
2 is based on the key role of IFN-g in shaping an antitumor immune response; the realization that this cytokine
turns the cancer cells into enablers of the antitumor immune response provides opportunities for exploiting the
knowledge to improve immunotherapies. This will be achieved using CRISPR and drug screens in a panel of
melanoma cell lines, followed by pathway analyses and mechanistic studies hopefully leading to new
pharmacological targets to improve IFN-g antitumor activity. Theme 3 is focused on the T cell function and target
recognition, and in particular in avoiding T cell dysfunction upon repeated antigen exposure, which is a major
limitation to long term antitumor responses. This project will use CRISPR screens in T cells undergoing repeated
antigen exposure to find genes that, when knocked-out, result in superior ability of T cells to maintain their
functionality upon repeated TCR engagement. Furthermore, we will analyze the transcription factors that guide
a superior in vivo expansion and antitumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells.
In conclusion, the new R35 proposal builds on the science from the current OIA. We propose to use state-of-
the-art approaches to analyze large numbers of patient biopsies, use CRISPR screens for mechanistic analyses
and use model systems to improve responses and treat resistance to cancer immunotherapies.

Black emerging adult college men (BCM; 18−29 years) in the U.S. experience more alcohol-related health

behavioral economics theory to develop engagement strategies for a behavioral mHealth intervention; (3)
implementing novel experimental approaches (i.e., micro-randomized trials; MRTs), to increase mHealth
engagement; and (4) building skills to successfully direct a research lab and mentor a diverse lab of students.
Training objectives will be met through a comprehensive training plan involving: (1) ongoing individual
meetings with mentors (Drs. Naar, Murphy, Nahum-Shani, and Li), to learn from their combined expertise in T1
translation of health intervention, behavioral economics, mHealth, MRT research design, and statistical
analyses; (2) courses, workshops, and seminars; (3) conferences and professional development. Skills gained
through the training plan will be applied to a project capitalizing on Phases I and II of the ORBIT model in
preparation for Phase III. To address Aim 1 (Phase 1), in Years 1−2, we will analyze focus group data collected
from BCM drinkers at a predominantly White institution to develop and refine strategies drawn from behavioral
economics (i.e., episodic future thinking, reciprocity) to increase engagement in a mindfulness application
(app) for binge and heavy drinking BCM. To address Aim 2 (Phase I and II), across Years 2−4, we will use a
pilot-MRT to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect of the Aim 1 engagement strategies to
engage binge and heaving drinking BCM (N = 40) in a mindfulness app. Participants will be randomized to one
of three conditions (episodic future thinking, reciprocity, or no prompt conditions). A baseline survey, ecological
momentary assessments, paradata, and a post-pilot MRT individual exit interview will assess feasibility,
acceptability, and the preliminary effect of the engagement strategies delivered as text-based prompts in a
smartphone to increase engagement in mHealth mindfulness, reduce stress, and ultimately alcohol
consumption in BCM. The proposed studies will provide pilot data for Dr. Marks’ first R01 submission to
NIAAA, to be submitted in Year 5. The proposal is aligned with the NIH Research Career Development’s goal
of ensuring the training of a diverse pool of scientists to address U.S. behavioral and biomedical needs."
10912603,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 More than 50 million people over the age of 65 are currently affected by vascular
cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Although the specific mechanisms for aging-
induced VCID are not yet known, there is increasing evidence that alterations of the
neurovascular unit play a crucial role. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the
mechanistic role of senescence-related endothelial dysfunction in cognitive impairment. The
central hypothesis is that aging primarily promotes endothelial senescence in the brain and
subsequent dysfunction, altering the production of vasodilator mediators, impairing
neurovascular coupling responses, promoting blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and
microvascular rarefaction. The resulting decline in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and increased
neuroinflammation contribute to cognitive impairment. The proposed work is novel as it will be
the first to demonstrate that aging-induced endothelial senescence is a critical contributing
factor to the pathogenesis of VCID. The results will likely identify specific mechanisms and
reveal potential therapies that are capable of improving CBF and restoring learning and
memory. The following aims are proposed: 1) Determine how endothelial senescence alters
neurovascular coupling responses, CBF and cognition in aging. The working hypothesis is that
aging-induced activation of p16-dependent cellular senescence program in endothelial cells
impairs vasodilator function. It is predicted that elimination of senescent endothelial
cells, through genetic manipulation or through senolytic therapies will restore neurovascular
function and improve CBF and cognition in aged mice. 2) Determine how senescence alters
microvascular density and BBB integrity in aging. The working hypothesis is that activation of
p16-dependent cellular senescence program in endothelial cells impairs endothelial barrier
function and compromise the maintenance of the microcirculatory network. It is predicted that
elimination of senescent cells will restore BBB, attenuating neuroinflammation and increase
cerebromicrovascular density in aged mice. 3) Determine cellular heterogeneity among
senescent endothelial cells in conjunction with their morphological and functional
characteristics. Together, the proposed studies will identify a fundamental mechanism
governing aging-induced cerebrovascular changes eventually leading to cognitive impairment."

Epigenomics of Development and Disease
OVERALL
SUMMARY
The goal of this COBRE 3 application is to continue to sustain research in epigenetic mechanisms underlying
development and disease at the University of North Dakota by providing ongoing support to the Epigenetics
Working Group (EWG). In COBREs 1 and 2 the EWG made significant progress towards development of an
epigenetics/epigenomics program through support of individual projects, building our core group by recruitment
of epigenetics experts, and supporting faculty development through mentoring and accountability programs. We
established a comprehensive Genomics Core to meet the needs of the epigenetics community and provided
technical and financial support that increased the number of researchers in our community utilizing epigenetic
approaches. In Phases 1 and 2, our COBRE Investigators made important discoveries that resulted in 64 papers
published in high impact journals, 152 poster and oral presentations by Project Leaders at invited seminars or
scientific meetings, and the awarding of more than $26 million in external funding from R01, R21, DoD, NSF and
foundation grants.
In this proposal, we seek to maintain this momentum and transition our group towards sustainability through the
following strategies: (1) Promote high-quality research, expand the reach of the group through collaborations
with experts in other fields, and support innovative, cross-disciplinary research through a Pilot Project Program;
(2) Supporting the Genomics Core to enable performance of cutting-edge research, and empower researchers
through training and educational workshops in bench and computational epigenetics; and (3) Promote long-term
sustainability of the group through building partnerships with other IDeA state groups and cohorts and expanding
expertise to other fields such as clinical/translational science and Artificial Intelligence. Our long-term goal is to
transition the EWG into a sustainable scientific center dedicated to understanding molecular mechanisms of
developmental and pathological disorders that will attract top talent, train the next generation of scientists, and
become a national hub for cutting edge epigenetics research."

Disease relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and opportunistic
infection are major limitations of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that includes hematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT), chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic T cell therapies. Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) infection is a frequent and life-threatening infectious complication in these immune suppressed patients
that significantly limits the successful outcome of HCT. We have developed innovative preclinical models of CMV
reactivation and both leukemia and multiple myeloma (MM) relapse after ACT. In the HCT setting, we have
modelled the two most promising platforms to improve transplant outcome that were developed within the current
P01, namely naïve T cell (Tn) depletion and post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy). We demonstrate
profound effects on alloantigen driven T cell exhaustion, residual stem-like memory T cell populations and NK
cell expansion in the bone marrow. We plan to utilize our unique, but well-established preclinical models to define
the impact of these new clinical HCT platforms on the cellular and molecular pathways that mediate pathogen
and leukemia specific immune responses, with the aim of using new synthetic cytokines to enhance critical
protective immunity. We will expand these studies to new fully murine CAR T cell models of B cell leukemia and
MM, focussing on identification of pathways of both toxicity and immune escape, again with the aim of generating
new therapeutic approaches to optimize outcomes. These preclinical studies will be leveraged to expand and
optimize those planned in Projects 2 and 3. In this manner we will facilitate the development of a new generation
of cell therapies."

Successful execution of the Vesicant ExRC relies on the establishment of a strong Administrative Core (AC) to
oversee and coordinate all operations. By leveraging the administrative expertise and resources of the Wake
Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine (WFIRM), where most Vesicant ExRC operations will be co-located,
the AC will ensure bi-directional exchange and synergism among Facility Cores, NIH program managers, and
CCRP collaborators. The AC will be organized using program management principles developed by WFIRM
staff while managing more than $300M in large, multi-institution programs over the last decade. The AC will be
led by the Vesicant ExRC Director, who will be assisted by an Administrative Program Manager and a seasoned
administrative team already located within WFIRM. The AC will support management and research coordination
of the Vesicant ExRC via five specific aims: 1) establish business practices to guide Vesicant ExRC
programmatic and operational decisions; 2) facilitate communication among the Vesicant ExRC and NIH
leadership, CCRP-funded investigators, other ExRC facilities and stakeholders; 3) refine operating procedures
based on quality control and participant feedback; 4) establish training resources to educate the CCRP
community; and 5) develop an evidence-based transition plan to sustain CCRP function as an independent
facility. The Vesicant ExRC will be guided by a seasoned administrative team with proven expertise in managing
large, multi-institution programs involving academic and corporate participants. The implementation of proven
business practices throughout the Vesicant ExRC will support the CCRP community by accelerating exposure
operations, facilitating open and transparent practices, and establishing a sound foundation for conducting
rigorous and efficient Vesicant ExRC operations and transitioning to a self-sustaining resource after NIH support
is complete."

10935213,"7. Project Summary
There continues to be a documented dire national need for veterinary specialists trained
in biomedical research. Furthermore, veterinary researchers play a key role in
multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research activities since they naturally bridge basic
and clinical research. To address this training need, faculty in the North Carolina State
University College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) established the Interdisciplinary
Biomedical Research Training Program (IBRTP) for veterinary students in 2009 with funds
committed to the program from the College of Veterinary Medicine and the T35 was first
funded in 2010. The objective of this training program is to provide interdisciplinary
biomedical research experience specifically targeted to veterinary students with a strong
interest in a research career. The training program also serves as a bridge to foster new
interdisciplinary research collaborations amongst faculty members. Trainees complete a
3-month research experience in the laboratories of faculty members drawn from nine
disciplines. Trainees are mentored by two faculty members from different disciplines to
create and execute an interdisciplinary project. The 36 training faculty members
participating in this program are well funded and have a strong training track record. The
disciplines selected are areas of strength at NC State; cellular and molecular biology,
neurosciences, genetics and genomics, infectious diseases, disease modeling and
epidemiology, regenerative medicine, gastrointestinal physiology, computational biology,
and pharmacology and toxicology. Research projects emphasize integration of disciplines
to create a novel approach to a biomedical research problem. Projects combining clinical
and basic science disciplines are given priority. Trainees will be veterinary students in their
first or second year who are building on prior research experience. A total of 119 NIH
funded trainees have completed the program. We request in this renewal application that
the number of NIH funded training slots be maintained at 10 per year. Program
requirements include: 1) a weekly Principles of Comparative Biomedical Sciences seminar
series; 2) a seminar series on the Principles of Interdisciplinary Collaboration; 3) Scientific
Communication workshop; 4) training in responsible conduct of research, research rigor,
and data science and statistics; and 5) participation in the Veterinary Scholars Symposium

10935223,"Although various research institutions and clinics in the United States successfully train graduate students in
cardiovascular biology, specific training in lymphatic biology is lacking. Lymph transport is critically involved in
body fluid regulation, macromolecular homeostasis, lipid absorption, inflammation, and immune function.
Lymphatic dysfunction is central to a number of pathologies, including primary/secondary lymphedema that
affect millions of people worldwide. A dysfunctional lymphatic system also compromises the immune response,
further exacerbating a number of inflammation-related diseases. Despite these known impacts, until recently
the scientific and medical fields have not sufficiently recognized the importance of the lymphatic system. NIH
has in recent years implemented several funding opportunities that specifically target lymphatic research. This
effort has stimulated the growth of lymphatic biology research over the last decade. However, one of the
important issues is the paucity of scientific investigators trained in lymphatic biology research. While this
number has grown somewhat over the years, it is still an important limiting factor in the growth of
understanding of the lymphatic system. Thus, this application addresses the need to create interdisciplinary
programs to train new scientific investigators in the field of lymphatic biology. The proposed LYMphatics in
Pathology and Health (LYMPH) Training Program will directly address this need. Indeed, the Division of
Lymphatic Biology group at Texas A&M University has been doing so for the last decade, but the additional
resources provided by this T32 award would greatly accelerate that process. This application requests support
for 2 predoctoral trainees per year and for two consecutive years. Experienced investigators at Texas A&M
University in the principles of lymphatic biology will offer predoctoral students strong, research-oriented training
focusing on the principles of scientific methods and techniques, translational approaches, scientific
responsibility and networking, scientific presentation and writing skills, as well as management and leadership
training at Texas A&M University. This will produce well-versed, broadly trained, independent scientists to work
in the field of lymphatic biology. A total of 23 faculty mentors are currently participating in this integrative
LYMPH Training Program and the mentors’ research expertise extends across a variety of research areas,
from genomics to molecular, cellular, imaging, developmental, immunological, and physiological phenotypes
related to lymph transport and lymph flow mechanisms. Successful accomplishment of these goals will result in
a new cadre of competent young scientists in the lymphatic biology area, who can successfully develop novel
approaches in lymphatic research to aid in further understanding of the pathogenesis of lymphatic related
diseases and to provide novel targets to improve lymphatic function, thus reducing disease in patients
worldwide."
10936818,"High-throughput assessment of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in human cardiospheres
Project Summary
Chemotherapeutic agents including both traditional drugs (e.g., anthracyclines) and newer ones (e.g.,
proteasome inhibitors) are associated with cardiac adverse events including increased risk of arrhythmias.
Treatment for arrhythmias is difficult with currently available antiarrhythmic drugs. Development of effective
therapies is therefore highly desirable and can be facilitated by human cell models and high-throughput assays.
Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) have provided a new platform
for the studies of drug-induced side effects and disease modeling. hiPSC-CMs have translational potential to
improve current models by providing clinically relevant characteristics regarding disease phenotypes and
responses to drug treatment. They can also overcome the differences between human and animal cardiac
physiology and challenges in long-term maintenance of primary human cardiomyocytes.
Ca2+ handling abnormalities play a central role in the pathophysiology of heart failure and arrhythmias and could
be promising targets for novel therapeutics to treat chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, since chemotherapy
can cause Ca2+ to be released spontaneously at the wrong times during the heartbeat, thus inducing arrhythmias.
Our objective is to achieve an accurate and high-throughput Ca2+ transient recoding and analyses for functional
assessment of 3D hiPSC-CMs (cardiospheres). We expect that this technology will allow us to detect
chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and evaluate potential therapies in a highly efficient manner. Our proposed
study is an important component for the application of hiPSC-CMs in the study of chemotherapy-induced
cardiotoxicity.
Using our state-of-the-art equipment and computational tools, we aim to (1) establish high-throughput functional
assessment of human cardiospheres for the detection of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, and (2) evaluate
novel antiarrhythmic therapies to mitigate chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. The human cardiospheres will
provide a better model for chemotherapy-induced arrhythmias, since clinical arrhythmias result from the
collective behavior of cardiomyocytes within cardiac tissues. We expect that our high throughput functional assay
will facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets."
10936074,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Macrophages (Mφs) are innate immune cells, phagocytes and professional antigen presenting cells, which are
crucial for tissue homeostasis and adaptive immune response regulation. The high phenotypic and functional
plasticity and the high penetration rate in several solid tumor types including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) make Mφ cell therapy ideal for solid tumor treatment. To overwrite their immune suppressive program
once infiltrated in solid tumors, Mφs can be engineered with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to redirect their
specificity and function. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is a negatively charged amino-phospholipid mostly confined to
the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane bilayers, but flipped to the outer membrane under lethal stress. PS is
a universal “eat-me” antigen of apoptotic cells and often abnormally externalized by cancer cells. We hypothesize
that PS targeted CAR Mφs (α-PS CAR-Ms) may be a universal “third-party, off-the-shelf” adjuvant cell therapy
of traditional therapies for solid tumor treatment, because cancer treatment modalities such as targeted therapies
can induce transient but massive tumor cell apoptosis. To verify it, we employed KRAS-addicted PDAC models
for pilot studies and have created an α-PS CAR that can provoke antigen specific phagocytotic and cytotoxic
activities in Mφs against KRAS inhibitor (KRASi)-treated PDAC cells. Due to structure conserveness of PS in
human and mouse, α-PS CAR-Ms reacted with both mouse and human PDAC cells post KRASi treatment. In
the project, we propose to demonstrate the anti-tumor effect of α-PS CAR-Ms as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi
in human PDAC xenograft models and mouse spontaneous PDAC models and dissect the working mechanisms
of α-PS CAR-Ms. Aim 1. Demonstrate α-PS CAR activities in human PDAC models. Aim 1a will generate α-
PS CAR-Ms using human primary Mφs and perform functional assays in vitro to determine antigen-specific
phagocytosis and cell killing. In addition, we will explore whether combination with inhibitors targeting natural PS
receptors on Mφs and blockage of the “don’t-eat-me” signal will further enhance tumoricidal activities of α-PS
CAR-Ms. Aim 1b will determine the polarization status of α-PS CAR-Ms by flow cytometry analysis and dissect
the molecular reprogramming by -omic analysis. Aim 1c will demonstrate the tumoricidal activity of α-PS CAR-
Ms as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in human PDAC xenograft models. Aim 2. Determine the tumoricidal
activity of α-PS CAR-Ms in immunocompetent mouse models. We hypothesize that murine α-PS CAR-Ms
can not only kill PDAC cells directly but may also rewire the tumor immune microenvironment to further provoke
anti-tumor immune response. Aim 2a will produce murine α-PS CAR-Ms and determine their phagocytotic and
killing activities against KRASi-treated PDAC cells. After validation, we will examine whether α-PS CAR-Ms are
effective to impair tumor growth and prevent tumor recurrence as an adjuvant therapy of KRASi in spontaneous
PDAC mouse models. Aim 2b will characterize the TME remodeling by α-PS CAR-Ms via immunophenotyping
and delineate the potential intercellular crosstalk within immune cell types."
10936154,"Project Summary
Our research program focuses on the development of analytical tools to enhance the characterization of complex
biological systems. For rapid, real-time analysis of these systems, sensors based on spectroscopic,
electrochemical, and mass spectrometric detection have been widely utilized. However, the capability of these
approaches to simultaneously monitor multiple analytes suffers without the use of chemical separations. To
achieve sensor-like performance with a separations-based platform, this project focuses on the creation of a
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform for near-universal, real-time online measurement
of targeted small molecule metabolites. High-throughput gradient LC separations at capillary-scale flow rates will
be achieved through system miniaturization and improved microfluidic mixing combined with a droplet-based
injection approach. Improved analyte selectivity and sensitivity for targeted metabolites will be achieved with an
online benzoyl chloride derivatization device. To improve the temporal resolution of sampling, the derivatization
technique will be adapted to a segmented flow droplet format. Dual column re-equilibration will further increase
throughput by 20%, achieving an overall method cycle time of 10-15 s. By combining these fundamental
advances in separation science, a transformational measurement platform will be achieved. The system will be
used to specifically probe: (1) neurotransmitter release from organoid cell models of traumatic brain injury, (2)
polyamine secretion during bacterial biofilm formation, and (3) cell culture media nutrient depletion observed
during therapeutic antibody manufacturing."

Alzheimer's disease(AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, accounting for approximately 60-70% of all
dementia cases worldwide. It has been increasingly recognized that NAD+ depletion and elevated activity of the
cGAS-STING pathway are implicated not only in normal aging but also in various neurodegenerative conditions,
including Alzheimer's disease. NAD+ metabolite plays a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and is
considered one of the crucial hallmarks of aging and neurodegeneration. NAD+ depletion can trigger
mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, impaired lysosomal and proteasomal function, compromised adaptive
cellular stress responses, and hinder DNA repair mechanisms. Boosting NAD+ levels in animal models of AD
has been shown to ameliorate pathological features of AD. Interestingly our recent studies have demonstrated
that cGAS-STING activation induces NAD+ depletion in cell culture and mice. Considering this the novel
mechanistic link between cGAS-STING signaling and NAD+ depletion, we propose to gain insights into the novel
crosstalk between cGAS-STING pathways and NAD+ metabolism in the context of AD pathogenesis."
10934769,"Project Summary
Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of human suffering and mortality. While much research and
training has focused on studying infectious disease at a single scale (e.g. within hosts or at the population
level), a major challenge in the control of infectious diseases is that they routinely operate across scales.
Specifically, the interactions between host immune molecules and pathogens determine their transmission at
the population level, which in turn determines the spread of diseases across regions; in addition, a major
feature of emerging infectious diseases is that they infect a wide variety of non-human hosts, complicating their
control. Consequently, in order to effectively understand and control infectious diseases, researchers require
integrated training in interdisciplinary, cross-scale approaches that span the full range of biological
organization, from molecules to ecosystems. The Infectious Diseases Across Scales Training Program
(IDASTP) at Emory University provides such inter-disciplinary training. This program started in 2019, and
partners with 31 faculty to train 6 trainees and 4 affiliates each year. Trainees obtain two years of T32 stipend
support, as well as research and travel funds. Affiliates receive research and travel funds, provided through
institutional support. Students are recruited from a total of ~34 training-eligible students in six graduate
programs with exceptional strengths in immunology, microbiology, population biology, epidemiology,
biostatistics, and public health. IDASTP trainees and affiliates receive integrated training in cross-scale
infectious disease research through interdisciplinary curricula, an Infectious Diseases Across Scales Seminar,
and a Career Development Seminar. Seminars focus on the fundamentals of cross-scale interactions, control
applications and career development, providing workshops and exposing students to cross-disciplinary career
opportunities in academic and non-academic settings. Further training is provided through an Annual Retreat
with Science Communication Workshop and the Virulent Vortex podcast, in which trainees, faculty and
program alumni discuss their research and career paths. Further integration of student training across scales is
ensured by the formation of dissertation committees that include faculty with expertise in infectious disease
research at different scales. The overall objective is to train competitive scientists who use interdisciplinary and
cross-scale approaches to better study and control infectious disease. Graduates from this program acquire:
broad knowledge of cross-scale disease dynamics; in-depth knowledge of their field of research; the ability to
effectively develop research projects, grant proposals, presentations and publications; an appreciation of the
career trajectories available to infectious disease doctorates; and the ability to communicate their research to a
broad audience. This program at Emory University attracts and retains top-tier students and produces new
cohorts of specialists who can effectively tackle infectious diseases by utilizing cross-disciplinary tool sets."
10934028,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Language gives meaning to our inner thoughts, interacting with cognitive functions that flexibly manipulate
sensory content in mind. Language combinatorial capacities create meaning by combining symbols (words) and
rely on an extensive neural system, which when affected by neurological impact leads to disorders of language,
memory and thought. Although animal models have deeply informed understanding of neural systems for which
there are correspondences to human cognition, such as those for working memory, the neuronal mechanisms
of language and its entanglement with cognitive function remain poorly understood. The proposed
interdisciplinary team will seek to break through the status quo by leveraging a comprehensive research program
that can provide a well-powered study of human language and working memory interactions with unique scalable
data capable of resolving neural function across neocortical layers from single cells to systems. Aim 1a: Our
language Combinatoric Transformations via Working Memory (CTWM) task will be conducted with up to 100
patients across our neurosurgical partnering sites during high-density laminar array recordings in the operating
room from two key brain areas involved in language combinatorics and working memory. Aim 1b: Insights on
neuronal function across the cortical layers will be deeply informed by unprecedented information from single-
cell genomic and spatial transcriptomic analyses applied to tissue samples after task performance and the
laminar array recordings. Aim 2a is to investigate laminar information flow across the cortical array in local field
potentials, and Aim 2b in interaction with available (non-laminar) subdural intracranial EEG recordings from
other brain areas. Aim 3a is to pre-operatively scale insights to system-wide levels using laminar fMRI in the
same patients with the same task, and Aim 3b will integrate the combined neurophysiological and neuroimaging
data via a next-generation generative biophysical model. The anticipated outcomes are first-in-human insights
on the interplay between language and cognition, unique openly shared multi-modal data and a model that could
be applied world-wide to accelerate the understanding of human laminar circuit motifs in health and disease."
10934905,"Project Summary / Abstract
Glucose metabolism is tightly regulated and has a central role in cell biology, while dysregulated glucose
metabolism is a common occurrence in various metabolic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and
brain disease. Most glucose that enters a cell is shuttled through glycogen prior to re-entering the glycolytic
pathway, in a cycle known as the glycogen shunt. An important aspect of the glycogen shunt is glycogen
degradation, a compartment specific process that occurs either within the cytosol or lysosomes. The enzymes
glycogen debranching enzyme and glycogen phosphorylase mediate glycogenolysis in the cytosol, a process
that has been extensively studied and is well characterized in metabolism. However, the contribution of glycogen
autophagy (glycophagy) to metabolism and the glycogen shunt has not been characterized. Given the
importance of glycogen metabolism in health and disease and the lack of fundamental knowledge of glycophagy,
the overall vision for my lab over the next five years is to better decipher the mechanisms of glycophagy and its
contribution to the glycogen shunt and cell metabolism. We will utilize novel genetically modified cells and mice
that we have developed to study glycophagy. Additionally, we will establish new innovative tools that can be
leveraged to gain a better grasp of glycophagy in cell biology. The freedom and flexibility offered by the R35
grant mechanism will allow us to develop and employ these innovative tools that will enable influential discoveries
in glycophagy research. This fundamental understanding of glycophagy in metabolism that this work will provide
will benefit a broad array of genetic and metabolic diseases where glycogen metabolism is involved, such as
Pompe disease, Danon disease, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and brain disease. I will also advance my plan
for enhancing diverse perspectives during this award period. This will include forging strong transdisciplinary
collaborations to add unique expertise to help address our scientific questions. Moreover, I plan to recruit and
hire lab staff from historically underrepresented groups and varying scientific fields and provide them with an
array of training and mentoring opportunities to help them reach their personal and career goals."

the next generation of investigators have the skillsets needed to improve the healthcare and outcomes for
individuals with lung diseases with particular emphasis on lung cancer prevention, screening and
implementation, critical care, and rare lung diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis and cystic
fibrosis. Our interactive and interdisciplinary PuFFInS Training Program brings together a spectrum of well-
funded investigators across the Medical University of South Carolina, including clinician researchers,
epidemiologists, and cell biologists. The training program is structured to help trainees obtain the necessary
competencies and expertise for sustained careers in pulmonary medicine in a flexible framework that
accommodates a diverse range of prior education/experience. PuFFInS trainees may matriculate into one of
two research tracks with a foundation in innovation and entrepreneurship: a Clinical Science Research Track
focused on clinical trials, health service research, and telehealth research, and a Basic Science Research
Track. Training will be outlined in each Fellow’s Individualized Development Plan and guided by their selection
of a Primary Mentor in a pulmonary-related research area and Secondary Mentor to provide a complimentary
interdisciplinary scientific approach or clinical area of expertise. PuFFInS trainees will also benefit from core
and selective training options that include formal course work, workshops, training in the responsible conduct
of research, and retreats. The application requests support for 4 PuFFInS trainees per year. PuFFInS trainees
will be on the research training grant for two years. The Program Steering Committee will review and approve
the selection and annual re-appointment of PuFFInS trainees based on specified criteria and evaluation data.
A multi-year assessment plan will be used to: 1) assess each trainee’s performance and experience in the

Brain temperature regulation is crucial for neurologic function and recovery after ischemia and injury. Local
brain temperature increases as small as 1-2°C significantly contribute to the extent of ischemia-induced brain
damage, and dissociation of brain and body temperatures is a strong predictor of poor prognosis. While brain
temperature is well-recognized as an important clinical parameter for neuroprotection, current brain
thermometry has been limited to invasive temperature probes surgically implanted at a single location, making
it impractical in most patient cohorts. Several magnetic resonance (MR)-based thermometry methods have
been proposed and demonstrated in research environments; however, most are still limited to relative
estimations of temperature and are highly vulnerable to tissue heterogeneity-related errors. Body or systemic
temperature measurements are the most common surrogate, leaving brain temperature largely
uncharacterized in the clinical setting. To address these gaps in our understanding of brain temperature
regulation, biophysical models based on empirical data and simplified physical frameworks have been
developed. Recent models have made important progress in capturing brain anatomy and vasculature, but
crucial details with fundamental adherence to first principles of fluid and thermal energy transport have yet to
be formulated and implemented. Treatment of blood flow even in the most sophisticated models is ad hoc and
does not satisfy basic principles of momentum and energy conservation. The overall goal of this
Bioengineering Research Grant R01 proposal is to develop a new approach for in vivo MR chemical shift
thermometry that is complemented by a novel biophysical model of brain thermoregulation. In Aim 1 we will
implement corrections to MR-derived temperature calculations that will be validated and optimized in an animal
model and healthy human volunteers. Aim 2 will develop a 3D simulated model for subject-specific predictions
and quantification of brain temperature. Finally, in vivo brain thermometry will be acquired in a cohort of
patients with cerebrovascular disease, and injury will be incorporated into the simulated biophysical model to
facilitate subject-specific brain temperature characterization in Aim 3. We anticipate these studies will enable
important advances in non-invasive MR brain thermometry, facilitate evaluation of brain temperature as a
prognostic biomarker, and expand our understanding of brain thermoregulation and neuroprotection for
improved patient outcomes."

The path forward to a more diversified neuroscience research workforce is one that addresses persistent
challenges and emerging opportunities in a fundamentally changed, and continuously changing, professional
environment. Challenges to the status quo are happening at the societal level, and increased digitization offers
new opportunities to engage and encourage a diverse workforce to thrive in neuroscience and related fields.
Building on the assets and expressed needs of neuroscience trainees, the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) will
carry out a five-year continuation of the Neuroscience Scholars Program (NSP) to foster retention,
persistence, and career success of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from diverse backgrounds,
including from groups underrepresented in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. NSP’s extensive program
experience and recent external evaluations show a timely opportunity for the next program cycle to focus on
two overarching themes to meet needs of underrepresented neuroscience researchers (UNRs) in this ever-
changing world: (a) to support UNRs as agile and nimble leaders, with resources to navigate with greater
confidence, empowerment, and leadership in their professional environments, rather than simply “surviving” or
adapting, and (b) to foster a sense of belonging for UNRs in a global community of NSP participants,
alumni, and neuroscience leaders from multiple institutions that reinforces and supports thriving in the
neuroscience field. To address these themes over the five-year project period, Aim 1 supports the retention of
UNRs by providing at least 80 NSP Fellows with intensive in-person and online networking, mentoring, skills
development, and enrichment funds for research experiences. Aim 2 supports broader persistence efforts by
providing approximately 350 NSP Associates with career-building activities through online professional
development programming supplemented by targeted in-person experiences. Aim 3 supports the continued
career trajectory and long-term professional success of more than 1,200 NSP Alumni as leaders and mentors
in the NSP and broader neuroscience community. The primary delivery methods of the program will be new
courses for skills development including a focus on agile leadership and management skills, an update of
NSP’s existing library of courses, ongoing facilitated access to hands-on research experiences, and an
expanded mentoring program that includes a peer mentoring system. SfN anticipates this approach will
effectively facilitate NSP Fellows and Associates to gain a greater sense of identity as neuroscientists, and
along with Alumni, to experience greater confidence in their professional leadership abilities, facilitating
increased retention, persistence, and career success of UNRs. In this vein, NSP will contribute to a more
diverse research workforce that seeks answers to complex research questions relevant to diverse groups in
the general population and translates scientific findings into clinically significant and culturally appropriate
interventions that advance neuroscience and related fields."

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease, and it is the leading cause of mortality in the
US. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is used for non-invasive functional ischemic assessments, in the
management of patients with known or suspected CAD. Qualitative MPI (most commonly with single-photon
emission computed tomography or SPECT in clinical practice) is predominantly used for the evaluation of
regional perfusion, but it suffers from limitations in the assessment of patients with multi-vessel disease,
microvascular diffusion, and diffuse atherosclerosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an alternate to
SPECT as it can provide a far superior spatial resolution and concomitant anatomical characterization. MRI MPI
is currently done with gadolinium-based contrast agents, but this technique is also qualitative/ semi-quantitative,
and Gd is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic renal insufficiency who are also disproportionately
affected by heart disease. LadeRx is developing an MRI contrast agent based on manganese chelated to
bisphosphonate (MnBP), which will enable quantitative myocardial perfusion imaging with concomitant
high-resolution anatomical data in a single exam. This will substantially improve the accurate diagnosis and
management of patients with coronary artery disease, particularly patients with multivessel disease. In
preliminary data obtained in mice, MnBP, administered intravenously at a low dose of 1mg/kg showed a stable
contrast enhancement of cardiac tissue lasting >40 minutes. T he remainder of the complex was rapidly cleared
from the blood via renal and liver-gallbladder pathways, avoiding unwanted deposition in other tissues. MnBP
also demonstrated rapid elimination in a renally-impaired mouse model. In this Phase I STTR project, LadeRX
will advance the development of the MnBP contrast agent by validating quantitative myocardial blood flow
measurement and determining the pharmacokinetics profile and biodistribution of MnBP in rat. Aim 1:
Demonstration of absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) measurement with MnBP-based MRI: MR signal
changes at rest and in adenosine-stressed rats will be compared to fluorescent microsphere spectroscopic
determinations of absolute MBF using the same animals. Milestone: A linear relationship is obtained between
MRI signal changes, relaxivity mapping and MBF. (ii) The kinetic model that enables absolute MRI MBF
determinations in ml/min/vol is established. Aim 2: Determination of pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of
MnBP in biological tissues at relevant and excess dosing by comparing ICP measurement of Mn and MRI T1
mapping. Milestone: Mn does not accumulate in off-target organs at optimal (1X) dosing. Accumulation is absent
or limited excess (5X, 10X) dosing. An initial safety margin is determined for formal toxicology studies in higher
animals in Phase II."

This application is for a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to provide dedicated career
development training for Dr. David Lee to launch his own independent research program. Dr. Lee has conducted
basic science research in the areas of muscle cell biology, aging and metabolism. This K01 will enhance Dr.
Lee’s ability to 1) become an expert in biology of Fibro/Adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs) and muscle fibrosis,
2) conduct mass spectrometry-based science with state-of-the-art equipment, 3) use novel computational
approaches to perform informatics analysis on large scale metabolomics data (to go form spectral peaks to
specific pathways), 4) develop and implement strategies to manipulate Wnt driven glycolysis in FAPs to
counteract muscle fibrosis and 5) develop high-quality independent research program that will allow collaborative
and inclusive opportunities for science. To achieve the goals, Dr. Lee has devised a clear and focused training
plan with clearly assigned individuals who will each contribute unique expertise to the aforementioned areas of
training. Dr. Lee’s primary mentor is Dr. Christopher Newgard (career development, metabolomics
interpretation). Dr. Lee’s Co-mentor is Dr. James Bain (mass spectrometry, metabolomics). Dr. Lee has also
enlisted three Research advisors: Dr. Jianhong Ou (Bioinformatics, -omics data reduction/interpretation), Dr.
Matt Hilton (career development, FAPs biology), Dr. James White (muscle, aging, sarcopenia).
There exists a heavy social and economic cost associated with lost independence and mobility due to muscle
weakness and injury. There are currently no effective strategies to fully counteract sarcopenia to restore mobility
and strength. No rigorous research has investigated the fibrogenic development of FAPs in age-related muscle
fibrosis, and I hypothesize that FAPs could be a cellular target for anti-fibrosis therapies to delay or prevent the
loss of muscular strength in the context of sarcopenia. The first objectives (Aim 1) of the proposed studies are
to determine the onset of FAP fibrogenesis through a time course study of sarcopenia development to inform
therapeutic strategy. Second (Aim 2), I will determine if greater FAP glycolysis is a driver of FAP fibrogenesis
using orthogonal metabolomics and glycolytic flux analysis. Finally (Aim 3), informed by my preliminary data, I
will mechanistically determine if Wnt signaling drives FAP glycolysis and fibrogenesis making it a target for anti-
fibrosis therapy to delay muscle weakness in sarcopenia. Together, the K01 training and mentorship will enable
Dr. Lee to transition into an independent research career and become a leader in developing therapeutic
strategies to combat age-related muscle weakness and fibrosis for translation therapeutics."
10936799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding what shapes patterns of genetic diversity in natural populations is an inherently challenging
problem. Despite the challenges, studying variation in DNA sequences within individuals in a population has
the power to yield insights into selective pressures operating in the natural environment of a species, uncover
historical events like the migration of humans and their pathogens across the world, and identify the genetic
basis of traits like human diseases. One major challenge facing population-genomic inference is that most
current state-of-the-art approaches have been developed to study human-like genomes, that are sparsely
populated with functionally important elements and thus effects of selection on nearby sites can be ignored.
These assumptions however do not apply to compact (gene-dense) genomes where direct and indirect effects
of selection are pervasive. My research program is geared towards understanding how the joint effects of
selection with other evolutionary processes operating simultaneously in a population, shape patterns of
variation across the genome. As many pathogenic species tend to have highly compact genomes, experience
strong bouts of selection as well as drastic repeated bottlenecks, and undergo asexual reproduction or self-
fertilization often (which further increases the effects of selection), our methods would be absolutely essential
to perform inference in such species. We will employ computational, statistical, and theoretical approaches to
broach these questions, utilizing the development of new methods and their applications to publicly available
whole-genome sequence variation data.
 The strength of selection against new mutations, a crucial piece of information for modeling how
selection shapes variation, has been estimated predominantly for coding regions, despite the fact that in many
species the majority of functional DNA that impacts fitness is non-coding. My first goal will therefore be to
generate a better estimate of the shape of the genome-wide fitness effects of new mutations. As lower rates of
recombination result in stronger effects of selection, my second goal is to better understand how selection
against deleterious mutations affects genome-wide patterns of variation in species that undergo high rates of
self-fertilization and to develop methods that account for the effects of selection. My third goal is to apply our
methods to perform inference of demography and identification of recent selective sweeps in species with
compact genomes, like those of Plasmodium falciparum and vivax. My work will result in a better
understanding of how natural selection shapes genomic variation, as well as the development and application
of methods that jointly account for multiple evolutionary processes. This will be crucial to perform accurate
evolutionary inference in compact genomes. My long-term vision is to apply our methodological advances to
human pathogens to learn about their population history and adaptation to their hosts."
10937067,"A prosthetic socket is perhaps the most important part of a prosthesis because it allows force and energy
to be transferred between the residual limb and prosthetic components, and influences successful
rehabilitation following lower-limb amputation. People with lower-limb amputation are typically fit with a rigid
prosthetic socket. However, the use of a prosthesis incorporating this type socket has led to negative
secondary conditions such as osteoarthritis, back pain, residual limb skin breakdown and discomfort; 57% of
prosthetic users are dissatisfied with the comfort of their prosthesis. People with unilateral transtibial or
transfemoral amputation typically walk with asymmetric biomechanics, such as ground reaction forces, joint
motion, and joint kinetics. People with unilateral amputation typically compensate for the functional loss of the
muscles and tendons of the affected leg with greater forces borne by their unaffected leg. Asymmetric forces
likely contribute to the higher prevalence of osteoarthritis and low back pain in people with a leg amputation.
Pain and improper fit of the socket can result in loss of material, time, and money for patients, prosthetists, and
manufacturers. An adjustable socket that accommodates residual limb volume fluctuations could allow
prosthetists to optimize socket fit for each patient, which could reduce the risk of comorbidities such as
osteoarthritis, pain, and the need to re-fit prosthetic sockets in the long term. Moreover, use of an adjustable
socket design has the potential to improve function and comfort of Veterans with lower limb amputation.
 Quorum Prosthetics (Windsor, CO) has developed a new modular adjustable socket, the Quatro socket,
that could decrease biomechanical asymmetry, decrease movement of the residual limb relative to the socket
(socket pistoning), and improve comfort and satisfaction during walking due to its ability to accommodate
residual limb volume changes of up to 12%. The Quatro socket is produced by 3D printing high-strength Nylon
12, which is stronger and lighter than typically used carbon fiber; 3D printing also decreases build time and
allows customized changes down to 80 μm in thickness. Each socket can be custom printed from a scan of a
patient's limb, cast, or existing socket, so it is form-fit to the individual user. The Quatro socket utilizes 3 Boa
dials (Boa Technology, Steamboat Springs, CO) that ratchet to tighten or loosen cables that run through 4
padded panels to quickly and systematically adjust the volume and compression of the socket around the
user's limb. This technology allows a user to don or doff the socket in ~20 sec and adjust for volume changes
up to 12%. We will determine the effects of using a conventional rigid and an adjustable Quatro prosthetic
socket with the same suspension and prosthetic components on the biomechanics, socket pistoning, and
comfort/satisfaction of 10 female and 10 male Veterans with a unilateral transtibial amputation (Aim 1) and of
10 female and 10 male Veterans with a unilateral transfemoral amputation (Aim 2) during walking.
 Subjects will walk on a force-measuring treadmill at 0.75-1.5 m/s on level ground and at 1.0 m/s on
uphill/downhill slopes of 3° and 6° using each socket. After each set of trials with a socket, subjects will
complete a modified questionnaire (PEQ) that assesses their comfort/satisfaction. Prior to and each year for 4
years after enrollment, subjects will be asked to complete a PEQ. An adjustable prosthetic socket could
improve the mechanical coupling between the person and prosthesis and reduce their biomechanical
asymmetry, which could enhance function and lower the risk of secondary injury. Decreasing socket pistoning
could reduce skin irritation and breakdown, which may lower abandonment of prostheses. A better fitting
socket could improve comfort, satisfaction, rehabilitation, and function for Veterans with amputations, which
could ultimately improve their quality of life. Our results can also be used to inform future prosthetic socket
designs. In these ways, our research will advance knowledge in rehabilitation research, directly benefit
Veterans, and contribute to the quality of services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs."
10937074,"All manual lifting and repositioning techniques have a high-risk for injury to caregivers.
Work-related back pain and injuries are a widespread epidemic and due in large part to
repeated patient handling activities, including lifting, transferring, and repositioning tasks. Bed to
chair and chair to toilet transfers are consistently ranked among the most physically stressful
tasks required of patients and caregivers. Mechanical transfer assist devices were found to
reduce the risk of injury to caregivers. Consequently, the United States (US) government
passed a bill in 2006 requiring all hospitals to establish a no manual lift policy for staff members
who interact directly with patients to reduce the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders.
The most commonly used lift technologies for dependent transfers of patients include the
overhead ceiling lift, the floor-based sling lift, and the Gantry lift. While these devices allow for
safer transfer of patients, they do so with shortcomings. Overhead sling lifts require extensive
installation that may not be suitable for homes or buildings with structural deficiencies or a low
ceiling. Floor-based sling lifts have several issues with caregiver manipulation and ease of use.
Gantry lifts are very difficult to move and store due to their size. Research has demonstrated
that people with mobility impairments and caregivers both desire new, powered devices for
safer and more comfortable and independent transfers.
 The AgileLife Patient Transfer and Movement System (PTS) developed and
commercially deployed by Next Health LLC is an integration of several assistive technologies
that together automate the transfer of immobile individuals to and from a hospital bed and a
wheelchair. The PTS includes a hospital bed, an integrated and detachable
wheelchair/commode chair, a docking system, and a transfer ‘sheet’ that moves the individual to
and from the bed. However, the existing PTS has not been designed to work with a power
wheelchair.
 The goals of this project will be to iteratively design, prototype and test a modified PTS
and group 3 power wheelchair so that the PTS and power wheelchairs could be compatible,
allowing it to be used by a greater number of people with physical disabilities. This will be
accomplished by refining design specifications with a focus group of end user including group 3
wheelchair users and caregivers. Then developing a prototype and testing it for functionality and
safety. User testing will then be conducted by having group 3 wheelchair users and caregiver
pairs trial the prototype and complete usability questionnaires. A physical therapist will also rate
the safety of the transfers during the user testing."

IPMK is a novel PI3K crucial for AKT activation and cell migration. Our previous research demonstrated that the
loss of IPMK's PI3K activity impairs PDK1's membrane localization, disrupting PDK1-mediated AKT
phosphorylation. To achieve complete AKT activation, phosphorylation by mTORC2 is essential. Interestingly,
mTORC2 activation relies on PIP3. The essential PI3K responsible for generating PIP3 required for mTORC2
activation remains unidentified. Our investigation is focused on understanding the mechanism behind the
activation of mTORC2 by PI3K IPMK. We aim to decipher the impact of IPMK's PI3K activity on mTORC2
activation. We will also explore whether IPMK's PI3K activity affects cell migration by activating mTORC2 or
through an independent pathway. Furthermore, we will delve into how IPMK's PI3K activity influences the
organization of the actin cytoskeleton, a critical element in the process of cell migration. The following aims will
be explored to investigate the hypothesis: “IPMK is a novel PI3k essential for mTORC2 activation and cell
migration.” Specific Aim 1: Mechanism of IPMK-Mediated mTORC2 Activation. In this aim, we will elucidate
the molecular mechanism underlying IPMK-mediated mTORC2 activation. Specific Aim 2: Impact of
Phosphorylation on IPMK's PI3k Activity. We will identify the specific phosphorylation sites in IPMK necessary
for its PI3K activity and investigate how phosphorylation-deficient mutants of IPMK affect downstream functions
such as AKT activation, mTORC2 activation, and cell migration. Specific Aim 3: Regulation of Cell Migration
by IPMK and its PI3K Activity. This aim will assess how IPMK and its PI3K activity influence actin
polymerization, a crucial factor in cell migration. Mechanistically, we will determine whether IPMK-mediated cell
migration relies on mTORC2 or operates independently. By addressing these specific aims, we aim to shed light
on the intricate roles of IPMK's PI3K activity in mTORC2 activation and cell migration, contributing to our
understanding of this novel pathway and its potential implications."

People with disabilities – especially deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals – continue to be underrepresented in
STEM graduate programs, health science professions, and research settings. The need to promote disability
inclusion in the scientific workforce is a recognized priority of both the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The high attrition rates of deaf undergraduate STEM majors, with an
average of 83% dropping out of their programs before completion, are largely due to unwelcoming research
environments, inadequate access services, and ill-equipped mentors. To address this issue, the University of
Rochester James P. Wilmot Cancer Institute (Wilmot) proposes the Future Deaf Scientists (FDS) program.
This mentored research training initiative is based on a very successful summer internship program forged
through a partnership between Wilmot and the Rochester School for the Deaf (RSD), a bilingual deaf
education institution established in 1876, where instruction is delivered in American Sign Language and
English. The program aims to increase deaf students' participation in cancer research fields and improve the
STEM mentoring environment for young deaf scientists. The FDS program includes cultural competency
training for mentors and American Sign Language interpreter training for advanced STEM content. The FDS
program seeks to formalize a linguistically and culturally appropriate STEM and cancer research curriculum
tailored to deaf high school students that can also be used by schools nationwide. The FDS program applies
an innovative and tailored approach that provides the necessary first step in growing the Deaf Scientist
Training pipeline in Rochester, NY, and promoting cancer STEM efforts nationwide. Ultimately, participating
Deaf students will learn skills and confidence that will empower them to succeed in postsecondary education
and STEM/cancer research careers."

The overall vision of the proposed project is to to develop and deploy an affordable automated point-of-care
(POC) telecytology platform for oral cancer screening that will reliably establish a diagnosis of oral cancer in the
community setting and establish an immediate referral care pathway. Oral cancer is a significant public health
problem in India; 77,000 new cases and 52,000 deaths are reported annually, which is approximately one-fourth
of global incidences. Approximately 70% of cases present at an advanced stage, when the probability of cure is
very low, and a five-year survival rate is around 20%. It has been estimated that early diagnosis, with timely and
proper treatment, could improve the survival rate up to 90%. The current ‘gold standard’ of oral cancer screening
is visual inspection of the mouth by trained individuals, followed by biopsy of suspicious lesions. However, in
India there is a delay of nine months from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis. Of this, seven months are
attributed to the delays within the medical pathway The majority of the population lives in a rural environment,
where access to pathology services and expertise is very limited. Without definitive proof of cancer, patients are
not eligible for state-run insurance programs for treatment. Our proposed approach comprises a portable system
for scanning brush biopsy cytology slides with cloud connectivity for transmission of images to pathologists
and/or automated diagnosis via a validated algorithm for identification of atypical cells. After standard visual
triaging of patients during routine screening, those identified with higher risk lesions will immediately be
directed to undergo brush biopsies on the same day. Samples will be placed on a glass slide, stained with routine
toluidine blue (average time is <4 minutes), and imaged using the portable slide scanner. Initially these images
will be relayed via cloud to a remote pathologist who will immediately report them, while subsequent versions of
the prototype will have in-built artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for automated reporting in the field. We
believe that this innovative and affordable workflow would successfully expedite diagnosis and provide
significantly earlier treatment for oral cancer patients."
10937615,"Our objective is to use novel mobile health (mHealth) behavioral intervention approaches to enable patients
who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) to effectively cope with their symptoms to
improve their ability to engage in physical activity that can improve physical disability. In a NCI R21 study, we
developed a hybrid in-person and mHealth Coping Skills Training for Symptom Management and Daily Steps
(Step Up) intervention protocol, including mobile app. Step Up provides HCT patients with cognitive behavioral
coping skills training and occupational therapy (OT)-led activity coaching sessions to enhance their ability to
cope with symptoms – fatigue, pain, distress – that interfere with physical activity. Step Up has been developed
by experts in symptom management, members of the HCT medical team, and with extensive input from HCT
patients. Our R21 results show Step Up is feasible, acceptable to patients, and demonstrates a strong signal
for intervention benefits, including improvements in physical disability, symptoms, and activity (daily steps).
The next step in this research program is to use a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of Step
Up compared to Usual Care Plus (UC+). Step Up includes one in-person symptoms coping skills session and
two activity coaching sessions during intensive outpatient care. Then, following discharge home, an additional
four integrated symptom coping and activity coaching sessions are delivered via videoconferencing. Step Up
includes a mobile app and activity trackers (Fitbits) to capture daily symptom, activity, and biometric data
allowing the study team to provide real-time personalized feedback. Our central hypothesis is Step Up will lead
to improvements in physical disability (primary outcome), as well as secondary outcomes of symptom severity,
physical activity, and digital biomarkers reflective of symptom burden following HCT. A RCT (N=177) will be
used to pursue three specific aims: 1) Test the efficacy of Step Up for improving physical disability, as well as
symptom severity, physical activity, and self-efficacy for symptom management compared to UC+; 2) Examine
the relationship between symptoms and activity; and 3) Test the efficacy of Step Up for improving digital
biomarkers reflective of symptom burden (heart rate, activity, sleep time) measured via Fitbits. The proposed
work is innovative and impactful for HCT patients as it addresses interfering symptoms, integrates evidence-
based coping skills training with OT sessions to increase activity while decreasing symptoms that interfere with
activity, and uses mHealth technology for personalized real-time feedback to patients. Positive results would
provide the first demonstration of efficacy of a hybrid-delivered cognitive behavioral coping skills training and
activity coaching intervention that reduces physical disability by concurrently and synergistically decreasing
symptom burden and increasing activity. The proposed research has the potential to produce significant public
health benefit by redesigning existing modes of behavioral intervention delivery, improving continuity and
coordination of care, and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes."
10937130,"Abstract:
 Tamoxifen is the oldest and the most widely used selective estrogen receptor modulators. Fulvestrant is a
selective estrogen receptor down-regulator which blocks and damages estrogen receptors. Fulvestrant is
introduced to clinical as second-line therapy post disease progression after tamoxifen. Endocrine treatment is
the first-line therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer patients. However, 30%-50% of the breast
cancer patients with five to ten years of treatment acquire resistance to endocrine therapy. Resistance to
endocrine therapy and recurrence is the leading cause of mortality in breast cancer patients. Prolyl hydroxylation
(P4H), is an enzyme hydroxylates proline into 4-hydroxyproline of collagens and other proteins with the -X-Pro-
Gly- sequences as collagens in the endoplasmic reticulum. P4HA1, the alpha subunit of P4H1, is responsible
for both peptide binding and catalytic activity. In this study, we found that increased expression of P4HA1 was
detected in endocrine therapy resistant luminal breast cancer cells compared with endocrine therapy sensitive
cells. High P4HA1 expression significantly correlates with short relapse-free survival in luminal breast cancer
patients. Inactivation of P4HA1 protein sensitized endocrine resistance luminal cancer cells to 4-
Hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) or fulvestrant treatment, accompanied by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. These preliminary data indicate that P4HA1 is an important regulator for
endocrine resistance of breast cancer. We hypothesize that inhibition of P4HA1 sensitizes luminal breast cancer
cells to endocrine therapy by inducing ROS-ER stress pathway. To investigate the importance of P4HA1 for
endocrine resistance, we will introduce P4HA1 protein expression in endocrine sensitive luminal breast cancer
cell lines. We will examine resistance to 4OHT or fulvestrant treatment, ER stress level, as well as ROS levels
in P4HA1-overexpression cells under 4OHT or fulvestrant treatment. We will perform rescue experiments in
P4HA-silenced endocrine resistant cells using ROS inhibitor. For the in vivo study, we will use endocrine resistant
luminal breast cancer cell lines orthotropic xenograft model, and resistance luminal breast cancer patient-
derived-xenograft (PDX) models. We will determine whether inactivation of P4HA1 renders these endocrine
resistant tumors sensitive to tamoxifen or fulvestrant treatment in vivo, and examine whether the overwhelmed
ER stress and ROS levels are associated with endocrine sensitivity in tumors. In summary, this investigation will
uncover a novel uncanonical role of P4HA1 in endocrine resistance by regulation ROS-ER stress pathway, and
explore P4HA1 as a novel therapeutic target for combinatorial therapy for endocrine resistant luminal breast
cancer patients."
10921818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac arrest (CA) is a life-threatening condition that can lead to loss of pulse, cessation of breathing, and
unconsciousness. In the US alone, over 805,000 people are affected annually by CA, with the average
survival rate being as low as 10.4%. CA is usually caused by reduced blood flow and ineffective cardiac
output, which can result in post-cardiac arrest brain injury if not treated promptly. To improve clinical
outcomes and survival rates, it's crucial to restore effective blood flow as soon as possible while minimizing
the risk of reperfusion injury. Currently used resuscitation fluids are not effective in increasing blood pressure
and may even contribute to further injury. Therefore, there is an urgent need for efficient interventions to
improve coronary artery perfusion pressure and reduce reperfusion injury to minimize organ damage and
ensure better survival of patients.
Vivacelle Bio Inc. has developed a proprietary formulation called VBI-1, which is composed of micelles and
liposomes. It acts as a colloidal volume expander, absorbs excessive nitric oxide and free radicals, and
carries and releases oxygen. This formulation is specifically designed to address cardiac ischemia
reperfusion injury. In a previous study using a rat model of cardiac arrest and clinical death due to rapid and
severe blood loss, we demonstrated that VBI-1 infusion via the femoral artery was superior to all other fluids,
including shed blood, in restoring spontaneous respiration and elevating blood pressure 4 hours after
infusion. Our goal is to expand the use of intra-arterial infusion of VBI-1 to more common causes of cardiac
arrest.
In Phase II, Vivacelle Bio will perform Further preclinical validation, including biodistribution and bioavailability
studies leading to IND application. Optimization of VBI-1 will be guided by studies of its mechanism or that
of a modified form of VBI-1."
10922080,"ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapies produce remarkable, long-term responses in subsets of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer, but unfortunately, most patients do not respond to such treatment. Current biomarkers to predict which
patients will benefit have limited accuracy, and decisions to continue or suspend treatment are mainly guided by
monitoring of radiographic changes in tumor size. However, unusual immune-related response patterns such
as pseudo-progression, mixed response, and delayed response can make scans difficult to interpret. Circulating
tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a highly promising biomarker for monitoring immunotherapy efficacy.
Several studies involving various immunotherapy agents and multiple types of cancer have demonstrated that
early reduction in ctDNA levels during treatment are predictive of tumor response and improved survival
outcomes. However, existing technologies that measure ctDNA by probing for common somatic mutations will
fail in patients whose tumors lack these mutations. This limitation is being addressed by creating customized
assays based on patient-specific tumor mutation profiles; but this approach is complex, expensive, and slow.
We have developed a ctDNA assay technology based on detection of epigenetic features that are found in
virtually all cancer cell genomes. Our Phase I data indicate that our approach has broad patient coverage and
can be applied to multiple types of cancer without requiring tumor profiling and assay customization. In this
Phase II project, we aim to build data to support the clinical utility of our assay technology for monitoring of lung
cancer immunotherapy response. We also aim to advance our current research-mode assay to rigorous clinical-
grade testing standards for use in clinical practice."

Developmental Disabilities to Independently Use Driverless and Driver Supported Ridehailing Services
 Project Summary/Abstract
It is a well-documented fact that people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), continue to
experience great disparities in access to transportation resources. The emergence of ridesharing services such
as Uber, Lyft, and future driverless vehicles are only increasing these transportation disparities:
 Thirty years after the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with disabilities still face
 significant barriers to transportation access. In recent years, new transportation services known as “new
 mobility,” or “emerging mobility” launched entirely without accessible options. These services include
 transportation network companies (TNCs) such as Lyft and Uber, bike share, scooter share, and car
 share…disabled people in San Francisco see promise in some new mobility services but currently face
 significant barriers to use. Out of all new mobility options, respondents were most interested in on-
 demand automobile access, e.g., accessible TNCs or accessible taxis. (Ruvolo, 2021)
The available research specifically on transportation and intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) is
limited but still illustrative of the significant transportation disparities they face, due largely to their functional
limitations in the very areas that public transit most often requires (Friedman and Rizzolo, 2016). As a result,
people with IDD are disproportionally dependent on paratransit services which are very costly to provide,
require 24 hours or longer notice, are limited in range, are not integrated with the general population, and are
very costly to provide. The impact of these disparities in transportation access affects virtually all areas of
community life. The development of ride sharing services provided by TNCs have expanded options for many
people with and without disabilities, but this adoption has largely left out the population of individuals with IDD.
This project proposes development and evaluation of a universally designed app and web-based tools to
support independent access to ridesharing services by individuals with IDD, including driverless vehicles. The
WayFinder Rideshare system will benefit from previous peer-reviewed research and will address the safety
and security concerns that have historically limited this population’s use of transportation options. The system
will use a Smart Trip List approach to support pre-population of all aspects of requesting and taking a specific
ridesharing trip, such that the end user only need to tap a picture of a desired destination and confirm the
selection via audio, image, and text presentation. Safety features will include adaptation of AbleLink’s remote
tracking system and emergency help features, along with other supports identified during the requirements
development process. Phase I will conclude with an accessibility and usability study of the prototype as
compared to Uber and Lyft rideshare apps, and Phase II will include a full implementation field study to
determine efficacy and improvements."
10921604,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 CFD Research Corporation has developed a novel microbiome-balancing wet wrap therapy for atopic
dermatitis based on a natural compound with unique physicochemical and pharmacological activities. The
compound has been found to have an interleukin-based immune modulatory effect that helps soothe the flare-
up of eczema, and it is highly selective to the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus while being gentle to the skin
microbiome, including beneficial bacteria such as Roseomonas mucosa and Corynebacterium
tuberculostearicum.
 The compound was incorporated into cellulose-based fabrics such as rayon and cotton to create a
controlled-release wet wrap/bandage which will be tested on mouse models of eczema. The technology has the
potential become a standard of care for treating eczema patients and decrease or eliminate the use of steroid
ointments in controlling atopic dermatitis in children and adult populations."
10921693,"The overarching goal of my research program is to understand tissue specific immunity with focus on the lungs.
Immune cells continuously surveil the lungs to respond quickly to infections. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
causes chronic tuberculosis (TB) and Francisella tularensis causes acute tularemia—two bacteria that cause
respiratory infectious diseases. I have developed two large-scale T cell epitope discovery programs that leverage
our strengths and my forte: the Merit supports the Mtb program; and AI137982 “Molecular Basis of CD1D and
Natural Killer T Cell Function”, awarded in August 2019, after the RCS began, supports F. tularensis research.
New support has been sought via a response to an RFA BAA-NIAID-DAIT-75N93022R00023: “FUNCTIONAL
IMMUNOPEPTIDOMICS: Large-Scale F tularensis-derived Epitope Discovery & Correlates of T Cell Immunity”.
 Our Mtb work addresses a critical unmet need for an effective vaccine against TB that will significantly
improve the quality of life of our Veterans. Mtb lives and multiplies within the host immune cell called
macrophages, which are voracious eaters of bacteria and other foreign substances. Mtb has evolved ways to
prevent macrophages from doing so, making life within infected cells possible. To get rid of the infection, the
host needs to engage the killer cells of the immune system, one such killer cell is called CD8+ T cell. CD8+ T
cells are equipped to find infected cells in very specific manner when antigens are presented in association with
the hosts’ Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-I molecule. HLA-I are different between individuals making T cell
vaccine development difficult. Fortunately, HLA-I can be grouped into nine supertypes—B7 is one such
supertype expressed by 40—45% of the human population. Once specific antigen recognition occurs, these
effector cells deploy killing mechanisms to destroy the infected cells, leaving no place for the bacteria to live.
 Hence, the overarching goal of the Merit research is to develop a vaccine platform against TB that harnesses
CD8+ T cell functions. This program leverages 30+ years of my experience in the field of antigen processing and
presentation to T cells. Thus, in a systematic approach to vaccine design, our work involves pre-clinical studies
that aims to identify MTb-derived antigens expressed only by infected macrophages so that CD8+ T cells can
recognize such antigens, kill infected cells, and, thereby, confer protection to the host. In addition to vaccine
design, our research will develop platforms for the delivery of next generation TB vaccines directly to the site of
Mtb infection which is the lungs. We have made great strides toward both these goals: To facilitate the antigen
discovery goal, we have developed new HLA-I transgenic humanized mouse lines. Then in a high-throughput
antigen presentation assay that leverages a novel ultrahigh-density peptide arrays, we discovered 100s of
peptide antigens that are presented by four common human MHC molecules. By bioinformatics approach we
have winnowed down to 35 most likely MTb antigens recognized by CD8+ T cells, of which several are
immunogenic Mtb-derived peptides and presented by members of the B7 supertype. Candidate antigens in these
novel humanized mouse models are at the centre of the current investigations. Toward the development of
platforms for vaccine delivery to the lungs—we have designed and validated nanoparticle platforms adjuvanted
with three different chemicals that activate the innate immune system. The unique feature of these platforms is
the ability to target the nanoparticle to the cytosol of a host immune cell called dendritic cell (DC), which are
critical for antigen presentation to CD8+ T cells. We will harness this delivery platform to deliver the antigen/s
discovered in the discovery phase of the project summarized above, tether the nanoparticle with an adjuvant to
activate DCs, for delivery to the lungs. In summary, this pre-clinical, translational project is on an upward
trajectory and will validate the ‘discover & deliver’ platform for a vaccine against TB. Success with this project
brings with it the promise of delivering better health care to our Veterans, especially the downtrodden amongst
them and, hence, the most burdened by the scourge of tuberculosis."
10937903,"Perceived social isolation—commonly known as loneliness—is a psychosocial stressor that is associated with
increased mortality, opioid use, and precipitants of relapse among individuals with opioid use disorders (OUD).
Despite its association with greater clinical severity among individuals with OUD, there are no efficacy trials of
perceived social isolation interventions among individuals with OUD. Importantly, there are effective
interventions that can decrease perceived social isolation; however, there are no fully-powered efficacy trials
that have directly intervened on perceived social isolation among individuals with OUD. Cognitive-Behavioral
Therapy for Perceived Social Isolation (CBT-PSI) addresses negative beliefs that perpetuate perceived social
isolation, increase negative affect, and reduce one’s ability to engage in social activities. For an individual with
OUD, this is critical as addressing cognitive biases, negative affect, and having a sense that one has and
engages social support are key aspects of recovery. The proposed R01 tests the efficacy of this brief,
telehealth-delivered, evidence-based intervention, CBT-PSI, to decrease perceived social isolation Participants
will be recruited nationally and will be randomized to either (a) therapist-delivered CBT-PSI, (b) therapist-
delivered Health Education, or (c) self-guided Health Education. Each intervention will occur across 6 sessions
delivered/administered on a weekly basis. The specific aims are to: (1) assess group differences in perceived
social isolation among individuals with OUD, (2) assess group differences in opioid use among individuals with
OUD, and (3) assess the reciprocal relationship between opioid use and perceived social isolation. Additional
outcomes of interest include mental health symptoms, and the quality and quantity of social interactions.
Outcomes will be assessed post-treatment, 1-month post-treatment, 3-months post-treatment, and 6-months
post-treatment. This project has the potential of having a significant public health impact by evaluating an
intervention on a novel therapeutic target for OUD, perceived social isolation. Elucidation of the efficacy of
CBT-PSI can help advance prevention and augment existing treatment strategies for OUD."
10937148,"Obesity directly contributes to comorbid diseases which account for the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in much of the world. Although functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) was only recently shown to be present in adult humans, studies in animal models and humans over the past fifteen years have shown that BAT can convey remarkable protection against obesity, type 2 diabetes, and associated disorders. However, we still have a very limited understanding of how BAT function in humans is regulated, and its genetic underpinnings have yet to be studied. At present there is no reliable biomarker or widely accessible diagnostic test to measure BAT function, necessitating creative approaches to study its genetic regulation. This proposal employs innovative strategies to leverage data from unique human cohorts to discover genetic variants explaining BAT function and linking BAT to metabolic traits and susceptibility to disease. We will utilize two complementary approaches: (1) Identify functional genetic variants in individuals with exceptionally high BAT activity and then cross-reference candidates with data from large human cohorts to ascertain whether these variants are associated with cardiometabolic phenotypes, and (2) Identify predicted functional variants in genes important for BAT function and perform phenome wide association study (PheWAS) and quantitative trait analyses focused on cardiometabolic traits. High confidence candidate variants identified through these approaches will then be investigated functionally in human brown adipocytes. This bedside-bench approach has the potential to provide a fundamentally new understanding of human BAT biology, a valuable new resource for the field, and to identify new mechanism-based targets for obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic diseases."
10937542,"The proposed project uses behavioral and neurophysiological experiments in an animal model to explore
mechanisms underlying the “modulation filterbank” of human perceptual studies. Envelope fluctuations, called
amplitude modulation (AM), are a critical acoustic feature of sound necessary for robust speech perception.
Human listeners show diminished AM sensitivity in competing envelope fluctuations of similar frequency,
known as modulation masking. Modulation masking is not explainable by classic power-spectrum models, but
instead indicates a “modulation filterbank” processing strategy that separates concurrent sounds (e.g., AM
targets from noise) that have different AM frequencies. The modulation filterbank is an exciting theoretical
advancement because in addition to explaining modulation masking, the model can predict differences in
speech-in-noise perception across fluctuating and multi-talker noise sources. Physiological mechanisms of the
modulation filterbank are crucial to understand given high relevance to real-world hearing, but remain poorly
understood due in part to limited development of animal models. The proposed research will significantly
advance our knowledge of the modulation filterbank through operant-conditioning experiments and neural
recordings in actively behaving budgerigars. Budgerigars, a parakeet species, are selected based on prior
studies showing human-like behavioral sensitivity to many simple and complex sounds. Furthermore,
budgerigars and other birds show largely conserved auditory processing mechanisms with mammals from the
auditory nerve to the forebrain processing level. Aim 1 establishes the budgerigar as a new animal model of
the modulation filterbank using behavioral modulation-masking experiments conducted with operant-
conditioning procedures. Preliminary results demonstrate first-ever evidence of the perceptual modulation
filterbank in a nonhuman species. Aim 2 quantifies neural mechanisms of modulation-masked behavioral AM
sensitivity using extracellular neural recordings from the midbrain and forebrain in behaving animals.
Preliminary results support the hypothesis that midbrain average-rate responses explain behavioral band-pass
modulation masking, the hallmark of the modulation filterbank, at mid-to-high target AM frequencies.
Recordings are made at two processing levels to assess transformation of the modulation filterbank code along
the ascending pathway. Aim 3 extends our analysis of the modulation filterbank concept to a real-world
listening task in fluctuating noise using “comodulation masking release” (CMR) experiments. CMR is the
improvement of tone-in-noise sensitivity observed in fluctuating noise, selected based on recent theoretical
studies implicating the modulation filterbank as a key potential mechanism. Aim 3 experiments empirically test
a modulation-filterbank mechanism for CMR using behavioral and neurophysiological experiments for the first
time in the same species. The proposed project significantly advances our understanding of the modulation
filterbank and the role of this exciting model for real-world hearing in noise."

Surveillance of drug-resistant bacteria in resource-limited settings: a focus on cost-
effective long-read sequencing of eyedrop-associated P. aeruginosa and locally sourced metagenomic
samples
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to global public health, rendering antibiotics
increasingly ineffective against drug-resistant bacteria. Recent episodes involving the contamination of
preservative-free eyedrops with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa have resulted in
hundreds of infection cases and three fatalities. This outbreak underscores that superbug occurrences are no
longer confined to healthcare-associated settings, and we need a community-wide surveillance system that
monitors local infection outbreaks efficiently in terms of time, accuracy, and cost. Such a system is essential to
mitigate the adverse consequences of superbugs, encompassing a broad spectrum of sample types including
medicinal and agricultural products. To achieve this long-term goal, this project first aims to test a
decentralized AMR surveillance system in resource-limited settings by assessing the detection of drug-
resistant bacteria and antimicrobial bacteriophages with cost-efficient long-read sequencing. We will use
Flongle platforms that enable the sequencing of smaller assays (<$100 per run) to sequence the eyedrop-
associated samples to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of XDR P. aeruginosa and bacteriophage genome
assembly. Through our collaborative efforts with the research team at UCSD (David Pride, Ph.D./M.D.), we
have the necessary data and expertise to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of our
approach in contrast to their conventional sequencing methods. Next, we will conduct an exploratory study
involving the sequencing of locally sourced metagenomic samples from the farm units of CSU Fresno. This
exploratory study leverages the quantitative assessment of the low-cost AMR surveillance pipeline in the
previous aim to obtain metagenomic data that can reveal the extent of AMR presence within the Central Valley
region of Fresno with heavy agricultural activities and discover novel bacteria/phage pairs for future
biotherapeutic applications. The broader implication of this project extends to the empowerment of resource-
constraint institutes as proactive agents in the surveillance and investigation of antimicrobial resistance. By
monitoring local infection outbreaks throughout diverse segments of society, including underserved
communities, these institutes can effectively contribute to the rapid and efficient control and prevention of local
infection outbreaks, thereby bolstering public health on a broader scale."
10937257,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Older persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) often use potentially inappropriate
medications (PIMs) - medications with a risk of harm or that are unlikely to be beneficial. The use of PIMs
leads to accelerated functional decline, hospitalization, institutionalization, and death, yet it is difficult to
appropriately deprescribe (discontinue/reduce) these medications, especially during the post-acute care
transitions when PIM use is common and has substantial consequences. Current research in deprescribing for
persons with ADRD has focused on long-term care, with a critical gap in our understanding of deprescribing in
routine clinical practice for community-dwelling older adults with ADRD during care transitions. In this study, we
focus on home health care (HHC) - a logical setting to address PIM use and deprescribing in persons with
ADRD during post-acute care transitions due to its existing care processes, clinician workforce, and resources
that can serve as a foundation to deprescribing of PIMs. This 5-year project includes two aims. Aim 1 is to
identify the factors associated with, and novel barriers/facilitators in, routine practice PIM deprescribing among
persons with ADRD in HHC. We will use a sequential mixed methods approach, including analysis of existing
data in national administrative service datasets and qualitative stakeholder engagement through group concept
mapping. Then, we will integrate and synthesize the results from quantitative data analysis and qualitative
stakeholder engagement to further develop a deprescribing intervention in HHC for older adults with ADRD
and caregivers. Aim 2 is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of the intervention in a one-
group pre-post clinical trial. This proposal is aligned with NIA’s strategic priorities to develop innovative
interventions to target multimorbidity and its associated geriatric syndromes (e.g., polypharmacy), and to
support older persons with ADRD through care and services provided at home and in the community. Findings
will form the basis for a subsequent R01 that will examine the effects of the developed deprescribing
intervention on medication and clinical outcomes of older HHC patients with ADRD. The candidate, Dr. Jinjiao
Wang, Ph.D., RN, is a registered nurse with experience in HHC and an assistant professor at the University of
Rochester (UR) School of Nursing. The long-term goal of Dr. Wang is to become a leading geriatrics health
services researcher in home-based geriatric care with a focus on medication safety and optimization. Under a
multidisciplinary team of exemplary mentors from medicine, psychiatry, psychology, nursing, and gerontology,
and clinical pharmacy, Dr. Wang will build on her preliminary work on polypharmacy management in HHC to
accomplish training goals in ADRD care, mixed methods approach, design and conduct of clinical trials,
particularly with persons with ADRD and their caregivers, and leadership development. UR provides an
exceptional environment for the completion of the proposed research and for Dr. Wang, who has already
begun to emerge as a leading researcher in the field of home-based geriatric care and deprescribing."

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has attracted considerable interest in the cognitive neuroscience
community, providing an important basic research tool to study brain function, with emerging clinical applications
to enhance function in individuals with neurological disorders. Despite this potential, an emerging literature has
highlighted concerns regarding the reliability and robustness of transcranial electric stimulation (tES), the primary
NIBS method used to induce changes in brain plasticity through the application of subthreshold stimulation.
These problems are likely related to the fact that tES systems can only induce modest electrical fields (E-field)
at the cortical surface given that safety/tolerance issues limit the intensity of tES stimulation that can be delivered
at the scalp. We developed a radically new NIBS approach, one in which subthreshold modulation of neural
excitability is brought about via oscillating magnetic fields at kHZ frequencies. This system, referred to kTMP
(kHz Transcranial Magnetic Perturbation) significantly increases the range of subthreshold E-field induction, and
through modulation of the envelope of the kHz carrier frequency, can impose E-fields at physiological relevant
frequencies. The three-year funding period will be used to conduct testing with human participants to assess the
tolerability and efficacy of the system in producing changes in cortical physiology and behavior. If our
expectations are confirmed, this system will introduce a powerful new method for modulating neural excitability
and as such, provide clinicians with a promising new intervention in the treatment of neurological disorders."

10911666,"ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy (RT) is a curative treatment, used adjuvant to surgery and chemotherapy in over 60% of
cancers. It is delivered to nearly 1 out of every 6 people at some point in their lifetime. External beam treatment
is commonly fractionated (i.e., delivered in 25-40 daily fractions), although there is a trend towards
hypofractionation (5-10 days) with higher doses per fraction. While RT is generally considered safe and effective,
it is well known that minor deviations in treatment happen on a daily basis in a busy treatment facility, and these
changes are prone to higher human error rates. Major potential side effects can occur if not administered with
high daily accuracy, and the precision needed is at the millimeter level in patient and beam alignment, in order
to keep normal tissue doses sufficiently low. However, there is a proven 1-5% incidence of secondary cancer
from this treatment. This is particularly relevant in whole breast radiotherapy, where even 2% target dose delivery
(1Gy) to part of the contralateral breast has been proven to lead to a high probability for a secondary cancer. In
reality, no clinic actually knows their true incident rate, because no system exists to visualize every treatment as
part of routine clinical practice. DoseOptics’ invention of Cherenkov imaging, branded as BeamSite™, provides
time-gated single photon video rate imaging of the light coming off tissue during the radiation dose delivery as it
happens. The parent Phase II grant for this proposal, funded development of Cherenkov imaging with the
VisionRT surface guided radiotherapy system (SGRT) system. Together the combined system has been
trademarked as DoseRTTM, where the Cherenkov video of dose delivery is displayed in the same window monitor
as the SGRT metrics of patient position. This combined interface provides a complete intuitive package for the
therapists, where daily assessment and corrections can be made as needed. VisionRT and DoseOptics have a
signed a long-term partnership and license and finance agreement. In this Phase IIB application, key
improvements are implemented from test use, to make DoseRT more commercially viable for widespread
deployment across different vendor platforms, more easily used by various therapy teams, and with some
customization approaches for each center. The project is based upon previous NIH supported hardware that is
now FDA 510(k) cleared. Aims 1 & 2 advance strategic updates to hardware and software systems for which
improve cost structure and robustness, improving commercial viability of the system. This updated system will
also be 510(k) cleared in Aim 3 with beta deployment. The project will culminate in Aim 4 with broader
deployment and testing validation with an image registry. This clinical registry data will be used to validate
marketing claims around incident detection and improved radiotherapy delivery by visualization of the beam on
the patient. The team involved encompasses the two companies with expertise across all areas of development,
as well as a number of clinical partner sites. The company has secured third-party investment for the Phase IIB
matching funds. This project will complete commercialization readiness of DoseRT for a customer-ready solution."
10934704,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains a fatal diagnosis despite available therapies. PAH is
characterized by extensive remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature involving the formation of vaso-occlusive
lesions and a thickened medial layer of the vascular wall, both of which contain pulmonary arterial smooth muscle
cells (PASMCs). It has been demonstrated that PASMCs isolated from a well-established rat model of PAH are
resistant to apoptosis under both basal and stimulated conditions. The cell membrane protein aquaporin 1
(AQP1) was initially described as a water transport channel, but more recently has been implicated in other
cellular functions including migration and proliferation, and in several distinct cancer types, has been associated
with apoptosis resistance. AQP1 is upregulated in PASMCs isolated from rat models of PAH suggesting a ‘quasi-
malignant’ disease model, although AQP1’s exact role in apoptosis resistance is unclear. Exciting new data from
an unpublished proteomics study using lung lysates demonstrates that AQP1 immunoprecipitates with total
caspase-3, a enzymatic protein activated in apoptosis which is translocated to the nucleus where it initiates cell
death. In proximity studies utilizing biotin ligase techniques, I have demonstrated that AQP1 and total caspase-
3 come within close proximity in live cells. Furthermore, in silico analysis of the AQP1 protein reveals 3 potential
caspase-3 cleavage sites, which provide a mechanism for this protein-protein interaction. Together, these data
suggest that AQP1 interacts with caspase-3, providing a novel relationship between AQP1, the caspase
cascade, and resistance to apoptosis. This application serves to provide a training vehicle as I explore a potential
mechanism by which AQP1 regulates apoptosis during PAH. Aim 1 is designed to determine whether the
cytosolic caspase-3 cleavage site(s) on AQP1 are necessary for AQP1/caspase-3 interaction, Aim 2 serves to
evaluate the impact of AQP1 on nuclear localization of capsase-3, and finally Aim 3 will establish if increased
AQP1 is necessary and/or sufficient to confer apoptosis resistance. Techniques utilized to address these aims
include but are not limited to protein expression and site directed mutagenesis, biotin ligase proximity assays,
co-immunoprecipitation, animal models of PAH and primary cell isolation, immunofluorescence and confocal
microscopy, nuclear/cytosolic fractionation, luminescent caspase-3/7 activity assay, Hoechst staining and
TUNEL staining. Completion of this project will provide novel insight into the interaction between AQP1 and
caspase-3 and the role for AQP1 in apoptosis resistance as well as provide a novel pathway for new therapeutic
targets. The skills obtained in the design and execution of this study and the experimental results will provide
the necessary foundation for a K award and an excellent platform on which to start a career as an independently
funded clinician scientist focused on PAH. Insights gained from this work also could have implications beyond
PAH to any diagnosis in which cellular resistance to apoptosis is essential to the development of disease."
10934708,"OVERALL COMPONENT PROJECT SUMMARY
Research on Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) has identified
several promising risk factors which could guide strategies to prevent up to 40% of AD/ADRD. Nearly all prior
evidence relies on observational data, which is prone to biases from unmeasured confounding, reverse
causation, selective survival, and measurement error. The Triangulation of Innovative Methods to End AD
(TIME-AD) program addresses these challenges by using an evidence triangulation framework for
strengthening causal inference in observational data. This framework systematically evaluates biases, planning
complementary analysis approaches with different data sources and study designs to rule out alternative
interpretations for the association of each risk factor and AD/ADRD: a) doubly robust observational methods
combining propensity score models with outcome models; b) instrumental variables (IV) methods using genetic
and policy variations that introduce random variation in exposure; and c) quantitative bias analysis to
characterize uncertainty. Project 1 will address the effects of alcohol use across the lifecourse on cognitive
aging and AD/ADRD risk. Project 2 will evaluate the effects of depression and depression treatment on
AD/ADRD risk and possible direct and modifying roles of chronic pain. Project 3 will assess whether
AD/ADRD risk may be reduced by prevention or treatment of vision or hearing impairments. Project 4 will
assess the impacts of social isolation, focusing on components of social isolation that are modifiable with
existing interventions. Each of these exposures is known to be associated with AD/ADRD outcomes in highly
educated, predominantly White populations; the current proposals will extend our knowledge by focusing on
causation, including large, diverse samples, and rigorously evaluating heterogeneity across populations. In
addition to an Administrative Core, projects will be supported by a Cognitive Outcomes, Exposure
Variables, and Covariates Data Core, which will help the intensive data management involved in constructing
analytic data sets and foster harmonized measures and coordinated analyses, drawing on multiple data
sources to support evidence triangulation. A Genetic and Policy Data Core will bring specialized expertise on
genetics, policies, and IV analysis, providing code to construct, validate, and implement IV analyses. An
Analytics Core will develop and share reusable analytic code and support implementation of the most up-to-
date methodology; and an Equity and Dissemination Core will ensure an equity focus is maintained
throughout TIME-AD, maximizing the relevance of our findings to improve outcomes among populations
typically underrepresented in AD/ADRD research. The Equity and Dissemination Core will ensure that
research implementation is guided by potential applications of the evidence and that the findings of each study
are broadly disseminated to stakeholders who can act on the evidence. The synergies created by shared cores
with expertise in data, analysis, and equity and dissemination ensure that TIME-AD will have high impact."

Fundamental to advancing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of hepatobiliary cancer (HBC) is the
engagement and focus of dedicated researchers. The central activities of the Career Enhancement Program
(CEP) in the NCI-supported Mayo Clinic SPORE in HBC meets this fundamental need by identifying, developing,
and monitoring the progress of the most promising investigators for translational research in liver and biliary
cancer. The CEP has demonstrated a strong track record of supporting applicants from two targeted groups: 1)
early-stage investigators and 2) mid-career investigators who previously have not engaged in HBC research.
The support includes financial ($100k/year) and extensive mentorship. This comprehensive program ultimately
will create an interdisciplinary network of researchers committed to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
individuals with this disease. Awards are used to support studies of 1-year duration, with a requirement that
adequate need or progress is demonstrated for a second year of funding. In the ongoing funding period (Years
1-4), the CEP selected 7 investigators for 10 awards (3 awardees received a second year of funding). These
diverse investigators included women (2/7) and individuals from underrepresented ethnic groups (3/7). All remain
active translational investigators in the field of liver and biliary cancer. Five of the 7 awardees remain involved
with the HBC SPORE, while 2 awardees now are successful investigators in HBC research at other institutions.
A former CEP awardee is serving as a Co-Investigator of a full translational project in this renewal application.
To date, the CEP has resulted in significant successful scientific collaborations and additional funding, including
3 K-Awards and 1 R01 in HBC research, with others still pending. The success of the current CEP provides a
template for expanding and enriching this program. The CEP leadership will continue to widely advertise the
availability of CEP awards and use a rigorous and transparent process to review and select applicant candidates
based on career potential to initiate, obtain funding for, and conduct translational research addressing the
morbidity and/or mortality of HBC. Going forward, the CEP proposes to build on this success by 1) extending
recruitment to a broader pool of candidates and increasing the scope of activities by involving past awardees in
the 2) selection, 3) evaluation, and 4) mentoring of new candidates, which will nurture collaboration and provide
critical experience for future SPORE leadership. The expectation will continue to be that successful CEP
proposals will replace full SPORE projects or be eligible for other sources of extramural funding. The CEP is a
key component of the Mayo Clinic SPORE in HBC, as it provides a significant mechanism for increasing the
number and diversity of scientists and clinical investigators who are committed to translational HBC research."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary goal of this application is to continue to harness the capabilities of the Center for Pediatric Research
to support basic and translational scientists studying mechanisms underlying children’s disease and associated
treatment options. The origin of many pediatric diseases is from altered developmental programming related to
the processes of cell proliferation, morphogenesis, migration, differentiation, and programmed death. These
developmental processes are at the root of pediatric disease and are disrupted through genetic disorders,
aberrant fetal programming, altered growth & development, and environmental pressures. Our multidisciplinary
Center applies genetic, biochemical, cell, and molecular approaches across several model organisms to
characterize alterations during development as they pertain to pediatric diseases and disorders. For Phase III
we will continue to build upon the success of Phase I and II efforts in creating a critical mass of independently
funded investigators within the Center for Pediatric Research by refining our focus to support and mentor both
new and established investigators. Center success will be achieved through the following Aims: 1) maintain a
supportive environment for the training and mentorship of scientists studying pediatric disease to strengthen and

10935671,"Role of stromal cell-activated CNOT6L deadenylase in driving AML transformation.
AML has long been thought to be exclusively driven by genetic or epigenetic mutations within HSCs. Besides
these classical mechanisms, the BM stromal microenvironment plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis,
maintenance and resistance to treatment of malignant clones. Using osteoblast-specific β-catenin models of
AML and MDS, and cells from MDS patients that progressed to AML, we have identified a transcriptional event
that is highly associated with MDS to AML transformation. Compared to MDS, AML cells show increased
expression of the deadenylase CNOT6L. CLOT6L expression is also upregulated in cells from AML versus MDS
patients in several cohorts, and additional mouse models of AML transformation. Overexpression of Cnot6l in
HSPCs of MDS mice induces AML evolution. Cnot6l-induced AML is passaged to secondary healthy recipients
Conversely, CNOT6L inactivation reverses AML transformation. In contrast to AML cells, CNOT6L expression
is downregulated in healthy myeloid progenitors as compared to HSCs of humans and mice and in
megakaryocyte progenitors of subjects with DNMT3AR882 CH. Notably, Cnot6l expression in HSCs is increased
upon chronic IL-1 treatment suggesting that it may also be part of the regenerative response that involves
emergency myelopoiesis (EM) and promotes clonal expansion with inflammation. Thus, maintaining low
CNOT6L mRNA levels may maintain myeloid lineage differentiation whereas increasing it may favor AML
transformation of ARCH or MDS. Indeed, CNOT6L expression is highly associated with AML founder mutations
in the TCGA database and with MDM4 expression. Our hypothesis is that stromal cell amplified CNOT6L-
mediated deadenylation can drive AML development from pre-AML states of MDS and in the context of aging-
related stress factors of ARCH and inflammatory stress in the marrow. We will determine the role of CNOT6L in
AML initiation with aging and age-related loss factors of ARCH and inflammatory stress with EM engagement;
determine how Cnot6l promotes clonal heterogeneity by defining and validating the mutational profile and
transcriptional targets/mechanisms of CNOT6L-related AML evolution using mouse modeling along with single
cell mutational and transcriptional sequencing to define clonal trajectory in mice and primary patient samples;
and, characterize stromal cell mechanisms that induce Cnot6l-dependent MDS to AML transformation using
primary patient samples and mouse models and scRNAseq and spatial mapping. These studies will identify
transcriptional and clonal events driven by the stroma that are significant contributors to AML transformation.
Early transformative events may be therapeutically targeted thus implementing a potentially more effective
therapy that is preventive rather than curative."

The Computational Genomics Core will provide a centralized structure to collect, analyzed and
integrate data from all three projects. Simultaneous genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic
mapping of bone marrow tissue will provide a unique opportunity to map cell types, their states
and pathway specific expression patterns in a spatially resolved manner. In addition to current
already implemented computational pipelines, the Core will develop new techniques that will be
applied across projects, implement methods for data integration and provide quantitative training
and computational support. The Core leaders (Drs. Rabadan and Wang) and their groups have
proven expertise in developing and successfully implementing mathematical and statistical
computational methods for large scale genomic analysis and data integration. Their work will be
integrated with that of Drs. Gaublomme and Greenblatt who have developed and are further
developing spatial mapping technologies to profile in situ cell states in the BM niche and delineate
their intercellular communication patterns. Datasets will be mined to chart the rewiring of both cell
states in the bone marrow niche and their aberrant signaling during AML transformation.
Additionally, Core B will include a partnership between quantitative and bench scientists that will
develop new techniques in addition to refining and implementing locally existing techniques
across all 3 projects. More specifically, the Core will: i) provide analysis of genomic data including
single cell mutational profiling through implementation of public pipelines, as well as through
internally developed approaches; ii) characterize cancer AML evolution from mutational profiling
data using Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) and the MissionBio Platform, including
refinement of clonal trajectory inference; iii) analyze single cell transcriptomic and chromatin data
and integrate approaches across projects; iv) implement and improve computational approaches
for systematic analysis of spatially resolved multi-omic data; v) integrate data across technologies
and projects, including the characterization of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic states."
10935865,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Project 1 is striving to understand the role of transcription factor NRF2 and the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose
bisphosphate phosphatase 1 (FBP1) in NASH to HCC progression. Advanced NASH is associated with
disruption of hepatocyte autophagy and accumulation of p62 within Mallory-Denk Bodies, which by sequestration
of KEAP1 activates NRF2. Although not tumorigenic on its own, NRF2 reprograms hepatocyte metabolism to
support HCC initiation. We also found FBP1, previously described as an HCC tumor suppressor, to negatively
regulate AKT activation independently of its enzymatic activity. Notably, NRF2 and FBP1 are engaged in a
regulatory “tug-of-war,” whereby NRF2 leads to activation of ERK1/2, which phosphorylate FBP1 and induce its
ubiquitylation and degradation, and by restraining AKT activation FBP1 enhances GSK3-induced NRF2
degradation. These novel cross-regulatory interactions play a major role in NASH to HCC progression. Although
NASH increases HCC risk, it is also accompanied by tumor suppressive hepatocyte senescence. We confirmed
abundant hepatocyte senescence in human NASH and using MUP-uPA mice that progress to NASH in response
to high fructose diet (HFrD), we found hepatocyte senescence to be triggered by diet-induced DNA damage and
activation of the DNA damage response (DDR), which was also detected in human NASH. The DDR results in
activation of TP53, which induces FBP1 gene transcription and indirectly leads to NRF2 degradation. The FBP1-
NRF2 balance is inverted in favor of FBP1 in mouse and human HCC. By analyzing 349 human HCC specimens,
we found that TP53 and FBP1 are downregulated in 75-80% of them, correlating with AKT and NRF2 activation.
Single-cell RNA sequencing of diseased human livers led to identification of a novel subpopulation of disease-
associated hepatocytes (daHep), the first cells in which TP53 and FBP1 are downregulated and NRF2 is
activated. We propose that daHep are the precursors to HCC and equivalent to HCC progenitor cells (HcPC) we
detected in mice. Hepatocyte specific FBP1 ablation or NRF2 activation dismantle senescence and greatly
accelerate HCC development, preceded by diet-induced DNA damage that leads to accumulation of oncogenic
mutations. Despite this major advance in understanding NASH to HCC progression, several major questions
remain and will be addressed using HFrD-fed MUP-uPA mice and human NASH and HCC specimens. 1. What
causes FBP1 and TP53 downregulation and NRF2 activation in daHep and their mouse equivalents? 2. Do
senescent hepatocytes directly convert to HCC progenitors or do HcPC arise from DNA damaged hepatocytes
escaping senescence? 3. What causes DNA damage and mutations in HFrD-fed MUP-uPA/FBP1ΔHep or
NRASG12V transduced livers? In addition to HFrD feeding, we will use hydrodynamic injection of oncogenic
NRASG12V as a faster approach to HCC induction, which our preliminary studies show to be also controlled by
the NRF2-FBP1 “tug-of-war,” and will apply state-of-the-art experimental approaches, including single-cell and
spatial “omics”, duplex DNA sequencing for detection of ultralow frequency mutations and lineage tracing."

1) Background, key gaps in our understanding, and important challenges to be addressed. This project
aims to address crucial gaps in our understanding of nucleotide biosynthesis and its impact on cell fate
determination. While conventional research has predominantly focused on nucleotide biosynthesis in relation to
proliferation, recent findings from our laboratory have unveiled its unexpected role in triggering cell fate shifts.
Specifically, we have observed that inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis drives multipotent progenitor cells to
transition from adipogenesis to smooth muscle cell differentiation. Our primary objective is to decipher the
underlying mechanism governing how nucleotides regulate diverse cell fate outcomes both in controlled in vitro
environments and complex in vivo systems. 2) Description of recent progress by the PI. During my post-
doctoral work, I systematically elucidated the initial metabolic alterations linked to adipogenesis, leveraging
advanced metabolomics and metabolic flux analyses. Notably, my investigations unveiled that the
reprogramming of mitochondrial branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism serves as an early trigger that
precedes and facilitates the transcriptional modulation of PPARg, thereby initiating adipogenesis (Zaganjor et
al., 2020). These studies have provided a conceptual advance that metabolism can be targeted to reprogram
cell fate. Furthermore, in a recent breakthrough, my research team at Vanderbilt demonstrated that inhibiting
nucleotide biosynthesis profoundly reshapes cell fate trajectories (Shinde and Nunn et al., 2023), with a
consequential impact on the mitochondrial transcriptome. The subsequent functional assays underscored that
this inhibition prompts a shift in mitochondrial fuel preference from glucose to fatty acid oxidation. This intriguing
observation prompted us to postulate that nucleotide biosynthesis orchestrates cellular outcomes by modulating
mitochondrial metabolism. 3) Overview of future research program. Our future studies will critically assess
whether fuel switching, and nucleotide biosynthesis alter gene regulatory networks to shape cellular outcomes.
We will employ an innovative and ambitious interdisciplinary research program combining biochemistry,
genetics, cell biology and multi-OMICS approaches to answer fundamental questions such as: What is the
mechanism by which inhibition of nucleotide biosynthesis promotes smooth muscle cell differentiation? Does
blocking nucleotide biosynthesis promote angiogenesis in vivo? We plan to combine our conceptual expertise in
metabolism with the state-of-the-art technology to achieve our five-year vision and generate tools and a “working
blueprint” by which we can fine-tune metabolic pathways to modulate cell differentiation."

One in 10 adults who are aged 65 or older and 1 in 3 adults who are aged 85 or older meet the clinical diagnostic
criteria for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), making AD a public health crisis. These statistics are certain to be
underestimates of the disease’s total impact, given that disease onset precedes symptom onset by many years
in all cases. With no known cure, the prevalence and impact of AD will only become more dire as the population
ages. Effective intervention is contingent on the identification of behavioral and neurobiological markers that
appear in preclinical AD. While most AD research has focused on declines in learning and memory, people with
preclinical AD often have changes to their self-awareness of both physiological and psychological functions prior
to any detectable impairments to learning and memory. Changes to the insular cortex, the putative neural
correlate of self-awareness, have also been characterized in preclinical AD. Behaviors reflective of self-
awareness, and their associated neurobiological substrates, are therefore important potential targets of study
and intervention. The proposed work will characterize these behaviors alongside neurobiological changes in a
highly tractable and translational animal model, where the onset of AD-related neuropathology can be tightly
controlled. We will introduce amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) into the brains of middle-aged rhesus monkeys—a
manipulation that we have shown causes neuropathology consistent with early AD in humans. In the first aim,
we will assess changes to behavioral indices of self-awareness of physiology (i.e., interoception) and self-
awareness of cognition (i.e., metacognition). In the second aim, we will characterize changes to the structural
integrity and functional connectivity of the insula using magnetic resonance imaging. In the third aim, we will
examine the insula postmortem for known biomarkers of AD pathology. The aims of this proposal have been
designed such that all experiments have direct translation to established behavioral tests and techniques
available for use with human patients. The proposed experiments have also been designed to maximize training
potential in behavioral, imaging, histological, and statistical techniques."
10906823,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Remarkably, chromosomes avoid entanglement as they are organized into various spatial domains that support
diverse functions in the nucleus. Among these functions, 3D organization of the genome is uniquely essential for
constraining patterns of gene expression. This is perhaps best demonstrated by the phenomenon of olfactory
receptor (OR) choice in the mammalian olfactory epithelium. Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the olfactory
epithelium stochastically choose 1 of ~1400 OR genes to stably express. The chosen OR defines an OSN’s
receptive field and is thus a crucial element of OSN identity. Since the discovery of the OR gene pool ~30 years
ago, a mechanism for OR choice remains undefined. However, research from our lab has revealed that OR
expression depends on differentiation-dependent alterations to nuclear architecture. In olfactory stem cells,
heterochromatin detaches from the nuclear periphery leading to inversion of the nucleus. OR genes
subsequently organize into multichromosomal compartments near the newly formed heterochromatic core.
Lastly a network OR-gene specific enhancers known as Greek Islands (GIs), assemble over a single OR allele,
forming an “OR-Enhancer Hub”, to support OR transcription. While all three events are indispensable for OR
expression, the formation of the OR-Enhancer Hub is perhaps the most important. 63 GIs have been identified;
however, in any cell, only a subset participate in the OR-Enhancer Hub, forming highly specific interactions with
the active OR allele. The unique organization of GIs around an OR gene was considered to be the architectural
footprint of the single transcriptionally active OR. However, single-cell genomics data from our lab demonstrate
that topologically identical structures exist elsewhere in the nucleus. These complexes are defined by the same
enhancer constitution as the active hub yet contain transcriptionally silent OR genes. However, additional single-
cell experiments suggest these structures might be distinguished by underlying biochemical features. In this
proposal we aim to first characterize the chromatin properties that separate active from inactive enhancer hubs,
then test possible mechanisms for how these structures might assemble and gain different functional properties.
We have devised a single-cell genomic strategy to decipher the chromatin marks and bound transcription factors
that differentiate enhancer subtypes, focusing on those that explain GI association to the active OR gene. OR
transcription early in development is a known tropic signal for GI recruitment, reinforcing OR choice. Therefore,
we will perform analysis of genome structure and functional molecular features in mice mutated to perturb stages
of the OR gene expression pathway to identify determinants of OR-Enhancer hub assembly. We anticipate that
these experiments will reveal a biological scheme by which the coordinated spatial rearrangement of the genome
alongside patterned modifications to chromatin guide gene expression in a unique cell of the nervous system."
10906827,"Project Summary
A major long-term goal of my laboratory is to determine molecular feedback mechanisms
responsible for coordination between the cell division cycle and differentiation of embryonic stem
cells (ESCs). ESCs have great therapeutic potential for regenerative medicine, because they can
differentiate into any cell type and have unlimited self-renewal potential. This remarkable
biological potential, known as pluripotency, is associated with a complex transcription network,
an ultrafast cell division cycle that lacks typical checkpoints, and an atypical response to activation
of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway. While a lot of progress has been made
in characterizing the pluripotency transcription network, less is known about the cell division cycle
of ESCs and its molecular links to the pluripotency transcription network. In addition, a critical yet
poorly understood process is how ESCs use the MAPK pathway to control their self-renewal and
differentiation. Our driving hypothesis is that the cell division cycle and pluripotency
transcription network are linked through a bidirectional molecular feedback loop that is
regulated by the MAPK activity. To test our hypothesis, we will: I. Characterize novel regulators
of the MAPK pathway identified in our CRISPR screen in ESCs II. Determine functional substrate
network of the MAPK kinases, Mek and Erk, in ESCs using chemical-genetic kinase engineering
and quantitative phosphoproteomics. III. Determine mechanisms of pluripotency maintenance by
the G1 cell cycle kinase (Cdk2) using direct labeling of the substrates by chemical-genetic
engineering of Cdk2. To successfully complete proposed experiments, I have established
collaborations with Professor Stanley Qi laboratory (Stanford University), Professor Alice Ting
laboratory (Stanford University), Professor Seth Rubin laboratory (University of California, Santa
Cruz) and Professor Boris Macek laboratory (University of Tubingen). By gaining detailed insight
into the molecular mechanisms linking the cell division cycle and differentiation of ESCs, the
outcome of this R35 proposal will provide novel strategies to address a key challenge in the field
of regenerative medicine that is efficient and reproducible differentiation of ESCs for therapeutic
purposes."
10907677,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 The vast majority of pediatric and adult cardiac surgery procedures worldwide involve the use of
cardiopulmonary bypass with a dedicated and highly customized perfusion system. Cardiac surgery
procedures are complex and entail safety-critical activities, requiring continuous coordination between four
subteams: perfusion, surgical, nursing and anesthesia. This environment demands outstanding technical and
non-technical skills (e.g. teamwork, communication and situational awareness).
 Over the past few decades, technological advancements have improved the safety and efficiency of the
perfusion system, however, despite substantial progress, recent studies continue to report a high incidence of
preventable intraoperative adverse events among cardiac surgery patients. The perfusion system, in particular,
relies heavily on the expertise and skills of the perfusionist, and there is currently no computational intelligent
system to support perfusionists' optimal decision-making during the critical phase of cardiopulmonary bypass.
 In this proposal, we seek to develop a data-driven approach to learn from expert perfusionists how to achieve
optimal outcomes for cardiac surgery patients. Rather than attempt to engineer a solution, we propose to
develop a computer-based apprentice that can learn from high-quality demonstrations of perfusionist actions to
infer gold-standard patient care. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a Robot-Assisted Perfusion System
(RAPS) that can be integrated into the cardiac surgery workflow as a non-human teammate. The RAPS will
support the perfusion team in a way that perfusionists still will keep control of the perfusion system (i.e. human-
in-the-loop), but cognitively supported and guided by the RAPS."

This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) proposal will develop Dr. Greta Bushnell’s career
as an independent investigator, and enable her to advance into a new line of research focused on evaluating
misuse and abuse related morbidity of medicines prescribed to young people and the policies and practices that
can mitigate these harmful outcomes. This new direction of research requires distinct training in substance abuse
policy, misuse and abuse liability of prescription drugs, adolescent development of substance use, analysis of
state-level policies, and advanced methods to address confounding control. With a training program supported
by an experienced team of investigators, Dr. Bushnell will complete the proposed research, filling key gaps
surrounding benzodiazepine (BZD) misuse and abuse related harms in young people and modifiable factors to
reduce these harms. This research focus comes at a pertinent time of rising BZD-related morbidity, continued
prescribing, lack of safety data in youth at developmental risk for substance use problems, and current
opportunities to leverage opioid-related policies to reduce BZD-related harms. Overdose deaths involving BZDs
significantly increased in recent years with »11,500 deaths in 2017, partially attributed to the opioid crisis, and in
adolescents and young adults there were »39,000 emergency department visits for BZD-related poisonings in
2016. Despite BZDs being frequently prescribed to adolescents (3%) and young adults (6%), there are no
estimates on overdose risk following BZD treatment and it is unknown whether and to what extent BZD
prescribing to youth inadvertently increases risk of BZD or other substance misuse later in life. Prescription drug
monitoring programs (PDMPs) represent a potentially important, but understudied, means to mitigate BZD-
related morbidity. PDMPs are state-run surveillance systems collecting patient details on prescriptions for
controlled substances with capabilities to detect risky prescribing. Dr. Bushnell will use large, national
administrative claims data (2000/2001-2018) covering privately and publicly insured young people (10-29 years)
to evaluate whether selected state PDMP features decrease BZD-related harms and risky BZD prescribing in
young people (Aim 1). To evaluate individual-level risks, she will quantify overdose risk following BZD treatment
in young people compared to alternative treatments and by prescription details (Aim 2) using the national claims
datasets with measures from Area Health Resources Files. She will then evaluate whether adolescent BZD
treatment increases downstream risks of BZD misuse or harmful substance use in early adulthood (Aim 3) using
the nationwide Monitoring the Future sample of high school seniors with panel surveys into early adulthood
(»2,450/year, 1976-2016). The proposal will inform an R01 submission on identifying youth-specific risk factors
in the progression from treatment with BZDs, or other controlled substances, to abuse and leveraging this
knowledge to inform interventions. Addressing these questions and developing this new line of research are only
feasible with intensive training, support, and protected time, which the K01 can provide."
10905253,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic heart disease and its complications are the primary cause of death in industrialized nations. Following
myocardial infarction (MI), ~20-30% of patients develop heart failure, primarily due to loss of contractility through
cardiomyocyte death, inflammation, and formation of scar tissue. Despite intensive research efforts, outcomes
from new regenerative therapies for MI - such as those utilizing stem cells - have been disappointing to date.
However, there is now compelling evidence that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exert their cardio-reparative
effects through the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose intrinsic biological properties make them ide-
al candidates for off-the-shelf therapies for ischemic heart disease. Despite a large body of research demon-
strating the tissue-regenerative effects of EVs, their efficient delivery to injured myocardium has been hampered
by three significant challenges: 1) injected EVs tend to diffuse quickly; 2) EVs and other carriers are not retained
long-term in the heart; and 3) local intramyocardial injection is highly invasive. Systemic injection is safer but fails
to deliver a sufficient dosage to the heart. Despite significant efforts to develop targeted delivery methods, there
have been no substantive breakthroughs in addressing these challenges.
The main objective of the proposal is to develop a novel delivery strategy that significantly improves EV
accumulation and substantially prolongs cardiac retention in the injured heart. The specific aims of the study are
as follows: (1) Synthesize and optimize EV formulations and dosing regimens and evaluate their biodistribution,
biocompatibility, toxicity, and immunogenicity using a mouse model of MI. Furthermore, we will assess EV
interactions with cells. (2) Investigate the capability of the optimized EV formulations to facilitate cardiac repair
and explore the underlying mechanisms of action in a mouse model of MI. (3) Assess the effectiveness of EVs
in mediating cardiac repair in a swine model of MI.
These studies will pave the way for developing off-the-shelf EV therapies that can be administered non-
invasively, offering effective treatment options for post-MI care without requiring invasive, open-chest surgery.
This study will establish the critical design parameters of a first-in-class, non-invasive delivery and treatment
strategy achieved through controlled in situ crosslinking. Importantly, our approach can be applied to different
ligands and carrier systems (i.e., micro- and nanoparticles) for enhanced accumulation and retention, not only
at infarct sites, but also other diseases."
10909107,"Project Summary
 The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms controlling
epidermal tissue homeostasis. Thousands of genes are differentially expressed between undifferentiated and
differentiated keratinocytes, yet our current understanding of the gene regulatory mechanisms still remain
incomplete. In the context of transcription, which is the first and crucial stage of gene expression, a lot of efforts
have been concentrated on the first transcription initiation step. The roles of two other transcription steps,
namely the elongation and termination steps, remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this research plan is
designed to bridge this knowledge gap by characterizing the regulatory roles of transcription elongation and
termination processes in controlling epidermal gene expression.
 Our preliminary characterization revealed that undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes acquire
differential expression patterns of transcription elongation and termination regulators. Leveraging our expertise
on genomics, proteomics, and human tissue models, we will determine how transcription elongation and
termination regulators cooperate with their interacting proteins to differentially regulate the elongation and
termination processes to control epidermal progenitor maintenance versus terminal tissue differentiation.
 Dysregulation of epidermal gene expression underlies the pathogenesis of a spectrum of human skin
diseases including psoriasis, chronic wound healing, and cancer. Increased understanding of gene regulation
controlled by these under-characterized elongation and termination processes can generate novel therapeutic
ideas for treating human skin diseases."

shift perturbation, protein dynamics and probability of finding productive mutations, which allowed us to create
an unnatural metalloenzyme with with a 107-fold improvement over the background rate and less than 100-fold
away from the diffusion limit. I propose to expand NMR-guided directed evolution to 1) utilize other protein
dynamics probing modalities to aaply the approach to larger proteins; 2) develop catalysts for practically useful
reactions; 3) develop of metal-binding proteins with high metal affinity. Results generated in the proposed work
will help advance fundamental understanding of the principles that define function in metalloproteins and drive
enzymatic activity. From the practical standpoint, this work will allow for creation of smaller functional proteins
capable of promoting chemical transformations and produce inexpensive and biocompatible protein catalysts
that could be easily handled in the applied setting for pesticide/chemical weapons remediation, DNA hydrolysis
and phenol oxidation. Project 2: I will develop new approaches to osteoarthritis treatment using smart, stimuli-
responsive, self-healing biocompatible antimicrobial hydrogels. In addition to direct biomedical application of the
designed hydrogel materials, structural models for the hydrogel assemblies will facilitate our understanding of
the mechanism of gelation of metallopeptides and will guide rational design of improved materials.

10919762,"Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has long known that Veterans who have recently had a suicidal crisis such
as those in acute psychiatric hospitalization are at increased risk for suicide. In response, VHA developed a
suicide prevention strategy and enhanced usual care (EUC) for high-risk Veterans by adding care coordination,
safety plans, and access to a 24-hour crisis hotline. There has also been a broad array of innovative suicide
prevention trials across VHA. However, the only intervention that has shown promise in reducing risk for suicide
attempts in Veterans is Safety Planning, that has already been implemented across VHA. Despite these efforts,
suicide rates following such crises have plateaued and there has been no observable reduction in risk in this
population, requiring the development and testing of additional strategies that complement these already
implemented approaches.
Research suggests that treatments to reduce suicidal behavior may need to focus on both the motivation to live
and the motivation to die to obtain optimal effects. The PI developed a revised version of Motivational
Interviewing to Address Suicidal Ideation (MI-SI-R) to help Veterans resolve ambivalence about living by
increasing the motivation to live, that is delivered as one-to-two in-person sessions with a telephone booster
session. In a preliminary randomized controlled trial (RCT) in psychiatrically hospitalized Veterans, MI-SI-R plus
EUC was associated with 50% fewer suicide attempts and 41% lower likelihood of suicidal ideation compared to
EUC alone. Furthermore, post-hoc analyses suggested that MI-SI-R had a stronger impact on suicide attempt
risk among those with an attempt history, but a stronger impact on suicidal ideation among those without a
suicide attempt history, which requires replication. Additional research is also needed to deepen our
understanding of MI-SI-R and its hypothesized mechanistic model by examining its efficacy among patients with
different psychiatric disorders and its putative motivational mechanisms.
We are proposing an RCT comparing MI-SI-R plus EUC (MI-SI-R+EUC) to EUC alone in a sample of 470 high-
risk Veterans with recent suicidal crises from three VHA Medical Centers, with “high-risk” defined as a suicide
attempt within a month or suicidal ideation > 5 on the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation. Half (n = 235) will be
randomized to MI-SI-R+EUC (three sessions in-person, via Video Connect, or telephone) and the remaining
participants (n = 235) will receive EUC alone. All participants will be asked to complete telephone follow-up
assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months after randomization. This will allow us to determine the efficacy of MI-SI-
R+EUC in reducing risk for suicide attempts (Aim 1) and reducing overall suicidal ideation (Aim 2) when
compared to EUC alone. We will also explore the possibility that MI-SI-R+EUC has a differential impact among
patients with different suicide attempt histories and different psychiatric disorders and investigate putative
motivational mechanisms (Exploratory Aim 3).
This study is significant because suicide prevention is a VHA priority and targets a population that is known to
be at very high-risk with a brief intervention that has high potential for implementation. It is innovative because
it tests a revised intervention that targets the motivation to live making it novel among interventions that have
been tested in full-scale trials, explores potential conditions that may impact its efficacy, and examines
hypothesized motivational mechanisms."
10905626,"Men are at higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) than age- and BMI-matched women, especially
early in life when androgens are high. However, androgens are needed for health in men, particularly in muscle
where they promote glucose metabolism and fatty acid utilization. Gap: we don’t know the mechanisms for the
disconnect between the protective functions of androgens and the higher risk of CHD in men. Additionally,
although men and women share risk factors for CHD (hypertension, high LDL cholesterol and others), there are
likely also sex-specific risk factors for the development of diabetes, fatty liver, and cardiovascular disease in both
males and females. We don’t know the therapeutic significance of targeting these sex-specific pathways.
 In the last funding cycle of this project, our group helped define mechanisms for numerous species
differences in the risk of metabolic and CHD with obesity. In humans and rodents, endogenous estrogens and
androgens have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism. The increased risk of CHD in men is unique to
humans. One key species difference is that humans express cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which
mice naturally lack. Using mice transgenic for CETP we “humanized” this pathway and discovered that CETP
transduces unique estrogenic pathways in the liver of females that are beneficial. We discovered that
CETP also transduces unique effects of androgens in liver of the males, but that these are largely harmful
for triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism; thus “humanizing” these aspects of sex-specific CVD risk.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that hepatic CETP expression drives sex-specific risk of dyslipidemia and
CHD by creating gain-of-function androgen signaling and estrogen signaling in in the liver. We propose 3 AIMS
to reduce the harmful lipid effects of androgens in males and preserve the beneficial glucose effects. Additionally,
we will identify sex-specific risk factors in both males and females and help translate them to therapeutic targets.
 In AIM1 we will knock-down hepatic androgen receptor, or over-express hepatic CETP, to define if the CETP-
androgen interaction that causes dyslipidemia is a direct effect of androgens and CETP in the liver. We will use
metabolic tracers to simultaneously define glucose and fatty acid metabolism in both liver and muscle.
 We found that CETP alters androgen-regulation of ~3900 liver mRNAs, including gain-of-function for
cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism. In AIM2 we will target two key factors that are uniquely up-regulated by
androgens when CETP is present, LXR and ChREBP. We expect to preserve androgen benefits on muscle
glucose and fatty acid metabolism but block the CETP-androgen axis with regard to dyslipidemia and CHD risk.
 In AIM3 we will take approaches to reduce the key translational barriers in the mouse with regard to lipid
metabolism: 1) the absence of CETP; 2) increased metabolic rate; and 3) different bile acid composition. We will
use approaches for each to make them more human-like, then with this model the demonstrate proof-of-principle
therapeutic value of a liver-targeted estrogen-glucagon receptor co-agonist in both males and females."
10906561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Without movement, we would be utterly unable to interact with the world. All behaviors, including
speech, writing, reaching, grasping, gaze, walking and posture require the coordinated activities
of many motor areas. Further, sensory signals provide essential feedback to these motor areas,
enabling accurate motor control and motor learning, as well as providing information vital for
deciding future behaviors. As a result, understanding the sensorimotor control of even the most
basic movements, like orienting toward a sudden sound or reaching to pick up a glass of water,
is complex.
Damage to these sensorimotor pathways can produce a wide range of debilitating neurological
disorders including tremor, Parkinson's disease, ataxia, dystonia, and spasticity - all of which
markedly decrease quality of life. The Society for the Neural Control of Movement (NCM) is an
international community of scientists, clinician-investigators and trainees engaged in research
whose common goal is to understand how the brain controls movement and to address the deficits
that occur in disease. NCM promotes a broad range of research using interdisciplinary
approaches (e.g., neurophysiological, anatomical, molecular, computational, and behavioral),
different animal models, and studies of intact subjects and those with neurological disorders.
The inaugural NCM Meeting took place in 1991. The success of the society and its annual meeting
has led to a continual growth in membership, meeting attendance, and the breadth of scientific
content. With support through the NIH, the 2024 NCM meeting will make substantive progress
towards furthering three main goals of the society: Aim 1) Stimulate new research approaches
and collaborations among NCM meeting attendees by identifying new topics and appropriate
scientists as speakers, Aim 2) continue to increase the gender and ethnic diversity within the NCM
leadership and in meeting programing, and Aim 3) promote and support the development of the
next generation of motor control researchers by providing financial and career support for
graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Overall, the unique format of the annual NCM
meeting, with its focus on interdisciplinary approaches, discussion, and scientific interaction in an
intimate meeting environment, is of immeasurable value to furthering worldwide understanding of
how the brain controls movement in both health and disease."

Tailoring care to match patients to the treatment most effective for them has the potential to accelerate
recovery and meaningfully reduce the growing burden of depression. A key barrier to tailoring care is the
absence of objective, real-time methods to effectively predict and assess treatment response. Mobile
technology holds promise to overcome this barrier. Specifically, smartphones and wearable sensors collect
passive, continuous and objective measures of constructs central to depression, such as sleep, physical
activity, cardiovascular function, and social engagement. Studies have demonstrated associations of single
measures from these domains with depression. However, because most prior wearable studies have had
limited sample sizes, they have not been able to synthesize actionable information across multiple domains of
mobile technology data and effectively guide treatment. Our long-term goal is to substantially increase the
effectiveness of depression treatments and the capacity of our mental health care system. Our objective in this
application is to identify factors that can be used to effectively match patients to treatments and track their
recovery. Through the PROviding Mental health Precision Treatment (PROMPT) study, we will complete the
following specific aims: Aim 1) Identify factors that predict which treatment is most likely to reduce depression
symptoms for a specific patient; and Aim 2) Identify passive mobile technology-based measures that serve as
signals of treatment response. To achieve these aims, we will recruit 2,200 subjects from waitlist for outpatient
depression treatment. We will then track patients for six months through wearable sensors, smartphones, and
repeated surveys. For both aims, we will use machine learning approaches to develop comprehensive
prediction models. Our approach is innovative because it applies technology and analytic tools to a large and
diverse sample of subjects receiving treatment under real world conditions. Further, the project is designed to
lead directly to an organization-level intervention that matches patients to treatments and continuously
monitors their response to treatment. Finally, this project is significant because it has the potential to greatly
accelerate recovery by identifying the treatment from which each person is likely to derive the most benefit,
ultimately helping to address the high population burden of depression."

This is a resubmission of a competing renewal application for a mid-career investigator award in patient- oriented research (K24) for Dr. Gregory Lucas. Dr. Lucas is a Professor of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. He is medically trained as an infectious diseases specialist and he completed a PhD in clinical investigation at the Bloomberg School of Public Health. For 20 years, his research has had a dual focus: 1) associations of HIV, HCV, and drug use on kidney and cardiovascular disease, and 2) interventions to improve HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the US and elsewhere. In the previous funding period, Dr. Lucas made a major commitment to mentoring and leadership, while maintaining a strong track record of research and funding productivity. The objectives of this renewal application are to continue to support a program for mentoring junior investigators and to foster innovative research through interdisciplinary team building. The research strategy presents three active research platforms for engaging trainees in HIV- and PWID-related research. These three Parent Aims outline currently funded work that will serve as the framework for the K24 proposal. Each Parent Aim is linked to a newly proposed Expansion Aim that provides ownership opportunity for a junior researcher. Dr. Lucas is PI of a Baltimore-based cohort study, now in its second funding period, designed to characterize the roles of HIV, HCV, and cocaine use in kidney and cardiovascular disease (Parent Aim 1). This cohort is unique in having over 1200 iohexol glomerular filtration rate (iGFR) measurements in 384 participants, with up to 6 years of follow-up. The linked Expansion Aim 1 proposes to determine factors associated with the accuracy of creatinine- and cystatin C-based estimation of GFR slope in HIV-positive persons. Parent Aim 2 is a cluster- randomized trial evaluating the effectiveness of an integrated care van (ICV) in providing PWID- and HIV- related evidence-based services to PWID in Baltimore. Expansion Aim 2 proposes to assess the feasibility of providing HCV evaluation and treatment on the ICV and to compare strategies of referring community-recruited HCV-infected PWID to the ICV or to a city health department clinic (standard care) in a pilot randomized trial.
Parent Aim 3 describes a large and ongoing research portfolio focused on improving HIV prevention and treatment outcomes in key populations in international settings. Expansion Aim 3 proposes to assess respondent-driven sampling as an interventional tool to identify unaware/out-of-care HIV-positive PWID. The outstanding environment and resources for HIV- and drug use-related research at Johns Hopkins are a key backdrop to this proposal. Finally, Dr. Lucas proposes training to support his career development and team building to lead a multidisciplinary research response to the opioid epidemic in the US."

Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem; nearly half of adults in the U.S. have either diabetes or pre-
diabetes. The link between adiposity and the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is well characterized,
but less is known about the impact of environmental factors on risk of T2DM. Research increasingly implicates
traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) with increased risk of T2DM—especially in vulnerable urban populations,
but studies thus far have wide ranges of results or have substantial methodological limitations. Other
community-scale environmental factors, including aspects of the built and natural environment are also
potential risk or protective factors for T2DM and may act through interactions with physical activity, diet and
visceral adiposity. This study will incorporate state-of-the-art environmental exposure assessment with detailed
health measures and data on potential confounders, including genetic susceptibility, to study these
relationships---in a comprehensive framework—focusing on a fast-growing population at disproportionate risk
of T2DM risk, through the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort. HCHS/SOL

10929537,"The transcription factor NRF2 is a central regulator of cellular redox balance. Mutations in NRF2 and its negative
regulator KEAP1 are found in 15-34% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The result of these mutations is
constitutive NRF2 activation and chronic induction of a battery of NRF2 target genes, which confers resistance
to chemo/radiation therapy. While targeting NRF2 holds great therapeutic potential, there is no effective strategy
to inhibit the consequences of pathogenic KEAP1/NRF2 signaling. It is therefore critical to identify and
understand vulnerabilities of KEAP1/NRF2 mutant NSCLC to develop effective therapies for patients harboring
these mutations. NRF2 controls the transcription of many antioxidant enzymes, thereby regulating the
detoxification of reactive oxygen species. However, it remains largely unknown which specific antioxidant
enzymes can be therapeutically targeted to reverse the profound resistance of NRF2/KEAP1 mutations to
oxidative stress, the key mediator of chemo/radiation therapy. Glutathione (GSH)/GSH reductase (GSR) and
thioredoxin (TXN)/thioredoxin reductase (TXNRD) are two parallel, compensating thiol-dependent antioxidant
pathways that critically regulate and maintain cellular thiol redox homeostasis and protein dithiol/disulfide
balance. My preliminary results indicate that both GSR and TXNRD1 are strongly induced by NRF2 activation
and contribute to the intrinsic resistance to the pro-oxidant therapies. However, they play unique roles in different
cellular compartments. Specifically, NRF2 induced GSR acts to protect mitochondria from oxidation, while
TXNRD1 protects the cytosol. Further, TXNRD1 upregulation is associated with the suppression of other
selenoproteins, suggesting that NRF2 activation causes an imbalance in selenium distribution. Given the key
role of selenoprotein in redox biology, the switch in the production of the different selenoproteins induced by
NRF2 activation may create novel vulnerabilities of NRF2 active NSCLC with therapeutic potential. This proposal
is designed to further strengthen these observations by defining the mechanistic basis of how GSR contributes
to NRF2-mediated resistance to oxidative stress, and to leverage the imbalanced selenoprotein translation to
develop potent therapeutic strategies for KEAP1/NRF2 mutant NSCLC. The following specific aims are pursued
in this application: Aim 1. Investigate the role of GSR in NRF2-mediated resistance to oxidative stress. Aim 2.
Define the role of NRF2 as a modulator of the selenoproteome in NSCLC. The knowledge and scientific expertise
that I acquire from these proposed studies will facilitate my transition to an independent position. My long-term
goal is to study the antioxidant enzymes in cancer, with a major focus on selenoproteins. In addition to the
scientific goal, I have outlined a detailed career development plan to obtain skillsets that are key for leading a
research laboratory and establishing a strong research program. I will conduct the proposed research and carry
out the training plan under the guidance of my mentoring committee. I will embark on the excellent academic

Germline predisposition to hematopoietic malignancies (HMs) is more common than previously appreciated, but
individuals are spread throughout the country, with few local experts. The NIH provides focused clinics for
patients with germline GATA2 mutations under Drs. Holland and Hickstein and for those with germline RUNX1
mutations under Dr. Liu. The proposed U01 consortium will engage four extramural investigators, Drs. Lucy
Godley (The University of Chicago), Anupriya Agarwal (Oregon Health & Science University), Emery Bresnick
(University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Nancy Speck (University of Pennsylvania) to perform complementary
studies using primary samples from patients seen at the NIH Clinical Center. Increased inflammation is
characteristic of the infections suffered by immunodeficient individuals with germline GATA2 mutations, and
preliminary data from the extramural investigators suggest that germline RUNX1-mutant cells produce increased
levels of inflammatory molecules. The U01 investigators hypothesize that inflammation derived from intrinsic and
extrinsic sources drives bone marrow failure (BMF) in GATA2-mutant patients, plus clonal hematopoiesis (CH)
that frequently evolves into HMs in both syndromes. The U01 consortium will test this hypothesis using three
Aims: Aim 1- Identify which germline GATA2 and RUNX1 VUSs are deleterious by analyzing their influences on
BM hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). VUSs identified
in patients presenting to the NIH Clinical Center will be characterized functionally using growth and differentiation
assays of patient-derived HSPCs, non-hematopoietic MSCs, and an MSC cell line benchmarking them against
wild-type and known deleterious or benign variants. Aim 2- Establish how inflammatory mechanisms interface
with germline GATA2 and RUNX1 mutations to alter HSPC and MSC growth and differentiation. We will identify
the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines overproduced by RUNX1- and GATA2-mutant BM cells in response to
TLR4 ligands and determine their impact as well as that of LPS on colony formation, serial-replating, and
differentiation of RUNX1- and GATA2-mutant HSPCs and MSCs. We will establish a pre-clinical model of
inflammation-induced BMF in Gata2-deficient mice and determine the contribution of elevated TLR signaling to
their hematopoietic defects. Aim 3- Determine how acquired mutations and inflammation promote the expansion
of germline-mutant HSCs. CH occurs more frequently and at an earlier age in patients with germline GATA2-
and RUNX1-mutations compared to the general population. We will use xenograft and syngeneic mouse models
to determine how inflammation drives bone marrow failure in Gata2-deficient mice and facilitates the
growth/survival of germline GATA2- or RUNX1-mutant HSPCs with acquired somatic mutations, providing a
clonal advantage that ultimately evolves into leukemia. The results of these studies will be used to design a
clinical trial to decrease systemic inflammation and delay or prevent clonal expansion and risk of developing
BMF and HMs, thus improving the lives of our patients."

ability to meet recruitment goals. The UH3 phase (years 3-5 of the grant) will be devoted to implementing 2
projects under the thematic health disparity problem of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Project 1
will focus on NAFLD over the Lifespan in Hawaii and assess the prevalence, risk, co-morbidities, and age at
onset of NAFLD in IPP. Project 2 will focus on rates and risks of NAFLD among our sexual and gender minority
groups living with HIV to uncover the HIV-specific factors that may contribute to risk above and beyond those
in the general population."

Coordination between the replication and transcription process is one of the major challenges that cells face during
proliferation. As both replication and transcription machinery use the same genomic DNA as a template, to avoid conflicts,
spatial-temporal separation between these two processes is necessary. Cells have evolved different mechanisms to evade
conflicts but several physiological contexts such as the proximity of transcription start site to replication origins or diverse,
adaptive transcription programs throughout different cell types together with the vast number of replication origins in human
cells make distinct demarcation between these two processes hard to achieve. Moreover, several pathological conditions
such as oncogene activation during cancer onset further complicate matters by altering the replication and transcription
program and inducing transcription-replication conflicts profusely. Transcription-replication conflicts are known to perturb
DNA replication and induce DNA damage and genome instability. Although how these conflicts affect the other key
component of the conflicts, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), its elongation speed, or transcription in general remains
completely unexplored. Moreover, RNAPII speed or transcription kinetics regulate critical co-transcriptional processes such
as alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and transcription termination, thus regulating the production of
alternative splice variants, circular RNAs, alternatively polyadenylated transcripts, or read‐through transcripts. Hence,
alteration in just RNAPII speed could lead to the expression of different isoforms of proteins with potential physiological
significance. My long-term goal is to understand the regulation of multiple aspects of transcriptional and co-transcriptional
processes by transcription-replication conflicts and DNA damage in general especially during tumorigenesis. Moreover, I
aim to enhance our understanding of how cells use different mechanisms to deal with the conflicts at different regions of
the genome and how these pathways, dedicated to resolve conflicts, are coordinated.
 In the next five years, my proposal, for the first time, will systematically explore the effect of transcription-
replication conflicts on transcription, investigate the role and significance of RNAPII speed in maintaining cellular fitness,
and characterize the mechanistic role of the Integrator complex on the conflicts. Integrator is a transcription processing
machinery that I recently discovered to have the ability to mitigate the damaging effects of transcription-replication
conflicts.
 I anticipate that these studies will act as a platform for future efforts to understand the interplay of transcription and
replication in controlling cellular homeostasis. Broadly, this work is part of a larger effort by my lab to understand whether
conflicts are a regulated process, triggering cellular changes of physiological significance rather than a futile accident.
Furthermore, these results will form the basis for future efforts screen for small molecules with the ability to modulate
RNAPII speed, which potentially be useful to treat different conditions where RNAPII speed is modulated, for example
ageing and cancer."

Reactive sulfur species (RSS), including hydrogen sulfide (H2S), persulfides (RSSH), and
polysulfides (RSSnR, n>1), are endogenously expressed biomolecules that play an important role
in human health and disease. For example, the biological activity of the most prominent member
of this class of compounds, H2S, has been shown to include anticancer activity, neuroprotection,
vascular relaxation, hormonal regulation, and energy production. Given these effects, it comes as
no surprise that RSS supplementation is being explored with great interest in preclinical models
of human illnesses, including cancer, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular-
related pathologies, and other age-related illnesses. However, due to their high reactivity and
short half-life, the effective delivery and detection of RSS is extremely challenging. Thus, RSS
have untapped potential when it comes to the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In a similar
fashion, reactive selenium species (RSeS), such as hydrogen selenide (H2Se) and
hydroselenosulfides (RSeSH and RSSeH), have begun to attract significant attention from the
chemical biology and medicinal chemistry communities due to their purported therapeutic
properties. However, the biological activity of these selenium congeners is not well documented
due to similar inadequacies when it comes to their delivery and detection. Therefore, the work
described in this proposal is significant as it seeks to overcome these barriers by implementing
new and innovative chemistry that will harness the reactivity of RSS and RSeS to help realize the
biomedical applicability of these molecules for both the development of novel therapeutics,
including small molecule donors (or RSS/RSeS releasing compounds) with improved properties
(organelle-targeting, pathology-selective activation, self-reporting features for monitoring donor
progress and trafficking, and novel co-drug designs for improved activity and/or chemoprotective
effects) and diagnostics (reaction-based fluorescent sensors and RSS/RSeS-triggered
theranostics). This contribution will be innovative as it is expected to open the door to new
approaches for therapeutic intervention involving both RSS and RSeS."

This work is anchored on the findings by our group, and others, showing that prior to treatment, the HIV virus
inflicts bone mineral density (BMD) loss in People living with HIV (PLH) due to multifactorial mechanisms.
Furthermore, Antiretroviral therapy (ART) inflicts additional aggressive, but acute, bone loss within a defined
window (~6 months) following ART initiation. Although some first line ART drugs cause mild bone loss due to
direct effects, the aggressive bone loss characteristic of most highly immunosuppressed PLH, is an indirect effect
of adaptive immune system reconstitution and reactivation, driven in large measure through CD4 T cell activation
which is supported by microbial factors. Because this intense, but acute, BMD loss is driven by inflammatory
events related to immune regeneration, even newer ART drugs cause severe bone loss in severely
immunocompromised patients. Importantly, although we and others have documented this immune
reconstitution bone loss (IRBL) in the long bones and spine, it may not be limited to these compartments and
new preliminary data using our mouse model of IRBL, suggest that the alveolar bone of the jaw anchoring the
teeth, is also severely degraded. This is an important finding given that our extended group has reported that
periodontal infection (periodontitis) is 3-fold higher in PLH. Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease, in
which bacteria such as the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis, overrun the oral compartment, a likely
consequence of impaired immune surveillance due to HIV-induced immunodeficiency. Like IRBL, periodontitis
also causes loss of the alveolar bone anchoring the teeth, leading to tooth loosening and eventual loss.
Periodontal infection and tooth loss in people is a cause of morbidity, pain, and self-image issues, leading to a
decline in quality of life. We hypothesize that ART-induced IRBL, drives significant alveolar lone loss in PLH, that
exacerbates, or is exacerbated by, HIV-induced periodontal infection, leading to poor oral health that culminates
in tooth loosening and eventual tooth loss. In this application, we propose to study alveolar IRBL and the
intersection of IRBL with periodontitis in a clinical study in PLH (Specific Aim 1) and in a complementary
mechanistic basic science study (Specific Aim 2) using animal models of IRBL and periodontal infection. Findings
from this work will contribute to efforts aimed at identifying PLH at risk of poor oral health leading to tooth loss.
The outcomes will provide strong rationale for exploring targeted prophylaxis including antibiotics and anti-
resorptive drugs to protect the alveolar bone and the teeth from ART-associated IRBL."

Background: HIV infection in the brain occurs early after transmission and leads to chronic neuroinflammation.
Although modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) controls viral replication, there is no cure for HIV, and successful
control of viral replication has not completely ameliorated inflammation and HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Microglia play a central role in other neurodegenerative disorders and are
the likely primary reservoir for HIV in the brain, but little else is known about the inflammatory character
associated with HAND. Additionally, the inflammatory incitement associated with HIV is potentially determined
by its expression of viral proteins, dictated by the epigenetic microenvironment of the provirus, which is poorly
characterized. Recently, the Nurr1 receptor was described as an important mediator of HIV-1 silencing in the
context of microglia in vitro, making it a prospective focal point for further studies in brain tissue.
Study Cohort: We will leverage the unique Last Gift rapid autopsy cohort, which allows us to preserve cellular
integrity and nucleic acids in precious tissue samples collected from PWH. We will select frontal cortex and basal
ganglia from 15 Last Gift participants to analyze for this proposal.
Our goal: Using powerful single cell sequencing techniques, we will characterize the epigenetic regulators of the
HIV provirus in brain myeloid cells from 15 PWH using novel epigenetic enrichment techniques and assimilated
data on integration sites and the full-length proviral sequence generated as part of the Last Gift project (Aim 1).
Next, using brain myeloid cells isolated from a subset of the participants (N=6), we will further explore the
mechanistic framework of the HIV provirus in microglia through manipulation of the proviral epigenetic profile
using in vitro Nurr1 agonists and epigenetic modulators (Aim 2). Finally, we will use single cell techniques to
examine the epigenetic and transcriptomic profile of the inflammatory milieu in the brains of PWH on suppressive
ART and correlate them with proviral load and cell-associated viral RNA (Aim 3).
How will we advance the field? The epigenetic characteristics of the HIV provirus have not been examined in the
brains of people with HIV (PWH). Most evaluation of proviral epigenetics has been focused upon CD4+ T cells,
but thus far few have examined epigenetic mechanisms of proviral reactivation in microglia from PWH, and none
have been able to define these mechanisms thoroughly in tissue samples or cells isolated from brains of PWH.
Therefore, this proposal will advance our understanding of HIV persistence in the brain on multiple fronts.
Additionally, the inflammatory pathogenesis of NCI in HIV infection is poorly characterized, but our proposal
would not only allow definition of the immune cell character in the brains of PWH, but also the epigenetic and
transcriptomic mechanisms at play in all cell types, including neurons and astrocytes."
10924914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Black women (BW) in the US are disproportionately affected by HIV. Concurrently, Black women face
sociostructural inequities including structural racism, HIV stigma, and medical mistrust, in addition to the
syndemic effects of substance use, and intimate partner violence, and adverse mental health. These factors act
as barriers to health seeking behaviors that contribute to poor HIV outcomes. BW’s participation in HIV clinical
research remains historically low and BW’s participation in HIV research (i.e., prevention, treatment, cure), which
remains historically low, is contextualized within a system that does not consider their intersectional identities
(i.e., race, gender), while routinely excluding women due to biological (e.g., reproductive potential, menstruation,
pregnancy), social (e.g., restrictive contraception requirements, provider bias, perceived as “hard to reach”), and
structural factors (e.g., lack of welcoming research spaces including extended hours and childcare support).
While studies have identified factors that limit women’s participation in HIV research, there is limited data on
perceptions of HIV research participation among BW. The prevalence of illicit substance use (e.g., cocaine,
amphetamines) among Black women is higher than the national average. Consequently, there is a significant risk
of BW not benefitting from HIV related scientific advances (i.e., access to HIV medications, curative therapies)
derived from research. Guided by syndemic theory and intersectionality framework, this explanatory sequential
mixed methods study will utilize a case control approach to elucidate the effects of sociostructural inequities and
past-year substance use, and past-year intimate partner violence, and adverse mental health on participation in
HIV research among BW (Aim 1). For the case-control portion of the study, we will recruit, screen, and match
participants 1:1 across case and control groups (n=280, cases (n=140): participated in research; controls (n=140):
not yet participated in HIV research) along factors of (a) HIV serostatus and (b) recruitment source
(sociobehavioral, clinical, vaccine, biomedical prevention study and non-research efforts. Understanding these
effects on BW participation in HIV research may elucidate aspects for intervention (e.g., policy changes regarding
stopping rules, minimum participant thresholds) to ensure more diverse study populations in HIV research. The
proposed study will include three groups: a) BW enrolled in ongoing sociobehavioral research studies by
members of the mentoring team, LinkPositively (R34MH122014; PI: Stockman) and Women Shine;
(R01MH125785 PI Stockman) who agreed to be contacted about future research opportunities (n=40), b) BW
with histories of research participation who agreed to be contacted about future research opportunities, and those
seeking care at AIDS Clinical Trials Group clinical research sites without a history of research participation (n=65),
c) participated in LinkPositively (Grant #R34MH122014; PI: Stockman; n=70), an mHealth HIV intervention for
BWH in California and Oklahoma affected by interpersonal violence, c) Participants of the Enhanced Peer
Involvement in Care Amplifying the Voices of BW (EPIC) program embedded within existing peer navigation
programs in community-based organizations located in Ending the HIV Epidemic jurisdictions in the Southern
United States, and d) BW without HIV and with histories of research participation who agreed to be contacted
about future research opportunities and those seeking care at an HIV Vaccine Trials Network clinical research
site without a history of research participation (n=140). Next, we will qualitatively explore perceptions of and
facilitators and barriers to participation in HIV research among BW with and without HIV (Aim 2).The proposed
study, which is in response to PAR-22-172, will support the scientific investigation by underrepresented pre-
doctoral students, and is the first to attempt to quantify and contextualize the impacts of sociostructural inequities
and syndemics on BW’s willingness to participate in HIV research to inform multilevel efforts and interventions to
conduct equitable and diverse research."
10928709,"SUMMARY. Enzymatically-directed nucleotide modification is a key component of nucleic acid
processing and is used by all organisms to address a multitude of fundamental needs in
information transfer systems, including protection of DNA, translational fidelity, RNA stabilization,
and epigenetic regulation. In a remarkable example of the cross-talk between RNA and DNA
processing, we recently discovered that one of the most complex modification systems known to
occur in RNA, that responsible for the 7-deazaguanine modifications queuosine (Q) and
archaeosine (G+), is also utilized by diverse organisms for the modification of DNA. Indeed, in
Bacteria a set of roughly 10 proteins comprise an elaborate restriction-modification (RM) system
based on the formation of 2’-deoxy-7-cyano- and 2’-deoxy-7-amido-7-deazaguanosine (dPreQ0
and dADG, respectively) in DNA, and these nucleosides, as well as dG+ and 2’-deoxy-7-
aminomethyl-7-deazaguanosine (dPreQ1), have also been found in the DNA of phage and
archaeal viruses. Having identified the relevant proteins involved in the formation of 7-
deazaguanine based DNA modifications, we are now proposing to elucidate the molecular basis
for their function. The research described in specific aims 1 & 2 address the modification
machinery in bacteria, the proteins DpdA, DpdB, and DpdC, which together are responsible for
the formation of dPreQ0 and dADG, and serve as a model for 7-deazaguanine based modification
in DNA. In specific aim 3 we take a broader look at the DpdA family and consider systems that
lack DpdB and contain DpdAC fusions, as well as a phage DpdA in order to better understand
the need for the cryptic ATPase activity of DpdB in bacterial modification, and the structural basis
of sequence specificity in the bacterial and viral systems."
10929395,"ABSTRACT – Project 1
Project 1 will explore how photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be used for immunological priming in new
combination treatments for skin cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC), comprising squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), are the most common of all human cancers, representing a
significant healthcare burden (>3 million U.S. cases/year), with increased lethality for certain patient subsets,
e.g. organ transplant recipients. We showed previously that aminolevulinate (ALA)-based PDT can be effective
for NMSC patients, and that 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and Vitamin D (VitD) further improve treatment outcomes; yet
tumor clearance rates remain poor for large and advanced NMSC. To ameliorate this situation, we propose to
exploit the concept of photodynamic priming (PDP), a natural consequence of PDT. PDT triggers immunogenic
cell death, enhances influx of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and induces an adaptive anti-tumor immune
response, sensitizing the tumor microenvironment to the effects of immune checkpoint inhibition. Our
preliminary data show that a low-intensity PDT regimen can clear tumors in a murine SCC model,
accompanied by induction of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and recruitment of neutrophils,
macrophages and TILs, along with altered expression of immune checkpoint molecules such as PD-1. These
findings set the stage for a further combination approach using PDT and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). In
Aim 1 (preclinical) we will evaluate in murine SCC and BCC models the therapeutic response to various
combinations of PDT, 5FU, VitD, and ICI agents, and measure specific timing of TIL recruitment, checkpoint
molecule expression, and tumor clearance. In Aim 2 (clinical studies) we will determine the nature and timing
of immune responses in BCC and SCC patients, post-PDT. Tumors will be subjected to PDT (guided by Core
C dosimetry to measure photosensitizer levels); then after 1-to-14 days the tumor will be surgically excised and
analyzed for checkpoint molecule expression and intratumoral immune cell infiltration using the histological
immunoscore (IS; Project 3). Systemic T-cell activation in circulating blood will be measured in collaboration
with Project 2. Another arm of these studies will test effects of 5FU or VitD pretreatment of NMSC tumors upon
the magnitude of anti-tumoral immune responses. Aim 3 will feature exploratory studies to validate the IS
approach for measuring TIL recruitment in human SCC tumor models in vitro. In collaboration with Project 3
and Core B, 3D patient-derived tumor-immune organoids (PDIOs), consisting of stratified SCC cultures
admixed with PBMCs (lymphocytes) will be tested for differential immune cell activation following PDT using
cutting-edge hyperspectral optical cytometry techniques developed in Core B that can image multiple immune
markers simultaneously. Relevance and Impact: Overall, this Project will benefit patients by providing the
basis for a new approach that combines photodynamic priming, 5FU, VitD, and ICI immunotherapy to improve
treatment outcomes for difficult and advanced cases of NMSC."
10929398,"ABSTRACT - Project 2
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies and typically presents at
advanced stages. Progress in treating these cancers has been slow and has produced only very modest
increases in survival. One of the few positive developments has been the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors
(ICI) in the setting of PDAC with microsatellite instability (MSI). Unfortunately, MSI is uncommonly found in
these cancers. The goal of this project is to expand the usage of ICI to the majority of PDAC tumors by
stimulating the immune system via photodynamic priming (PDP) of the primary tumor, using the intravenous
photosensitizer Verteporfin which is activated by light delivered via an optical fiber delivered though a fine
needle into the tumor under endoscopic ultrasound or CT guidance. This initiates PDP, a process that
activates immune cell recruitment into the tumor and educates T-cells to mount a response against the
primary PDAC as well as peripheral metastasis. We had a patient in whom a pulmonary metastasis regressed
after PDP treatment of the primary cancer, without any additional chemotherapy or immunotherapy. In
addition, we were able to show an increase in tumor-directed T cells (responsive to ICI) in the peripheral
blood of another patient 72 hours after we administered PDP for pancreatic cancer. In Project 2, we will
perform a Phase II study using combination therapy with PDP (Veteporfin and red light) followed by ICI
(pembrolizumab). Aim 1 will assess this combination treatment in 25 patients with locally advanced or
advanced pancreatic cancer (oligometastasis), for its ability to increase overall and disease specific survival,
produce necrosis of the primary tumor and regression of metastatic disease; we will also monitor for any
toxicities. Dosimetry for PDP will be based on vascular perfusion of the tumor on CT scans as well as
fluorescence measurements from the buccal mucosa (with Core C), avoiding direct measurements in the
tumor which were found to be unreliable previously. Aim 2 will use a PDP radiometric index (found in residual
tumor after PDP) to predict response to ICI. The index is based on changes in tumor characteristics related to
the degree of inflammatory infiltrate that is reflected in tumor heterogenity. We will also use hyperspectral
fluorescence microendoscopy to evaluate lymphocytes from lymph nodes with metastatic disease
involvement (Core B), to determine if this correlates with the subpopulations found by flow cytometry. Finally,
Aim 3 will focus on PDP-stimulated immune cell changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes of our PDAC
patients, to determine if these changes correlate with post-PDP changes in lymphocyte sub-populations
observed after PDP in skin tumors (Project 1) that are known to be immune sensitive (squamous cell cancer)
and those that are not (basal cell cancer). Finally, in a group of 5 patients we will be sampling large metastatic
lymph nodes 3 days after PDP to assess the changes in immune cells, in order to determine whether ICI
responsive tumor directed T-cells will increase."
10929401,"The statistics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remain dismal despite advances in combination
chemotherapies. It is largely chemo and radiation resistant, and surgery, the only curative option, is available
to only ~20% of patients. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has brought hope but in PDAC even the modest
success (anti-PD1: Pembrolizumab) is limited to only 1-3% of patients displaying microsatellite instability. The
majority of tumors lack the immune infiltration necessary for effective ICI. Based on our data and the literature,
we hypothesize that Photodynamic Priming (PDP), a process that is a fallout of photodynamic therapy (PDT)
and our main research focus, alters the tumor microenvironment to sensitize it to enhance ICI therapy. PDP
induces immunogenic cell death and enhances tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) migration, augmented by
PDP-induced higher tumor permeability.. We capture this priming effect for designing a non-empiric approach
for a PDT-ICI combination. We are greatly helped in this by our recent innovation of hyperspectral imaging
capable, for the first time, of monitoring 6 biomarkers simultaneously in live tumor bearing animals; it allows us
to quantify TILs (and subsets) along with PD1/PD-L1 expression changes to generate an immunoscore (IS).
We posit that ICI administration will be most beneficial when the tumor has been PDP-stimulated to be the
“hottest” thus minimizing ICI dose and associated toxicities, similar to that observed for PDP-chemotherapy
combinations. The hypothesis will be tested in 3 aims. Aim 1 will identify, in orthotopic murine tumors, PDP-
dosimetry and optimal timing for IS modulation to establish the time for maximal benefits of anti-PD1 therapy
(increased survival, decreased metastasis) and increased tolerability. Aim 2, informed by aim 1, will use both
orthotopic and a bilateral subcutaneous PDAC murine model to determine abscopal effects of PDP-ICI
therapy. A comparison of optimally timed, single dose ICI therapy with multiple dosages along with a
comparison of single immune checkpoint blockade (anti-PD1) with dual blockade (anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1) will
also be established. Aim 3 will utilize patient derived tumor immune organoids (PDIO), to recapitulate
heterogeneity and evaluate the combination therapy outcomes. PDP induced IS will inform optimally timed
anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy guidance for PDIOs. Relevance and Impact 1) it sensitizes non-immune
responsive tumors to responsive ones and expands the eligible PDAC patients (currently only at 3%). 2) A
non-empiric approach is introduced. 3) Combined with imaging-enabled dose reduction of anti-PD1 it reduces
toxicities of immune drugs as reported with chemotherapy and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 4) It provides
a broad imaging platform for in vivo real-time multiple-marker information at cellular resolution and serves as a
general point-of-care tool by enabling simultaneous visualization of several molecular targets (e.g., tumor
immune cell phenotypes and cytokines/stromal/metabolic signatures) for designing new therapies for many
other diseases, and with potential to expand the use of fine needle aspirate biopsy for PDAC ICI dosimetry."
10929405,"ABSTRACT - CORE A
The current proposal takes a new direction of including immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy within the
existing P01 theme of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)-based combinations guided by molecular mechanisms and
imaging. The renewal application has been revised and each of the critique comments have been addressed
under introduction section and elaborated further under research strategy section. Infact, the theme is
photodynamic priming (PDP) of tumors to make them immune sensitive. This priming enables tumors that were
silent to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) sensitive at lower concentrations with increased efficiency and
tolerability. The P01 has a diversity of skills and geographical locations and the Administrative Core is essential
to ensure an integrated conduct, facile exchange of information and a coordinated use of resources for the
maximal utilization of institutional and NCI-supported resources. The budgets are very limited (average
~$150/year, ~ 50% of an average R01) and therefore the Core and its efforts at coordination of multiple sites,
quality control and project data become critical. An aspiration of the Program is to create an ethos for maximal
integration of the components to better serve this P01, the field of PDT, cancer research, training of the next
generation, clinical translation and the community at large. To this end, the PIs have brought together a team of
new and existing scientists and physicians who already collaborate enthusiastically. The Core also takes a
leadership role in mid-course correction as became necessary with clinical pancreatic cancer project in the last
cycle. In addition to the two broad functions of Scientific and Administrative coordination, the renewal application
retains the goals of career development, intellectual property (IP) development, and data sharing for this Core.
The scientific coordination will be maintained through a variety of mechanisms that will include regular intra- and
inter-Project/Scientific Core meetings (Zoom or in person). This Core will: a) perform monthly reviews and identify
obstacles; b) coordinate meetings with selected collaborators and key personnel; c) organize and follow up on
action plans; d) organize annual SAB meeting and core/project specific discussions; e) As resources permit,
achieve scientific enhancement by inviting speakers with larger perspectives on cancer therapeutics relevant to
the Program, but not directly in PDT. Technologies will get IP protection where appropriate using institutional
resources and find development partners consistent with one of the goals of the NIH Roadmap. In response to
the reviewers’ critiques, a succession plan and a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)is added instead of the Scientific
Advisory Group. The Core was viewed as successful in the past cycle. Specially noted strengths were career
development efforts, numerous joint publications and leadership. The aims were appreciated for clarity,
construction and for promoting better communications across all projects and cores. The revised proposal
addresses all the concerns expressed by the reviewers, notably the lack of a succession plan and the absence
of an explicit SAB, which are now included. We hope that the reviewers will now deem this Core superior."

The Biological Models, Multiplexed Optical Biopsy, Molecular Pathology, and Biostatistics Core, Core B,
integrates novel biological models with newly developed biochemical and imaging assay platforms to enable
the development of the treatments envisioned in the Program Projects. The objective of Core B is to provide a
service and research platform to increase the efficiency of microscopy, biostatistics and pathology techniques
used by all four Program Projects. Core B will also coordinate centrally communicating biostatistics and
pathological services to support experimental design and the interpretation of preclinical and clinical results.
Collectively, the Core aims to develop new flexible and scalable technologies for skin and pancreatic cancer in
partnership with the Program Projects to move the field further towards personalized and individualized
therapies by informing the timing of immune checkpoint inhibition. This could have a tremendous impact with
implications in the long run for customized, precision immune checkpoint inhibition treatments that maximize
efficacy while reducing toxicity. This research and development component of Core B will provide novel cancer
models and tumor imaging technologies for the advancement of the Program Projects. Core B is interactive
with all of the Program Projects and each Project will leverage Core B resources and services, as follows:
newly developed patient-derived in vitro organoid models from skin biopsies (Project 1) and pancreatic cancer
discarded surgical tissue (Project 3); previously established in vivo immunocompetent mouse models of skin
cancer (Project 1) and pancreatic cancer (Project 3); and, novel video multiplexed in vivo microendoscopy
(Projects 1, 2, and 3) that was developed and validated during the previous funding cycle. In addition, the Core
provides biostatistics and molecular pathology services to Projects 1, 2, and 3, with guidance from expert
biostatisticians as well as pathologists with expertise in skin and pancreatic cancer. The strong infrastructure at
MGH and the Mayo Clinic available at no costs makes this ambitious plan for Core B possible within the
minimal resources of the P01. The microscopy support includes unique hardware and software, with rigorous
validations, for hyperspectral multiplexing and this use of operational, custom-designed systems also
introduces not only unique capabilities but also cost savings compared to commercial solutions. Collectively,
Core B has the necessary infrastructure and personnel to maximize the success of the Program Projects in the
discovery of novel combination regimens for photodynamic priming of immune checkpoint inhibition with
potential to provide durable treatment outcomes and to improve quality of life for both skin and pancreatic
cancer patients."

The central goal of the core to service the projects with measurement tools that they can use to control the
individualization of treatment, and while they may be imperfect markers, they can provide guidance as to the
optimal way to have synergistic combination treatments. The individual physiologic variation in immune response
and PDT are both known to be at least as variable as responses from traditional broadband therapies such as
surgery, chemotherapy or radiation. This core develops technologies and imaging tools that provide either direct
measurement of dosimetry or surrogate biomarkers of response that would have clinical translation potential.
These tools will be able to help: i) control PDT dosimetry; ii) sample for physio-biologic tissue responses, and iii)
predict for synergy between PDT and immunotherapies. The work with Project 1 in dermatology focuses on
Imaging PDT dosimetry by measuring the 3 core parameters of PDT, including: (i) oxygen, (ii) photosensitizer,
and (iii) light, and surrogates and combinations of these. Imaging Oxygen from inherent PpIX delayed
fluorescence was demonstrated here the first time. This tool will be optimized and developed into a controlled
handheld tool for experimental deployment in the clinic. PpIX dosimetry innovation has advanced to allow
cellphone measurement of levels, and is deployed at all clinics with low cost and high usability. Immune invasion
and response imaging are exceptionally hard to visualize, but tools to provide surrogates of this are explored. In
Project 2, pancreatic adenocarcinoma PDT and PDP Response Imaging is continued with analysis of CT scans
and Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS). Established studies of tissue stiffness mapping with EUS elastography and
CT changes are used and imaging surrogate biomarkers of PDP effect by Radiomics has been completed, and
a Radiomic index hypothesized. In Project 3, preclinical tissue stiffness & collagen mapping in situ are developed
by UV fluorescence imaging of fresh tissue. This system will be used to iteratively determine how PDP changes
in PDAC can be related to the definition of a quantitative Radiomic index. The Core develops tools for these
projects and provides guidance on technology innovation and development as these are iterated on."

Currently available optical components limit biomedical imaging. In particular, in neurobiology, standard microscope
components limit the field-of-view and speed of imaging of neuronal activity. Through prior work on BRAIN
Initiative project, we have developed approaches for new optical components that expand the field-of-view 5 to 50
times over standard microscopes, with no loss in resolution, while retaining high imaging speed. In this project,
we will develop three new products to further impact this field, enabling better imaging systems, higher quality
data, and new experiments. The three products are: (Aim 1) a new long working distance air objective with high
resolution, (Aim 2) a high performance scan lens for large field-of-view imaging, and (Aim 3) an angle-doubling
module for large field-of-view imaging with no loss in scan speed. The company will perform the design studies
and development. The company will partner with the university lab to validate and evaluate the products in
state-of-the-art experiments. The results from this project will result in innovative new optical components that
will expand the field-of-view and throughput of imaging systems in neurobiology labs."

To understand the function and dysfunction of the brain it is necessary to confront its complexity. Over the past
two decades the field of neuroscience has leveraged the tremendous advances in electronics, genetics, and
microscopy to collect a bewildering amount of neuronal data, especially when compared to the state of the field
at the turn of the last century. More than ever these datasets require sophisticated analysis techniques to expose
the salient aspects of brain dynamics and computation. Of equal importance is building a coherent theory of
brain function. Theory can both organize these datasets under a conceptual umbrella, as well as suggest the
next series of experiments to be performed. These realities require more neuroscience researchers to be trained
in a variety of computational and mathematical techniques. This project outlines an ambitious graduate and
undergraduate Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) at the University of Chicago.
The University of Chicago TPCN has 31 training faculty distributed over 10 departments. The training faculty
are composed of 6 faculty in computational neuroscience (dry-lab), 9 training faculty whose laboratories are
primarily experimental, and 15 training faculty whose laboratories are both computational and experimental. At
the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Computational Neuroscience and a complementary PhD
program in Neurobiology. At the undergraduate level the University of Chicago has a highly popular Major in
Neuroscience, and students can Minor in Computational Neuroscience. The TPCN is set within a highly collegial,
cross-disciplinary environment of our Neuroscience Institute and the Grossman Center for Quantitative Biology
and Human Behavior. The Neuroscience Institute was established in 2014 to foster interdisciplinary research on
the neural mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 87 faculty having appointments in 16 departments.
The Grossman Center was launched in 2020 and is a space within the Neuroscience Institute with an explicit
focus on computational and theoretical neuroscience. Over the next five years the Grossman Center will grow
to house 5 computational neuroscience faculty to complement our already existing community of theoretical
neuroscientists. During this funding period the TPCN will (1) strengthen the course offerings in computational
neuroscience at both the graduate and undergraduate level; (2) create a undergraduate research program in
computational neuroscience; (3) enhance our minority recruitment by taking advantage of the undergraduate
neuroscience research program.
TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students take a series of directed courses in computational neuroscience that span both statistical and modeling approaches. To
ensure their competency in core neuroscience principles they also take courses in cellular, systems, and behavioral neuroscience. Their training will be supplemented with courses in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as
computer science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. All graduate students will have extended experience
in at least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the University
of Chicago Neuroscience community. Supported undergraduates take courses in mathematics, computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience or psychology and two
courses in Computational Neuroscience; and they complete a research project. In addition, they complete the
TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer program go through the boot camp on topics in
computational neuroscience, including tutorials in Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding; they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees
will receive training in responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA
graduate students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate school-year and 30 summer fellows."
10938828,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enhancers are non-coding regulatory elements that directly involved in modulating cell-type-specific gene
transcription. Dissecting enhancer function provides critical understanding of human phenotypes and diseases.
Current studies investigate enhancers by profiling one or few of their enhancer features, such as transcription
factor binding, histone modification, chromatin accessibility, non-coding mutation, enhancer transcription and
target gene interaction. To reach a comprehensive evaluation of enhancer function, dynamics, and importance
to human diseases, there is urgent need to jointly analyze enhancer features across human cell types. However,
key barriers exist towards the goal: data heterogeneity, missing enhancer profiles and lack of functional
evaluation consensus. Over the years, we have gained extensive experiences and skills in research areas
including sequence data quality control, machine learning algorithm development as well as enhancer functional
evaluation. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to develop and apply computational methods for analyzing
and interpreting gene regulation in human diseases. Here, we propose to leverage our experiences and skillsets
to develop computational methods in enhancer function dissection through integration of eight different genomic
features from hundreds of human cell types. Specifically, we will focus on three main areas in the next five years
to address the barriers. i) We will develop statistical methods to harmonize heterogeneous data across human
cell types so that sequencing quantification of enhancer features will be comparable and reflect valid enhancer
activities. ii) We will develop machine learning methods to fill the missing enhancer profiles for unmeasured cell
types by learning information from known enhancer profiles, DNA sequences and target gene expression. iii) We
will develop integrative strategies to build enhancer connectome (enhancer-enhancer and enhancer-promoter
interactions) and prioritize cell-type-specific importance of enhancers based on connectome topologies. The
findings from the proposed work will significantly advance our understanding of enhancer function and their

This continuation of an established training program seeks to prepare qualified M.D., Ph.D., and M.D./Ph.D.
candidates for academic careers in the field of allergy and immunology. Support is requested for eight
postdoctoral trainees having either a M.D. or Ph.D. degree or both. The training program emphasizes three
major areas: basic science, translational science, and clinical science. The trainees focused in basic science
learn techniques and concepts of immunopharmacology, immunochemistry, and cellular and molecular
immunology. Areas of emphasis include the basic biology of mast cells, lipid mediators, dendritic cells, innate
lymphoid cells, and animal models of allergic disease. Trainees in translational science paths incorporate
informatic approaches to analyze genetic, genomic, and unbiased sequencing or metabolomic data to
understand the mechanistic basis of human allergic diseases. Such trainees may also employ bench side
approaches to studies using human cells and tissues. Trainees in clinical sciences may focus on epidemiology
or clinical trials. The faculty are highly accomplished investigators with extensive mentoring track records and
substantial extramural grant support. The three-year research training period is designed so that each trainee
learns a range of techniques and approaches, gains a broad understanding of the innate and adaptive immune
host responses, and establishes a template for an early career research focus. This time frame also permits
the trainee, along with his or her mentor and Scholarship Oversight Committee, to plan for post-fellowship
career development, with the goal of defining a path in academia that is commensurate with the trainee’s
developing skills and interests. The research experience is enhanced by didactic course work, as well as
workshops in grant writing, manuscript composition, and lab management. The program continues to be highly
successful, with over 75% of the graduates in the past decade having full-time academic appointments, many
of whom are primarily research based with independent NIH support."

Categorization is a fundamental aspect of human cognition that allows for efficient learning, generalization, and
communication. Throughout development, humans categorize the objects, people, and events around them.
The proposed work examines social categorization with a focus on gender. Gender categories are early
emerging, yet influential throughout the lifespan. Broader societal ideas about gender appear to be changing,
however, and this grant asks how those changes may or may not be reflected in how adolescents are
categorizing gender, their beliefs about gender, and their self-categorization by gender. Using a pair of
longitudinal studies, including a 5-year annual study (ongoing from the previous grant period) and a month-long
daily experience sampling study, this grant will document how these constructs are or are not changing
amongst adolescents and the relation between these constructs and their social environments. Finally, in this
work, we examine the links between adolescents’ beliefs about gender, self-categorization with gender, and
their health and well-being. Participants include adolescents and adults who are gender diverse and cisgender.
Together this work will advance theory and practice about topics ranging from categorization and adolescent
gender development to reducing mental health disparities in transgender youth."

Cuyahoga Community College's (Tri-C) application to the National Institutes of Health's
Bridges to the Baccalaureate Research Training Program is being submitted with two
university partners, Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. The
continuing goal of Cuyahoga Community College's Bridges to Success in the Sciences
program is to increase the number of underrepresented students who complete their
science education at the community college level, transfer to and complete their science
education at a four-year institution. Tri-C's Bridges to Success in the Sciences Program
provides academic supports and activities designed to increase the success of
underrepresented minority students studying in biomedical and behavioral science fields.
Bridges will use a cohort model and specific research pathways for our students in the
program. This approach assures continuity of the research experience throughout the
students' participation in the Bridges program. Bridges students will be assigned to
Research Mentors from our partner four-year universities. Over the term of grant, 50
students will work in the lab of the Research Mentor for a minimum of 15 hours a week
during the academic year. Continuing summer research experiences will be available for all
50 Bridges students, working 25-30 hours in the labs of their assigned Research Mentors.
Students entering the Bridges program at Tri-C will be paired with an experienced Tri-C
Bridges Faculty Mentor who will advise the student and carefully monitor his/her academic
progress throughout their tenure in the program. Bridges students, who have transferred to
our four-year partner colleges, will be guided throughout their tenure by University
Pathway Coordinators. Transfer Bridges students at the four-year partner institutions will
also have a guarantee to receive either direct financial assistance through their Research
Mentors or university scholarships after finishing the Tri-C Bridges program and until they
graduate with their baccalaureate degree. In addition to typical course requirements,
Bridges students will be required to complete the developed BIO 1806 Introduction to
Research Methods course and a newly developed CURE (Course-based Undergraduate
Research Experience) class and continue to attend the “Laboratory Techniques and
Practices” seminar series. The seminar series will be integrated into the existing framework
of Bridges workshops, seminars and meetings, which provide additional training for
students and allow for discussion about program operations and additional efforts to better
meet the students' needs."

 This application will study a novel role of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol-glycan-specific phospholipase D
(GPLD1) in relation to physical activity (PA), cognitive outcomes, and relevant mediating pathways, including
inflammation, coagulation, mitochondrial indices and vascular remodeling in aging people with HIV (PWH).
Although PA promotes better cognitive function and quality of life in HIV, PA is problematic for many aging PWH
due to physical limitations from neuropathy, cardiopulmonary disease, and other conditions. Systemic GPLD1
was recently shown to recapitulate the neurogenic and cognitive benefits of exercise and may represent an
alternative approach to gain neural benefits of exercise for those with physical limitations. In an existing cohort
of 100 PWH (50 participating in a PA intervention and 50 controls), we will quantify how GPLD1 levels change
before and after the PA intervention and how these levels associate with plasma markers of inflammation,
clotting, vascular remodeling, mitochondrial indices and neurocognitive (NC) performance. We propose PWH
with higher levels of PA documented by Fitbit and accelerometer monitoring will show greater increases in
GPLD1 than those with lower PA. We hypothesize that higher GPLD1 at baseline will associate with improved
markers of inflammation, abnormal clotting, mitochondrial indices and vascular remodeling and that greater
increases in GPLD1 during the PA intervention will correlate with larger improvements in these indices.
Additionally, we expect that higher baseline GPLD1 will associate with better NC performance and that GPLD1
increases during the 6-month PA intervention will associate with improving NC performance. In addition to human
studies, we will perform translational work to evaluate mechanisms by which GPLD1 exerts salutary effects.
These will include studies in an animal model of virally suppressed PWH on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the
EcoHIV mouse model. In these animals, we will measure the effects of GPLD1 administration on cognition and
markers of inflammation and clotting, including evaluating if the beneficial effects of GPLD1 are blocked by an
inhibitor (phosphatidic acid). In addition, we will characterize inflammation, mitochondrial indices and
synaptodendritic integrity in brain tissue from GPLD1-treated mice. We expect GPLD1 treatment in EcoHIV mice
will improve behavioral performance, reduce brain tissue inflammation and improve synaptodendritic integrity
and mitochondrial indices. In service of future Phase 1 clinical trials, we will examine GPLD1 effects on liver
toxicity in mice. We will also evaluate neuronal cultures for GPLD1 effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and
neurogenesis by exposing cultures to plasma from humans in the PA intervention. We expect PWH plasma with
higher PA will stimulate hippocampal mitochondrial biogenesis and neurogenesis compared to lower PA, and
will determine if serum GPLD1 associates with these outcomes. Examining GPLD1 effects in PWH, our
translational design, and extension of prior works into brain mechanisms of GPLD1, including inflammation and
mitochondrial function, which is impaired by antiretroviral therapy (ART)-related neurotoxicity, are innovative."

Cell-cell communications among different cell groups, especially between the germline and somatic cells, are
key to the development of a functional egg. At the center of germline-soma interactions in the Drosophila
model lies the Notch pathway, which plays critical roles in a series of major events during oogenesis.
Determining how Notch signaling regulates diverse cellular processes is fundamental to the understanding the
regulation of oogenesis. On the other hand, the ovarian model offers an excellent platform to uncover novel
regulatory mechanisms of this notoriously important pathway, with roles crucial in development, tissue
homeostasis and pathogenesis of a multitude of human diseases. Despite many years of studies, there are still
a significant number of unknowns in the field. For example, how Notch regulates growth in different
developmental or pathological contexts, how the cell cycle machinery feeds back to modulate the Notch
pathway and how environmental stresses impact the signaling output during development and tissue
homeostasis. This proposal aims to address these questions using the genetically tractable Drosophila
ovarian model system.
 The proposed studies are based on a series of previous findings and preliminary results. We have
shown that Notch signaling induces cell differentiation by switching the follicle cells from the mitotic cycle to an
endoreplication cycle, thus restricting cell proliferation. Interestingly, when combined with a loss of cell polarity
gene lgl, we found that Notch promotes tissue growth in the follicle cell epithelium. We also found that String
(Stg), a Cdc25 homolog, regulates the nuclear access of an active form of Notch, the Notch intracellular
domain (NICD). Furthermore, we found that hyperactivation of Notch in follicle cells causes cell death and
degeneration of germline cells through phagocytosis. These findings provide us the opportunity to further
explore how germline and somatic development are coordinated during normal development and under
environmental stresses, and to understand how Notch signaling regulates growth and survival in various
biological and pathological conditions. The following three specific aims will be addressed using the ovarian
model.1. To determine how Notch regulates tissue growth in different genetic backgrounds. 2. To determine
how Cdc25/String regulates NICD nuclear access to impact Notch signaling. And 3. To determine how
upregulated Notch activity in follicle cells induces germline cell death. Successful completion of these aims will
lead to improved understanding of the diverse effects and regulatory mechanisms of Notch signaling during
development and tissue homeostasis. The findings from the proposed studies will help designing new
therapeutic strategies for diseases related to aberrant Notch signaling."

10906923,"LIM Domain Kinases: Regulation and Substrate Recognition
ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic cells interpret extracellular and intrinsic cues to effect remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, a process
critical for controlling cell morphology, movement, and invasiveness. Tight control of signaling pathways
impinging on the cytoskeleton is therefore essential to normal development and homeostasis. The RHO family
GTPases RHO, RAC and CDC42 each directly activate kinases (RHO kinases, PAKs, and MRCKs) in a spatially
restricted manner that in turn directly phosphorylate and activate the LIM domain kinases (LIMK1 and LIMK2).
These kinase signaling cascades ultimately converge on phosphorylation of the cofilin/ADF (actin-
depolymerizing factor) group of proteins, key molecules that mediate remodeling of actin filaments. Over the
previous two periods we have leveraged the highly complementary expertise of our two laboratories to provide
significant advances in two main areas: understanding the specificity and regulation of p21-activated kinases
(PAKs) and revealing the basis for selective targeting of cofilin by LIMKs. We will now target our efforts toward
answering outstanding questions that remain regarding regulation and function of LIMKs. Our preliminary data
suggest that an intramolecular interaction between a LIM-PDZ module and the kinase domain, potentially
involving evolutionarily conserved binding surfaces, is responsible for suppressing LIMK catalytic activity.
Combining biophysical, biochemical, and cell-based approaches, we will address the hypothesis that disruption
of this interaction results in activation of the LIM kinases, and we will reveal the structural basis for LIMK
autoregulation. We will further investigate recent evidence that LIMKs can phosphorylate both Ser and Tyr
residues by X-ray crystallography of LIMK-substrate complexes and molecular dynamics simulations. In this way
LIMKs will serve as a general model for understanding substrate recognition by the various “dual specificity”
kinase families. Finally, we will investigate the myotonic dystrophy related CDC42-binding protein kinases
(MRCKs), a major group of LIMK activating kinases downstream of the GTPase CDC42, about which little is
currently known. We will use structural, biophysical and biochemical approaches to define the basic architecture
of MRCKβ studies and to probe how its activation is coupled to interactions with LIMKs through substrate adaptor
proteins. Overall, our studies will provide a substantial advance in our molecular level understanding of signaling
pathways downstream of the RHO family GTPases that impinge on regulation of the actin cytoskeleton."

Low-cost air sensors offer tremendous opportunities for researchers and community members to better
understand air pollution exposures at neighborhood, indoor, and personal levels. Though these devices are
often marketed as easy-to-use, users face multiple technical challenges including maintenance, calibration,
data management, and data visualization. These issues often lead community members and researchers to
form community-academic partnerships within a community-engaged research (CEnR) framework. However,
successful community-academic partnerships require time and training to set expectations, identify team
member roles, develop team processes and shared mental models, and design a project that balances the
needs of a community with the expectations of academic researchers. In recognition of both the opportunities
and challenges of using low-cost sensors in CEnR, we propose an innovative program to foster successful
community-academic partnerships and equip research teams with the technical skills and knowledge to
successfully utilize low-cost sensors in environmental justice (EJ) communities. Our program, entitled
Research Innovations using Sensor Technology in Environmental Justice Communities (RISE Communities),
will accomplish three specific aims using a combination of in-person training, experiential learning, and a social
learning community. We will recruit community-academic teams (5 per year) from throughout the US and
provide dedicated time and training to build trust, set expectations, promote sustainability, and engage in
evaluation (Aim 1). In addition, experts in the use of low-cost sensors and their application in EJ communities
will provide in-person courses, workshops, and hands-on training in their use. This training will equip teams
with the requisite foundational knowledge in research methods employing low-cost sensors including how to
select the appropriate sensor(s) for their research questions, deploy them in their own communities, and
translate the data to action (Aim 2). Throughout the program we will cultivate a community of practice to
facilitate continued interaction among participants and program faculty and extend the learning beyond the in-
person training (Aim 3). Collectively, these aims address the urgent need in environmental health research for
successful community-academic partnerships to address disparities in air quality experienced by residents of
EJ communities. In addition, the RISE Communities program will promote the use of sensor technology in EJ
communities to encourage data-driven action to improve public health."
10907527,"There is a striking dearth of longitudinal studies of alcoholism ontogeny to mid-adulthood from earlier developmental periods. The extent to which heavy drinking in adolescence and early adulthood persists into later life, and the reasons for its progression to mid-adulthood when employment and family responsibilities are approaching the “ascendant” midlife phase, is vastly under-studied. This is particularly problematic considering that high-risk drinking has increased 37% and AUD 47% among 30-44 year olds. NIAAA has prioritized a developmental approach to the identification of mechanisms underlying alcohol misuse and problems and co- occurring mental health conditions across the lifespan (Goals 1-2, Objective 1a). Cross-sectional research suggests shifting mechanisms of vulnerability with age, from positive to negative reinforcement processes. The Pittsburgh ADHD Longitudinal Study (PALS) is uniquely suited to address these important questions for a high-risk population: adults with a childhood diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The PALS was designed to prospectively study the onset, course, and causes of AUD in a large cohort of children with ADHD -- an established risk factor for adolescent and young adult AUD. The sample is currently aging through their 30s with > 90% retention (360 ADHD, 224 nonADHD) and provides a unique opportunity to test hypotheses about changing mechanisms of AUD risk and recovery over a large age span, into the late 30s, without empirical precedent. We propose to capitalize on the current age of the PALS sample to take advantage of this opportunity, with a novel emphasis on understanding the intersection of impulsivity and mood as it relates to ADHD risk for AUD. In addition to a wealth of prospectively assessed self- and informant-reported variables collected longitudinally in the PALS, the proposed new, expanded assessments stretching into mid-adulthood will include an ecological momentary assessment protocol (EMA) and behavioral task indices of impulsivity. The proposed 20-day EMA burst embedded in the prospective longitudinal design will characterize the dynamic nature and temporal ordering of alcohol risk processes (e.g., shift in impulsivity) not captured in traditional assessments and will integrate environmental (e.g., interpersonal stress) and individual factors (e.g., negative mood, sleep disturbances) to which individuals with ADHD may be more sensitive. Coupled with integrated examination of etiological processes across important developmental windows (adolescence, young adulthood, mid-adulthood), the prospective, expanded assessments (at ages 35, 37, and 39, with a 20-day EMA at age 35 or 37) will enhance understanding of developmental processes in relation to worsening and improving course of heavy drinking and alcohol problems through mid-adulthood when life altering consequences become especially costly. Results hold promise for developing personalized medicine treatment targets that may be particularly efficacious for reducing AUD risk among adults with a history of ADHD."

This project proposes to develop and refine computational tools to advance the safety and efficacy of genome
editing, addressing the critical need for precise quantification and prediction of on- and off-target effects. Genome
editing technologies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment and prevention of disease by enabling
precise modifications to DNA sequences. However, their clinical application is currently limited by significant
challenges in detecting and avoiding off-target effects, as well as quantifying and understanding the
heterogeneity of on-target edits. In Aim 1, we will enhance the capabilities of our recently developed tool,
CRISPRme, which predicts off-target effects across diverse human genomes. We propose to develop a new
tool, CRISPRus, which will leverage variation graphs, complete genomes, and pangenomes to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of potential off-target effects. Aim 2 will focus on the characterization of complex
on-target editing outcomes. We will develop and refine tools to enable accurate quantification from long-read
and single-anchor sequencing methods. This will provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the
outcomes of genome editing, including the potential for complex, multi-site edits. In Aim 3, we will tackle the
statistical challenges inherent in quantifying genome editing events. We propose to develop DE-CRISPR, a
comprehensive framework that will provide simulations and statistical models to assess the significance of editing
events at the locus, repair-pathway, and individual allele levels. This will enable researchers to design
experiments with adequate power to detect editing events and to interpret their results with greater confidence
and precision. Accompanying these aims, we will produce comprehensive benchmark datasets, including of 6
editing approaches in 6 donors; comparing nuclease, base, and prime editing; comparing approaches across a
range of anticipated specificity; targeting primary clinically relevant cells of unknown genotype (a real-world
scenario) and cell lines with complete telomere-to-telomere genome assemblies described. The deliverables of
this project, a comprehensive toolkit of computational tools including CRISPRus, CRISPRessoPE, CRISPRuni,
CRISPRlungo and DE-CRISPR, will empower researchers to more safely and effectively harness the power of
genome editing technologies. This work is essential to ensuring the robustness and reproducibility of genome
editing, ultimately promoting the safety and efficacy of therapeutic development. By addressing current
limitations in genome editing off-target prediction, complex edit characterization, and statistical analysis, we aim
to keep pace with advances in genome editing technology and contribute to the realization of its full therapeutic
potential."

Returning to drive after an mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an immediate goal for many individuals as they
return to their daily activities. However, evidence-based guidance about when those with mTBI can safely
return to drive is lacking. While an mTBI can lead to significant cognitive and functional impairments, little is
known about how mTBI affects driving, especially among teen drivers who are at an increased risk of both
mTBI and motor vehicle collisions compared to other age groups. The long-term goal of this research is to
evaluate the effects of mTBI on teen's driving performance and inform clinical practice guidelines on when
teens can safely return to drive post-mTBI and under what conditions. We will test the following specific aims:
Aim1: Characterize the trajectory of driving from acutely post-injury to symptom resolution among teen drivers
with mTBI compared to healthy controls. Aim 2: Examine the effect of cognitive load on driving performance
from acutely post-injury to symptom resolution in teen drivers with mTBI compared to healthy controls. Aim 3:
Examine the extent to which differences in driving performance between teen drivers with and without mTBI,
especially under increased cognitive load, are mediated by acute post-injury neurocognitive function.
We will enroll 200 teen drivers ages 16-19 years from two study sites to increase racial, geographic, and
socioeconomic diversity. Participants will include 100 teen drivers (50 per site) with a physician-confirmed
isolated mTBI and 100 (50 per site) healthy controls with no history of TBI matched for age, sex, driving
experience, and athlete status. Primary driving outcomes will be assessed using two innovative,
complementary approaches: 1) high-fidelity driving simulators will be used to assess driving performance
under 4 experimental study conditions at up to 9 time points: acutely post-injury (≤ 96 hours of injury) and then
weekly until symptom resolution or 8 weeks post-injury, whichever occurs first; 2) self-report surveys of real-
world driving behaviors will be completed by all participants daily. This is the first study to longitudinally
evaluate teen driving after mTBI from acutely post-injury to symptom resolution. The study will fill critical gaps
by providing evidence on how increased cognitive load and underlying neurocognitive function post-injury may
impact driving performance. Our results will have a significant impact on clinical practice and guidelines by
providing evidence to inform the development of clinical return to drive guidelines, and to help healthcare
providers make informed clinical recommendations regarding when a teen can safely return to drive after
mTBI."
10909236,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Antitumor immune responses require a functional repertoire of innate and adaptive immune cells. Glioblastoma
(GBM), however, harbors a profoundly immunosuppressed microenvironment, particularly its T cell ignorance
caused by bone marrow sequestration; T cell exhaustion caused by immune checkpoint molecules on the
surface of T cells that suppress T cell function; and impaired memory T-cell responses. Unfortunately, efforts to
target the immunosuppressed GBM microenvironment with systemic immunotherapies have not produced
meaningful impact in clinical trials. Localized viral treatments have also been investigated for GBM and, while
these viruses elicit an anti-tumoral immune response, these treatments have also failed to impact survival in
clinical trials. To address these limitations, we have investigated intratumoral delivery of a replicating retrovirus
expressing RLI, which encodes an interleukin-15 fusion protein that enhances CD8+ and CD4+ naïve and
memory T-cell proliferation, as a therapeutic strategy free of the toxicities of systemic treatments targeting the
tumor microenvironment. We demonstrated that replicating retroviral delivery of RLI prolonged survival of
immunocompetent mice with intracranial gliomas using multiple different models. Here, we will build upon our
data by investigating our central hypothesis that intratumoral RLI immunomodulatory gene therapy can be
potentiated by adding other immunomodulatory strategies, incorporating immunogenic cell death, or targeting
resistance mechanisms. We will investigate our hypothesis through four specific aims: (1) Potentiate RLI
immunomodulatory gene therapy by enhancing T-cell mobilization, co-stimulation, and memory; (2) Determine
if targeting checkpoint pathways potentiates retroviral RLI immunomodulatory gene therapy; (3) Enhance RLI
immunomodulatory gene therapy by incorporating immunogenic cell death; and (4) Identify and target
glioblastoma-expressed proteins that counteract retroviral RLI immunomodulatory gene therapy. Our pursuit of
these aims will utilize novel technologies developed by our lab such as our binary retroviral system to deliver a
large payload of immunomodulatory genes and our retroviral compact Cas13d RNA-targeting CRISPR to target
resistance mechanisms. We will combine these innovative approaches with cutting-edge technologies such as
CyTOF to characterize the effects of RLI-based retroviral therapies on the full cohort of innate and adaptive
immune responses; customized CRISPRi libraries; paired immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice strains
to isolate immunologic resistance mechanisms; and single cell sequencing to profile T-cell subsets altered by
these therapies. These studies will develop our novel localized RLI retroviral immunotherapy in a manner that
addresses the spectrum of mechanisms creating local and systemic immunodeficiency in GBM by accounting
for T-cell ignorance and exhaustion, and identifying and targeting tumor cell and immune cell-driven resistance
mechanisms before they evolve. In doing so, we will validate our hypothesis regarding the impact of RLI-based
immunomodulatory gene therapy on GBM, a novel strategy with significant translational potential."

Urinary Stone Disease (USD) is an increasingly prevalent and highly recurrent condition associated
with major morbidity at a rising cost to society. Thus, improved management can significantly reduce
its health burden. Increasing fluid intake is recommended to all USD patients. However, knowledge
gaps persist regarding the impact of fluid therapy in preventing USD recurrence including
effectiveness of strategies to achieve and maintain a high urine volume, and whether such strategies
reduce USD recurrence. The Prevention of Urinary Stones with Hydration (PUSH) study is a
randomized clinical trial investigating the impact of increased fluid intake and increased urine output
on the recurrence rate of USD in adults and children. In this study 1,642 participants will be
randomized to a control or intervention arm. Participants in both arms receive a “smart water bottle”.
The intervention arm involves an additional program of behavioral interventions, including financial
incentives, structured problem solving, and low touch interventions designed to improve adherence to
a prescribed fluid intake regimen. The primary endpoint is occurrence of a stone event during a two-
year observation period. The PUSH study is in its third year, and due to multiple challenges to
recruitment of study participants, follow-up of participants and data collection have not yet been
completed. Additional time is needed to ensure study completion and to accomplish all study goals.
Although ureteral stenting is routinely performed after urological procedures for USD to mitigate peri-
operative complications, stents cause significant patient discomfort. The causal mechanisms are only
partly understood. The STudy to Enhance uNderstanding of sTent-associated Symptoms (STENTS)
is a prospective observational cohort study enrolling adolescents and adults undergoing
ureteroscopic intervention for ureteral and/or renal stones. Participants undergo detailed symptom
assessment using validated questionnaires, a psychosocial assessment, quantitative sensory testing
for evaluation of pain sensitization, and detailed collection of clinical and operative data.
Biospecimens (blood and urine) are being collected for future research. Recruitment to the STENTS
study and follow-up of the participants are expected to be completed on time. However, additional
time and resources are needed for analysis of collected study data. In Aim 1 of this application, the
investigators will continue and complete participant enrollment for the PUSH study, continue
biospecimen collection for the NIDDK Repository, analyze the data, and prepare and submit several
planned manuscripts related to the study hypotheses. In Aim 2 of this application, the investigators
will analyze the data from the STENTS studies, interpret findings, and disseminate findings through
peer reviewed publications."
10939951,"Abstract. Neuroactive steroids (NAS) such as allopregnanolone (ALLO) are synthesized in the brain from
progesterone (P4) and exert potent anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, and hypnotic effects on behavior.
Consistent with this, NAS have been approved as the first treatments to alleviate postpartum depression. NAS
are believed to exert their efficacy as positive allosteric modulators (PAM) of GABAARs, leading to acute
elevations in the magnitude of phasic and tonic inhibition. In addition to this, we have demonstrated that NAS
promote the insertion of GABAARs into the neuronal plasma membrane, leading to selective and sustained
elevations in tonic inhibition. Likewise, NAS promote cell survival and tubulin stability independent of their
efficacy as GABAAR PAMs. One explanation for these pleiotropic effects is that they are mediated by specific
NAS receptors. Consistent with this, studies in yeast, fish and mammalian cell lines have demonstrated that P4
and NAS bind to a family of putative membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) with 5 members - ɑ, β, γ, δ and
ε - that share homology with classic serpentine G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Intriguingly, some mPR
isoforms are highly expressed in the brain, suggesting they maybe of significance as effectors for NAS; however,
it remains to be established whether mPRs are bona fide metabotropic receptors for NAS. Likewise, their role in
mediating the effects of NAS neuronal excitability has yet to be evaluated due to a lack of suitable
pharmacological tools. Here we will examine the role that mPRs play in mediating NAS signaling in the DG a
domain of the hippocampus that predominantly expresses mPRɑ , and δ with lower levels of ε. To do so we will
first assess whether exposure to NAS of clonal cell lines expressing these mPRs modulates cAMP signaling and
PKC activity, accepted effectors for GPCRs. Using mice in which the expression of individual mPR isoforms has
been ablated using conditional and constitutive gene editing, we will evaluate their roles in mediating the effects
of NAS on neuronal excitability. Preliminary studies have allowed us to formulate an overarching hypothesis;
NAS exert metabotropic effects on the magnitude of tonic inhibition of mPRδ and mPRɑ, which in turn
signal via distinct effectors to increase and decrease the magnitude of tonic inhibition respectively, a
process that mediates the sustained effects of NAS on neuronal excitability. Our study will focus on the
following aims. Aim 1. To test the hypothesis that NAS exert pleiotropic effects on intracellular signaling via the
activation of distinct mPRs. Aim 2. To test the hypothesis that mPRδ selectively contributes to metabotropic
effects of NAS on tonic inhibition. Aim 3. To test the hypothesis that chronic activation of mPRδ increases tonic
inhibition and modifies the subunit composition of extrasynaptic GABAARs. Aim 4. To test the hypothesis that
NAS limit the magnitude of tonic currents via activation of mPRɑ. Collectively our study will provide the first
insights into how NAS induces long-lasting effects on neuronal excitability, information that may ultimately aid
the development of new strategies to improve mental health."

complex three-dimensional landscapes to hone to new destinations. Cell migration events are at the root of
many processes including embryonic tissue morphogenesis, immune cell surveillance, and cancer cell
metastasis. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of how the plasma membrane is organized to orient cell migration
is necessary for our appreciation of the basic principles of cell migration and for the identification and treatment
of aberrant cell migration during human development and disease.
 While significant work has deciphered the adhesion, signaling, and mechanical proteins underlying
migratory behaviors, we know far less about how individual lipids, and the biophysical properties they contribute
to the membrane, regulate migratory behaviors. Research in our laboratory interrogates the role of lipid
metabolism in regulating cell signaling, in vivo migration, and membrane fluidity with the ultimate goal of
identifying new strategies to modulate aberrant cell migration during development and disease. We use the avian
neural crest cell population as an ideal in vivo model to address these previously inaccessible questions due to
their robust and synchronous migratory behavior, the ease by which they can be manipulated and visualized in
vivo and measured for biophysical properties.
 Under this award we will answer the questions 1) how does membrane fluidity orient in vivo cell migration,
and 2) how do cells regulate local membrane fluidity? We hypothesize that migrating cells undergo active lipid
metabolism at the plasma membrane to tune local membrane fluidity, and that the organization of relative fluidity
orients cell migration by positioning receptor proteins necessary for chemotaxis. We will test these hypotheses
using in vivo and ex vivo live cell imaging, optogenetic approaches to locally alter membrane fluidity and protein
localization, measuring transmembrane receptor protein diffusion rates, and performing targeted gene
knockdown and mis-localization experiments. These projects will yield high-impact discoveries that shed new
light on how to prevent cancer metastasis, improve wound healing and inflammation responses, and correct for
atypical tissue morphogenesis. In addition, these experiments will reveal new directions for our lab as we
continue to decipher how plasma membrane organization regulates cell signaling and migration."

Regenerative abilities vary significantly both between different species and between distinct tissues of a
given species. Despite recent advances, many fundamental questions persist regarding the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that govern effective tissue regeneration. This research program strives to
uncover the genes and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that operate within individual cells during
distinct phases of regeneration. For regeneration to occur, surviving cells need to launch a response that
promotes localized cellular reprogramming, proliferation, and tissue repatterning to replace what was
lost. This investigation will shed light on how tissue regeneration is orchestrated by determining the genes
and GRNs that trigger a regenerative response, support regenerative growth, and ultimately reestablish
proper cell fates in the newly generated tissue. The work focuses on tissue regeneration in the powerful
genetic model organism Drosophila melanogaster in combination with state-of-the-art single-cell
technologies. Many crucial processes during regeneration occur in small subpopulations of cells, the
study of which has been revolutionized by single-cell technologies. Investigating regeneration in
Drosophila provides many key advantages including the availability of powerful genetic tools that support
dissection of gene function in vivo, large-scale screens for genetic interactions, and quantitative
assessments of regenerative growth, and repatterning. The goals in the coming years are to: (i)
investigate blastema formation and the establishment of the regenerative microenvironment. What are
the cellular and molecular events that activate, sustain, and organize cell-cell coordination during the
early phase of regeneration? (ii) elucidate the genes and GRNs that drive the distinct phases of
regeneration by unraveling gene regulatory mechanisms of the transcriptional programs activated during
the key phases of regeneration: blastema formation, regenerative growth, and regenerative repatterning;
(iii) compare tumorigenesis versus regeneration to uncover critical regulatory mechanisms. Tumors have
been shown to co-opt pro-regenerative GRNs to drive tumor growth. Therefore, we aim to discover the
regulatory mechanisms that effectively terminate regenerative growth by contrasting tissues undergoing
regeneration versus tumorigenesis. Together these areas of research will advance our understanding of
cell-type specific gene regulatory networks that initiate blastema formation, promote effective
regenerative growth, and regulate cellular repatterning during regeneration. These insights will address
central questions in the fields of developmental and regenerative biology and ultimately contribute to the
pioneering field of regenerative medicine."

Transcription factors (TFs) recognize specific DNA sequences and recruit coregulators including chromatin
modification enzymes to direct gene expression. The human nuclear receptor (NR) family includes 48 TFs that
play crucial roles in a number of biological processes including metabolism, reproduction, and inflammation.
The NRs share a highly disordered N-terminal domain (NTD), and two folded domains: a DNA-binding domain
(DBD) and a C-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD), connected by a small unstructured hinge region. Despite
numerous studies focusing on the individual LBD and DBD, how ligands elicit full-length NR activities remains
elusive with massive knowledge gaps in the roles of NTD and allostery between DBD and LBD. The long-term
goal of the laboratory is to develop the molecular-level understanding of the mechanism underlying the NR
transcriptional activity. We will use mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as an exemplary member in this proposal.
MR is highly expressed in the renal distal nephron epithelial cells and plays critical roles in fluid and electrolyte
homeostasis. It is also expressed in non-epithelial tissues such as heart, vasculature, brain, adipose and liver
tissues. Overactivation of MR in these tissues leads to increased inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress.
MR antagonist have shown great promise as therapies for cardiovascular and renal disease. However, their
development is severely lagging compared to others targeting MR homologs such as glucocorticoid, androgen
and estrogen receptors. Detailed studies of each domain, including the least understood, intrinsically
disordered NTD, and how these domains cooperate with each other in the full-length MR is highly required for
the deeper understanding of MR activity regulation. The focus of this proposal will be on: 1) determine how
NTD and hinge region regulate MR transcription by forming biomolecular condensates and 2) determine how
the interdomain and intradomain allostery tune the MR-mediated transcription. An integration of biophysical
approaches with structural biology and phase separation studies, as proposed here, is essential to decipher
this highly dynamic and disordered system. While being fundamentally important to our understanding of MR
activity controlling gene transcription, our results can guide the future development of MR antagonist targeting
various diseases caused by dysfunctional MR activities."
10928156,"):  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is clinically approved for treatment of epilepsy resulting in an average decrease in seizure frequency of 40%, but few patients achieve seizure freedom. Implantable neural stimulators have many parameters, such as stimulation amplitude, frequency and pulse width, which could potentially be tuned to improve efficacy. However, there is no systematic process to guide epileptologists through optimization. Stimulation of ANT in animal models has shown almost immediate changes in excitability in the loop of Papez, which we hypothesize is a biomarker that could be used to optimize stimulation parameters. Medtronic’s DBS Percept system allows for recording during stimulation and streaming the data to a computer for further analysis, which can be used in an optimization loop. Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a machine learning algorithm that is widely used for efficient optimization over a bounded parameter range when acquiring data is expensive and computational time is relatively cheap. We have used BayesOpt for optimizing stimulation settings in animal models and clinical trials. Here we propose to develop an optimization platform where stimulation settings are programmed by a physician using recommended settings from a BayesOpt algorithm to minimize power measured from the patient’s thalamus in the clinic using Percept. Three aims are proposed to develop, test, and validate this approach in an exploratory clinical trial. Aim 1: Develop and test BayesOpt clinical interface with hardware in the loop system. Aim 2: Apply BayesOpt to 20 epilepsy patients treated with the Percept system in a clinical setting to optimize stimulation settings to minimize thalamic activity. Aim 3: Validate optimized settings at home by programming patients with optimized setting and their physician selected setting to test if seizure frequency or power spectral density is significantly lower in the optimized setting. The outcome of this clinical trial will be to establish safety and feasibility of optimization and validation. If successful, this study will be used to power a phase II efficacy trial. The broader impact of this work is that this platform could be used to tune the Percept system, based on different biomarkers, in other diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, pain, and depression."

There is an urgent need to address the current public health crisis of opioid abuse and overdose deaths through
development of effective treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) and non-addictive therapeutics to manage
pain. Ultimately, achievement of these goals would be greatly facilitated by the existence of novel ex-vivo models
that recapitulate key features of neurobiology underlying the addictive process using human cells and advanced
imaging systems that can monitor the interactions between multiple neurotransmitter actions driving opioid
responses and reward pathways. This proposal aims to develop new technologies to create such ex-vivo models
and imaging systems, aiming at probing dynamic behaviors within the models at high spatial and temporal
resolution. Aim 1 will focus on recapitulating neuronal pathways in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus
acccumbens core (NAc), which have long been recognized to form the basis of substance abuse disorders.
Specifically, we propose an additive manufacturing approach based on 3D bioprinting of human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to establish 3D cultures within brain-mimetic scaffolds. Moreover, use of an
innovative, self-healing biomaterial as a printing medium and 3D culture scaffold enables “stitching” of unique
neuronal tissues constructs into integrated, yet regionally defined, complex networks. For example, we propose
to integrate tissue modules representing the GABAergic/dopaminergic circuitry of the VTA with tissue modules
representing the GABAergic medium spiny neurons on the NAc. In addition, these tissue-engineered networks
are optically transparent and easy to image, making them great models to study neural networks driving opioid
responses and reward pathways. In Aim 2, we will separately develop a TIRF (Total Internal Reflection
Fluorescence) microscopy technique to probe agonist-dependent dimerization of MOR (human µ-opioid
receptor) at the single-molecule level and a hyperspectral and lifetime imaging system to monitor the dynamics
of dopamine, GABA, glutamate and Ca2+ simultaneously. Together, these new imaging methods will enable
dynamic monitoring of the effects of opioids, and other small-molecule therapeutics, on the neuronal circuitry
underlying addictive processes. Overall, we expect these technological innovations to provide crucial tools for
development of new therapeutics which can effectively combat the opioid crisis."

Seasonal influenza caused an estimated 48.8 million illnesses, 22.7 million health care visits, 959,000
hospitalizations, and 79,400 deaths in 2017-18. Influenza is a particularly complicated disease to prevent as
the influenza virus itself changes over time, and unlike vaccinations for measles or hepatitis B, the
effectiveness of annual vaccination may be limited if the particular strain that appears in an outbreak is not
represented in the vaccine. In addition, the immunity produced by vaccination declines over time, and many
individuals, especially the elderly, may lose protection toward the end of an influenza season.
The goals of iMPH: Influenza Modeling for Public Health are to bring together four experienced modeling
groups including the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory (PHDL) that has significant experience as a MIDAS
Center of Excellence in the agent-based modeling of influenza, the Pittsburgh Vaccine Research Group
(PittVax), vaccine policy experts who are site leads in both the inpatient and outpatient CDC influenza vaccine
effectiveness (VE) networks, the DELPHI (Developing the Theory and Practice of Epidemiological Forecasting)
group at CMU, the most accurate US influenza prediction group, and the current MIDAS Network Coordination
Center (MCC) that brings major data and model coordination expertise.
Our specific Aims are to create realistic, biologically based models of influenza, including the development and
maintenance of immunity over time through either the development of the disease or vaccination so that we
can test the benefit of different prevention strategies in seasonal or pandemic influenza. Specifically, we will
examine strategies such as: enhanced vaccines that create high initial antibody levels, the addition of a
second, mid-season vaccine, or potentially delaying vaccination in some individuals until later in the season.
We will also examine the effectiveness of vaccination policies over a multi-year time, such as different
vaccinations for individuals who have had previous influenza, and consideration of every-other year vaccines,
Finally we will examine community-level interventions, such as school closures and working from home to
impact the spread of influenza over a season.
As a CDC Influenza Modeling Center, we will also collaborate with other centers to develop rapid responses to
current influenza threats, to share data, models and results to provide higher confidence to the CDC that
model-based recommendations can be used to formulate local, state and national influenza policy."

 The success rate of smoking cessation without any form of assistance is less than 10%, and rates are
even lower among African American (AA) smokers (3.3%), who suffer worse health consequences. Therefore,
it is critical to have interventions that particularly take AA smokers’ needs into account. Mobile health (mHealth)
technology, a growing area of healthcare, shows promise in smoking cessation, and can be used to augment
traditional smoking cessation treatment options such as pharmacotherapy or counseling. However, studies on
culturally adapted mHealth interventions for AA smokers are lacking. More research is needed to determine
how to make mHealth interventions more appealing to users and increase uptake by culturally adapting
features such as contents type and delivery, design features, and other engaging elements.
 The goal of the proposed project is to develop the prototype of a mHealth application (app) for smoking
cessation with features that are culturally adapted for AA smokers. The project will be successfully conducted
under two aims: 1) Determine optimal content and design features of mHealth apps for smoking
cessation are most preferred by adult AA smokers. I will develop and refine a list of preferred mHealth
content and design features from the literature through focus groups with AA smokers. I will use feedback from
the focus groups to conduct a discrete choice experiment (DCE) with hypothetical apps created with preferred
content and design features to further refine the list based on level of importance. 2.) Apply user-centered
design to develop a prototype of a mHealth app with content and design features rated as most
preferred by AA smokers, followed by formative evaluation by end-users to ultimately develop final
design specifications. I will develop the prototype (revisable version) of the mHealth app using a prototyping
software. I will then conduct formative evaluation to evaluate workflow, user experience and perceived usability
in an iterative manner with revisions and then create a set of documents with page for all components of the
app and flowcharts which will be used to communicate with developers for the final product.
 The proposed research and training will propel me toward my career goal of becoming an independent
scientist mHealth interventions, with a focus on health equity by developing expertise in nicotine addiction and
cessation science, experimental designs such as discrete choice methodology, user-centered design with
cultural adaptation and the development of mHealth interventions for AA smokers. This proposal is responsive
to NIDA’s commitment to health equity and to developing new treatments for substance use disorders.
Findings from this study will prepare me to conduct a future large-scale randomized trial comparing the new
mHealth app versus a generic app such as QuitGuide."

 Efferent feedback—a hallmark of peripheral sound coding—plays a critical role in auditory
development and plasticity and offers a potential mechanism for minimizing noise-induced cochlear
synaptopathy and supra-threshold perceptual deficits. However, our knowledge of how efferent

understand the development of medial efferent mechanisms in humans and their involvement in
auditory development. The objective of the proposed project is to systematically investigate the

exhibit developmental changes in efferent effects as a result of developmental plasticity in the
brainstem. Our rationale is that detailed knowledge of how efferents work and develop will lead to a

A major challenge for the cancer genomics community is determining which somatic mutations are contributing
to tumorigenesis, which are “passenger” (neutral) mutations, and which mutations will inform personalized
treatment decisions. Unfortunately, most functional studies of cancer mutations have largely ignored the impact
of altered RNA processing even though this alteration is widespread in cancer, and is a mechanism of both
oncogenesis and therapeutic resistance. We hypothesize that we are missing critical information about cancer
gene alterations when not considering isoform-specific functions and this is likely to affect cancer treatment.
Given the breadth in the lack of understanding of isoform-specific cancer gene function, high-throughput
approaches are vitally needed to identify cancer gene isoform variants and functionally characterize their effect
on cancer development and treatment. Aim 1 of this study will generate a compendium of human pan-cancer
gene isoform variants by performing long-read transcriptome sequencing on a panel of cancer cell lines and
primary lung tumors to build a comprehensive set of allele-specific, full-length transcript isoforms. Aim 2 will
identify gene isoform variants associated with resistance or variable response to targeted therapies in
patient-derived specimens and xenograft models. Aim 3 will perform high-throughput in vitro and in vivo
functional characterization of these isoforms driving oncogenesis and drug resistance with and without somatic
mutation to identify isoform-specific variant function. All of these aims will focus on genes in the RAS-RTK
pathway since this is the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway and contains many targetable genes.
Completion of this study will revolutionize our understanding of isoform-specific functions of cancer genes and
their contribution to oncogenesis and cancer treatment. Our approach will provide the cancer research
community with a much-needed framework and methodology for other cancer studies and will provide critical
insight into mechanisms of tumor response and resistance to cancer therapies."

More than 790,000 patients undergo mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure (ARF) in the United
States each year at a cost of $27 billion. The in-hospital mortality for these patients is nearly 35%, and for
patients with critical illness, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality can approach 50%.
In some patients, guideline-appropriate care with lung-protective ventilation or prone positioning will save lives,
yet in many others, an individualized treatment is elusive. There is a need for advances in leveraging
opportunities in data science to improve outcomes from respiratory failure. The primary method for generating
new evidence is the randomized clinical trial (RCT). Yet they are often costly, take many years, and can be
slow to accelerate learning and implementation at the bedside. In addition, RCTs usually enroll a moderate
number of patients at high cost (100 to 1000s) and measure a limited range of covariates (10 to 100s). Thus,
they do not lead to prediction of highly individualized treatment effects, as called for by the NHLBI Working
Group on Research Priorities.
In contrast, real-world evidence from electronic health records (EHRs) includes many patients (often millions)
and covariates (often 1000s). They are inherently generalizable, less costly, and less timely to acquire than
conducting RCTs. However, the estimation of treatment effects from EHR data is often biased due to
confounding, which occurs when a treatment and its effect(s) are both causally influenced by one or more
events. This project uses two Specific Aims to solve these challenges. Aim 1 proposes to develop and evaluate
a new method for making individualized predictions of treatment effects using data from RCTs and EHRs. It
uses “embedded” RCTs in which the clinical trial occurs within the context of usual care of a health system.
The embedded RCT data are applied to control for confounding when using EHR data to predict treatment
effects. Aim 2 will apply these methods to two embedded RCTs at UPMC that are studying treatments that
may help prevent ARF. The OPTIMISE C-19 trial is studying monoclonal antibody therapy for non-hospitalized
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The PeriOp trial will be studying perioperative interventions to improve
post-operative outcomes after major surgery. The hypothesis to be investigated is that the proposed new
methods will predict the effects of treatment on acute respiratory failure and other outcomes more accurately
than will using the clinical trial or the EHR data alone. Such results would provide support that these methods
yield individualized predictions of treatment effects that can inform clinical care to help prevent ARF."

This project aims to determine the chemical mechanisms of lipid peroxidation in membranes. The accumulation
of lipid peroxides on cellular membranes is a process that accompanies aging, as well as a host of age-related
diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and heart diseases. More recently, it was discovered that
lipid peroxidation leads to a programmed cell death, called ferroptosis, which may provide the connection
between lipid peroxidation and diseases. Despite their fundamental role in aging and health, the mechanistic
nature of lipid peroxidation and its connection to the diseased state in cells remain elusive. This may be because
lipid peroxidation studies are usually carried out in live cell context, where quantitative measurements are
difficult, or with lipids in organic solvents, where it lacks biological relevance. There are two important questions
with respect to lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis: one is which of the two fundamentally different pathways,
enzymatic peroxidation or non-enzymatic autoxidation involving free iron, is responsible for the membrane lipid
peroxidation in cells. The other is how lipid peroxidation leads to ferroptosis and other adverse cellular outcomes.
To investigate these problems, we will develop a membrane-based assay for quantitative measurement of lipid
peroxidation. By using surface-selective fluorescence microscopy to detect the generation of lipid peroxides, we
will elucidate chemical mechanism of lipid peroxidation in the membrane context. We hypothesize that both the
enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways are important in efficient lipid peroxidation, as they play different roles
in the process: the enzyme, lipoxygenase, initiates peroxidation with the selective binding for lipid substrates.
Then, after a critical amount of lipids have been oxidized, membrane structural disintegration allows iron-
catalyzed propagation of further peroxidation. We will test this hypothesis by directly measuring the rate of lipid
peroxidation in membranes under enzyme-driven and autoxidative conditions. We further hypothesize that lipid
peroxidation inflicts a chemical damage to membrane proteins, and the impairment of their function leads to
cellular death. To test this hypothesis, we will evaluate the structural and functional impact of lipid peroxidation
on Ras, an important signaling protein that is known to be sensitive to oxidative damage. The results of this study
will provide a better understanding of lipid peroxidation, which underlies many age-related health concerns and
therapeutic strategies to combat them."

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, as the incidence of breast cancer has
increased annually by 3.1% over the past three decades. Though mammography may detect breast cancer early,
its application
is often limited by overdiagnosis and increased cost. To overcome the limitations, risk prediction
and population stratification are needed to identify women likely to benefit from breast cancer mammography
screening. Thus,
identifying sensitive yet robust biologically relevant risk markers for risk prediction and
population stratification is a pressing need to ultimately reduce breast cancer disease burden. An intact DNA
repair is essential in breast tissue due to the extensive remodeling of the tissue throughout a woman's life.
Experimental evidence provides strong support for homologous recombination repair (HRR), a major DNA repair
pathway responsible for repairing DNA double-strand breaks, in guarding against mammary cell tumorigenesis.
A classic example is that major high- and moderate-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes (e.g., BRCA1,
BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM, PALB2, and RAD51D) are key players in HRR. Therefore, suboptimal HRR capacity may
lead to an increased accumulation of DNA damage and an elevated risk of breast cancer. However, due to the
lack of tools to measure HRR capacity non-invasive, such assumption has not been tested in the non-familial or
unselected setting. Recently, we developed a phenotypic assay to measure HRR capacity in peripheral blood
lymphocytes (PBLs). Our assay can provide a readout of the efficiency of the multiple steps of HRR in surrogate
tissue, which is critically needed for population studies. In our preliminary breast cancer study, we found that
HRR capacity was significantly lower in cases than in controls (P<0.001), and decreased HRR capacity was
associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Our primary goal is to fully assess the role of HRR in PBLs
in breast cancer development by taking advantage of the rich resources from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) cohort. We will first carry out a nested case-control study to validate
HRR capacity in PBLs as a breast cancer risk factor overall and by subtypes. Then, we will evaluate the impact
of suboptimal HRR in PBLs on breast tumorigenesis by
evaluating
suboptimal HRR capacity in PBLs as a
predictive biomarker for the mutational signature of HRR in breast tumors. As shown in previous studies, HRR
deficiency in tumors has genetic determinants. However, whether HRR in PBLs is correlated with HRR
phenotype in breast tumor tissue is unknown. Lastly, to dissect the genetic determinants of HRR in PBLs, we
will develop a polygenetic risk score (PRS) for HRR capacity in PBLs and further assess the association of the
PRS with breast cancer risk and tumor mutational signature utilizing existing large-scale genetic and genomic
datasets."

research conducted on a diverse array of organisms alongside translational research seeking to understand the
ways in which rhythms impact human health. This combination of basic and translational research has produced
a body of knowledge that is now poised to transform the way clinicians diagnose, treat, and prevent disease.
This new development, referred to as “Circadian Medicine,” will be a major focus of the SRBR 2024 conference,
whose theme will be “Biological Rhythms from Cell to Clinic.” The conference will bring together scientists from
a wide range of fields, working on a diversity of model systems and at many different levels of biological
organization. The goals of SRBR 2024 are to: facilitate the exchange of the latest research breakthroughs and
new developments in the experimental and analytical methods for chronobiology; expand the network of
chronobiologists beyond the bench and into the clinic by showcasing recent discoveries in Circadian Medicine;
support the professional development for the next generation of chronobiologists; and broaden participation in

poster sessions, which will allow all participants to contribute to the meeting and network. Nastaran Zahir, Ph.D.,
Branch Director from the Center for Cancer Training at NCI, will present a trainee focused presentation on early-
stage grant opportunities and will host one of the round table discussions focused on trainee career development.
Funding through this R13 mechanism is requested for to defray the cost of participating in the meeting for early-
stage investigators and trainees. We expect that researchers studying various aspects of cancer biology and the
microenvironment will cultivate new collaborations and the trainees will identify new mentors as a result of the
networking opportunities from this meeting."
10909020,"This proposal describes our “Integrated Neural Engineering and Rehabilitation Training” program that
produces biomedical engineering Ph.D. graduates who combine state-of-the-art expertise in neural engineering
(an area of bioengineering) with a genuine appreciation of the practice and challenges of clinical rehabilitation.
This T32 is centered in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Case Western Reserve University, but also
includes the strong participation of several of our local medical centers. Our T32 is focused exclusively on
predoctoral training - having trained 59 students since 1999. We are requesting funding for 8 predoctoral
positions per year for five years, and have institutional commitment to match with two additional students. We
expect to train a total of ~20 BME Ph.D. students for two years each over the proposed 5 years. Trainees enter
with undergraduate training in engineering or a closely related discipline. They satisfy the rigorous requirements
of the BME Ph.D. program and benefit from its existing features, while our T32 program adds value through
highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects, a clinical immersion experience, and unique access
to visiting seminar speakers. Over the next 5 years, we will create and pilot a virtual reality-based Neural Anatomy
course (exploiting our unique relationship with the Microsoft HoloLens program), include formal diversity training,
and implement our newly formed external Advisory Committee comprised of academic leaders in rehabilitation
and neural engineering, representatives of large and small companies in the stimulation and rehabilitation
commercial space, practicing neural/rehabilitation physicians, and a student diversity professional.
 The specific objectives of our training program are: (1) Prepare our trainees for productive careers in
rehabilitation and neural engineering; (2) Provide a rigorous engineering education that forms the basis for future
innovation; (3) Provide specific expertise in the development and application of neural stimulation and
interventions for overcoming neurological disorders; (4) Provide specific expertise in modeling and simulation;
(5) Provide an extensive, hands-on clinical immersion experience that prepares each trainee for a translational
career; (6) Provide specific expertise in the deployment and integration of Brain Computer Interfaces; and (7)
Provide real-world professional development training to enhance post-graduation success.
 We have assembled a distinguished group of mentors who serve in one of three roles: Research Training
mentors (17) who are the primary research advisors of the trainees, Associate Research Training Mentors (5)
who are content experts on T32 trainee committees, and Clinical Training Mentors (12) from rehabilitation and
surgical disciplines who insure the clinical relevance of each trainee research project. Trainee project topics
include electrode development; stimulation pattern design; neural motor control mechanisms; neural
biomaterials, protection, and repair; deployment of interventions to individuals with neurological disorders;
neurorehabilitation; modeling and simulation; and brain-computer interfacing."
10929297,"Unloading and paralysis of skeletal muscle after spinal cord injury (SCI) results in severe loss of muscle
contractile function and deleterious alterations in mitochondrial morphology and performance. One potential
mechanism is the de novo appearance of connexin hemichannels (Cx) in paralyzed muscle. We hypothesize
Cx destabilize mitochondrial function in paralyzed muscle. Cx43 and 45 appear in the sarcolemma de novo
after paralysis and are believed to contribute to muscle atrophy by permitting entry of extracellular calcium
(Ca2+) into the muscle fiber. We posit that the systematic study of the role of Cx43 and 45 after SCI using
transgenic mouse models will evaluate the potential of blockers of Cx for future drug development.
 We also propose that protecting mitochondrial function and morphology by a pharmaceutical
intervention may be beneficial for muscle health after SCI. SS-31 is a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant that
has reduced muscle loss and protected mitochondrial function in mouse models of muscle wasting. No study
has tested whether SS-31 improves muscle health after paralysis.
 Our overall objective is to find interventions and treatments to increase the well-being of individuals with
SCI. We hypothesize that muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 will protect muscle health after SCI.
Additional studies will describe the role of drug or diet interventions in protecting muscle function after
paralysis. We believe data from this line of studies will provide insight into multiple novel treatments that
protect muscle health after SCI and provide a path to translatable medicine and future clinical investigations.
1. Specific Aim 1 (Year 1-[3]): Determine whether a muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 protects
mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function in mice paralyzed by SCI
Hypothesis: Muscle-specific knockout of Cx43 and 45 will slow the loss of muscle mass and function and
protect against the degradation of mitochondrial morphology after contusion SCI.
Approach: 4-month old transgenic mice carrying a muscle-specific MyoD-driven Cre-recombinase and floxed
Cx43 and 45 will be given a sham or contusion SCI and be compared to a MyoD-Cre-recombinase-only
genotype control. Behavioral tests, muscles function tests and biochemical outcomes will be analyzed.
2. Specific Aim 2 (Year [4-5]): Investigate the efficacy of an SS-31 drug intervention for preserving
muscle function and mitochondrial morphology and limiting ROS production after SCI.
Hypothesis: Daily injections of SS-31 will protect muscle and mitochondrial morphology after contusion SCI.
Approach: 4-month old wild type C57BL/6 female mice will be given a sham or SCI as well as daily injections of
SS-31 or vehicle across time. Muscle function will be measured ex vivo; ROS production rate will be measured
from isolated muscle mitochondria and whole muscle lysates."

Nuclear receptors are steroid-dependent transcription factors that confer cell identity and function. They guide
development, and maintain homeostasis in adult tissue, such as the testosterone responsive Androgen
Receptor which governs male-specific organs and phenotypes. Aberrant AR-driven gene expression programs
give rise to prostate cancer. When resistance arises after androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) the disease
advances to the much more lethal metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), often becoming
resistant to ADT by overexpressing AR. New evidence suggests that many other transcription factors and
epigenetic co-activator proteins may create disease-specific enhancers with the AR to drive tumors, especially
in treatment-relapsed mCRPC. By harnessing sophisticated molecular biology and computational biology
techniques, we will map the epigenetic mechanisms at work in mCRPC, in clinically relevant PDX models and
cell lines with epigenomes closely matching mCRPC tumors. We will show how to stop the AR-axis using small
molecules (AR in verse agonists, ARIAs) we designed, synthesized and developed with novel mechanisms of
action, where the AR undergoes a chemically induced functional switch, causing the AR to suppress the tumor-
driving genes it normally activates. We will study the way AR creates super clusters in the diseased genome,
and how our new therapy works by altering the co-regulators recruited to AR-super clusters. At the conclusion
of this work, we should have mechanistic understanding the AR under the influence of an inverse agonist,
provide functional 3D epigenetic map of regulatory addictions in advanced PCa, and have explored therapeutic
potential of promising new AR therapeutics."

Fibrin(ogen) plays a critical role in processes such as wound healing, coagulation, cancer, pregnancy, and
inflammation. Fibrin(ogen), which is a blood plasma protein, forms a hierarchical network that gives rise
to its unique mechanical and enzymatic stability. There is a need to understand the interplay between
changes in the biochemical microenvironment that lead to the resulting fibrin network structure and its
mechanical properties. We seek to apply engineering and biophysical techniques to address these
fundamental questions. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to delineate the role that the structure-
function relationship of fibrin(ogen) plays in regulating health and disease. To do this we will characterize
the relationship of fibrin network structure with viscoelastic and rupture mechanics. Then, we will assess
the rupture resistance of fibrin-collagen composites. We will determine how these two materials behave
mechanically both together and at their interface to better understand the regulation of wound healing. We
will study kinetics and the enzymatic dissolution of fibrin networks, where we will probe the influence of
medications on stability. These fundamental studies have important translational and diagnostic
implications going forward."
10940697,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Macromolecular signaling complexes play fundamental roles in biology, ranging from the control of development
to regulation of the immune system. The inflammasome is an example of a macromolecular signaling platform
that activates the innate immune system in response to invading pathogens or endogenous host-derived danger
signals. As the innate immune system regulates inflammation and has crosstalk with the adaptive immune
system, dysregulation of inflammasome signaling is associated with autoinflammatory and autoimmune
disorders. Activation of the inflammasome involves the recognition of intracellular danger signals by germline-
encoded pattern recognition receptors that then recruit an adaptor protein known as ASC (although in some
instances ASC is dispensable) to form the inflammasome. ASC then recruits a cysteine protease known as
caspase-1 to the inflammasome where it undergoes autoproteolytic maturation. Active caspase-1 then cleaves
substrates that are important for restoring cellular homeostasis, including the interleukin family of cytokines, IL-
1 and IL-18, and the pore forming protein GSDMD to induce a lytic type of cell death known as pyroptosis. The
mechanism of how inflammasomes are assembled, in particular, how the different proteins are organized in
space and time to ensure proper function, is not well understood. Of note, the incorporation of ASC on the
inflammasome is required for cytokine processing, but the mechanism of how ASC induces cytokine activation
has remained unclear for over a decade. Additionally, some inflammasomes are ASC-independent but can form
ASC-containing inflammasomes. How these inflammasomes decide when to form an ASC-independent or ASC
containing inflammasome is a mystery. The goal of this proposal is to address these fundamental questions in
innate immunity. We will elucidate the mechanism of cytokine activation and delineate the spatiotemporal
regulation of inflammasomes. To accomplish this, we have developed new tools that will allow us to build a
spatiotemporal map of inflammasome formation and signaling, which will provide key mechanistic insights to aid
therapeutic development for immune related disorders. Furthermore, we anticipate these tools will become
important biomedical research tools."

 Our current project, “A Layered Examination of the Patient Experience to Elucidate the Role of Palliative
Care in Surgical Care for Seriously Ill Adults” (R01 AG070252-01A1) has contributed insights into the role of
palliative care for seriously ill older adults undergoing elective surgeries. However, quantitative data from this
project reveals that more than half of major surgical procedures for seriously ill older adults are unplanned (i.e.,
urgent, emergent), rather than elective, and that hip fracture is one of the most common surgical conditions
among this group. Furthermore, our prior work shows that most older adults with hip fracture have palliative
care needs preceding injury. These findings highlight a key area of research, particularly for persons living with
dementia (PLWD), as over 60% of surgery among PLWD is unplanned, and the risk of hip fracture in PLWD is
2.7 times greater than those without dementia. Specifically, we have identified critical knowledge gaps at the
intersection of surgery and palliative care that would benefit from supplemental funding: 1) The frequency with
which seriously ill older adults and PLWD receive palliative care and its association with long-term outcomes in
the setting of unplanned surgical care is unexamined. 2) Contextual factors influencing palliative care delivery
during inpatient care for hip fracture and, particularly for PLWD, are undescribed. 3) There is insufficient
evidence about deliberations for surgery and outcomes among adults who do not have surgery to guide
improvements in the caregiver experience or shared decision making.
 Building upon the methodologies, resources, and procedures utilized in our current project, this
supplemental work examines the role of palliative care in unplanned surgical care for hip fracture among
seriously ill older adults, with a specific focus on PLWD. Aim 1 will identify a retrospective cohort of older
seriously ill adults (≥66) with hip fractures in a large regional health system and use natural language
processing in electronic health data linked to Medicare Claims to identify inpatient palliative care processes
(goals of care discussions, healthcare proxy documentation, caregiver assessments, specialty palliative care,
hospice referrals). We will evaluate associations between inpatient palliative care and healthcare utilization
within one-year post-discharge, and sub-analyses to assess this relationship among PLWD. Aim 2 uses
ethnographic observations to obtain an in-depth understanding of contextual factors influencing palliative care
delivery for older adults with serious illness and PWLD with hip fractures. Observations will focus on decisions
for surgery, caregiver involvement, and transitions to post-acute care. Responding to the National Institutes of
Health’s call for research related to experiences of PLWD, geriatric palliative care, and emergency care for
older adults, findings from the proposed studies will guide surgical and palliative care for the growing numbers
of older adults with serious illness and dementia with hip fracture and other acute surgical conditions and
inform the design and conduct of future studies of palliative and emergency care for seriously ill older patients."

 IRACDA at the University of Kansas: The goals of the KU-IRACDA program are to give postdoctoral
scholars comprehensive, mentored training in research at KU, together with effective pedagogical preparation
and meaningful instructional experiences at one of our partner teaching institutions, Haskell Indian Nations
University and Kansas City Kansas Community College (KCKCC). Our ultimate goal is to place well-trained
postdoctoral scholars in fulfilling academic jobs, whether centered primarily on research or on teaching.
 KU has dozens of faculty active in research areas relevant to the NIGMS mission. These individuals are
dedicated to training the next generation of academic scientists, and have the research infrastructure, the
financial support, and the time to mentor KU-IRACDA scholars to success. Our program will recruit 4 scholars
in our first year, and progressively build to a steady-state cohort of 10 scholars. Notably, one of these positions
will be supported through the life of the proposed award by the KU Cancer Center.
 KU has a number of ongoing training grants focused on enhancing diversity within the biomedical
research enterprise. Our KU-IRACDA recruitment strategy will leverage these established programs, and
target populations that are traditionally underrepresented in the biomedical sciences. Our application process
will select successful early-career researchers who have a strong intellectual connection with a KU mentor, a
demonstrated commitment to increasing STEM diversity, a desire to learn inclusive instructional methods, and
the goal of obtaining a faculty position. During their 3 years in the KU-IRACDA program, scholars will advance
their careers via three interrelated sets of activities. First, scholars will receive mentoring from an accomplished
KU faculty member and a small mentoring committee, and push forward cutting-edge biomedical research,
resulting in the presentations and publications required to transition to a faculty position in academia. Second,
under the guidance of the program MPIs and an internal Advisory Committee, scholars will work with groups
on the KU campus (e.g., the Center for Teaching Excellence and the Office for Diversity in Science Training),
as well as their mentors at our partner teaching-focused institutions, to gain experience with modern
pedagogical tools, and build skills in culturally-sensitive teaching methods. Subsequently, scholars will get
direct experience working with students in the classroom, teaching courses at either Haskell or KCKCC, both
of which serve communities that are underrepresented in STEM. Especially for scholars focused on a
teaching-intensive academic position, such experiences will be invaluable preparation for their future careers.
Third, via one-to-one mentor-scholar coaching, and through established courses, programs, and workshops,
scholars will have access to a series of professional development opportunities. By deploying Individual
Development Plans, and ensuring mentors are involved in their generation and ongoing refinement, we will
help promote the career goals of our scholars via a tailored system of training activities."

Metabolic pathways are crucial for cellular energy and function. Dysregulated metabolism is a distinctive feature of
various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative diseases.
Given its integral role in disease pathology, accurately and comprehensively characterizing metabolic alterations offers
immense potential for enhancing our understanding of disease biology, improving clinical diagnostics, prevention, and
management. Specifically, such characterizations can lead to: (1) a deeper understanding of metabolic variation and
heterogeneity in disease tissue microenvironments; (2) the identification of novel drug targets or metabolic biomarkers
for early diagnosis and treatment optimization; and (3) the development of tailored nutritional and dietary
recommendations to enhance patient health quality. While significant progress has been made in studying metabolic
activities across species, a pivotal gap exists. On one hand, current analyses often fail to delineate the variations and
heterogeneities of metabolic activities in highly altered disease microenvironment. Existing methodologies tend to
present an averaged view of heterogeneous cell populations within tissues, overlooking the intricate metabolic
heterogeneity and exchanges that occur in complex tissues. This is especially concerning given that cells are known
to adapt their metabolism in response to various biochemical conditions. On the other hand, compared to other areas
like transcriptional regulation or immune response, there exists a marked gap in leveraging omics data to characterize
metabolic variations, necessitating tailored systems biology models and tools. In this MIRA project, we aim to address
these essential gaps by overcoming four challenges. First, we seek a systematic and data-driven approach to
characterize metabolic landscapes in disease systems, recognizing that metabolic pathways are multifaceted and
variations could span from flux to network topology. Second, we intend to harness the power of multi-omics data and
extant knowledge to bridge gaps in metabolic modeling, aiming for a thorough elucidation of the metabolic fluxome
and thereby achieving a holistic characterization of metabolic activities. Third, we aim to mechanistically decode the
functional roles of metabolic variations in diseases, emphasizing the heterogeneity and adaptability of metabolic
phenotypes. Finally, by applying our systematic research framework into our -omics testbeds covering several disease
types, we aim to pinpoint metabolic abnormalities, that could aid in precision medical interventions, and diet and
nutrient recommendations. Overall, our project promises to develop a suite of unparalleled computational tools: a
data-driven research framework built upon a novel biophysics-informed neural network, dynamic models for in-depth
metabolic analysis, cutting-edge statistical metrics, and a natural language processing tool to mine disease-specific
metabolic insights from literature. This is complemented by tools for specific analytical tasks, a curated omics testbed,
and a publicly accessible knowledge base. Together, these innovations promise to revolutionize our understanding of
disease metabolism, with validations planned on selected systems."

A healthy human microbiome is intrinsically linked to vital physiological aspects such as development, immune
function, and nutrition. The composition and function of the human microbiota is significantly influenced by
access to key metal micronutrients including iron, copper, zinc, and cobalt. Although mechanisms of competition
for metals have been studied in metal-limited environmental systems, how the human microbiota acquires metals
and responds to changes in host metal homeostasis remains under investigated, even as microorganisms must
compete with one another for limited resources at metal-limited body sites. Production of metallophores, small-
molecule natural products that bind metals with high affinity and selectivity, can enable colonization of metal-
limited environments; for example, we recently showed that Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 persists in the zinc-
limited inflamed gut by producing zinc-binding yersiniabactin. Metallophore-production can also benefit other,
non-producer organisms in microbial systems, as metallophores can be shared goods in complex microbial
communities. Recent examples have revealed that Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a human commensal
bacterium, uses siderophores produced by other bacteria for iron acquisition during iron-limitation. However,
despite significant numbers of metallophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) present in metagenomics
sequencing data from human-derived microbiota samples, elucidation of the chemical structures and properties
of these microbial molecules remain limited by various analytical, chemical, and biological challenges. This lack
of reliable methods precludes our understanding of functional roles of these molecules. Therefore, the goal of
this proposal is to elucidate the structure and functions of microbially-derived metallophores as modulating
microbe-microbe and community interactions within human microbiomes. To accomplish this, our laboratory will
investigate several critical questions, broadly these are: 1) what metallophores are produced by the human
microbiota and how are they biosynthesized? 2) what are their metal preferences and specificities? 3) how do
these molecules modulate microbial interactions? 4) what are the effects of altered microbial interactions? With
these questions in mind, we develop discovery-based approaches to find uncharacterized microbial
metallophores, pursue chemical structure elucidation and characterization of biosynthesis, and investigate
growth and metal acquisition of wild-type and genetic deletion mutants (lacking metallophore-production ability)
to understand functional roles of these molecules in monoculture, co-culture, and in complex microbial model
systems. Elucidating the metal-uptake molecules and mechanisms used by the microbiota to withstand altered
metal homeostasis may allow for the development of microbiome-based therapeutics, identification of
microbiome-derived biomarkers, and an improved understanding of metal imbalances. This research will provide
fundamental insight how members of the microbiota interact through metal competition, a key mechanism by
which both opportunistic infections and probiotic organisms are established and persist within the microbiome."

The objective of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate an online contraception decision aid,
ContraceptionForAll, for transgender or gender-nonconforming (TGNC) persons assigned female at birth
(AFAB). The specific aims are: (1) build the ContraceptionForAll tool by engaging the TGNC AFAB individuals
in participatory design to enhance the platform, system function, and usability of an existing prototype
developed by our group; (2) assess the usefulness and usability of ContraceptionForAll in a series of mixed-
methods studies with cognitive walkthrough, usability testing, simulated test cases, a user survey, and follow-
up interviews; and (3) conduct a randomized controlled trial to use ContraceptionForAll as a digital intervention
to improve contraceptive decision-making, sexual health knowledge, and mental health for TGNC AFAB
people. The proposed research fills the current knowledge gap in characterizing the structure and process of
contraceptive decision-making among the TGNC AFAB individuals. It directly addresses the unmet health
needs of the TGNC AFAB population and advocates for health and healthcare equity for this gender-minority
group. It has the potential to advance culturally appropriate healthcare as well as to fight against potential
biases, stigma, and discriminations. From the technology perspective, it will develop guiding principles for
engaging gender-minority groups in participatory design of digital health tools as part of the efforts to build
cultural competence for the biomedical informatics and health IT workforce. It builds on: (1) our team’s
expertise and experiences in health information dissemination research, clinical decision support systems and
patient decision aids, design and evaluation of information systems, gender-minority health, reproductive
health, behavioral and mental health, clinical trials, and biostatistics; and (2) our preliminary work in
development and evaluation of online contraceptive decision aids for both cisgender women and TGNC AFAB
individuals. The digital intervention developed from this project will directly serve the TGNC AFAB population
and has the potentials to enhance their sexual health education, to facilitate contraception decision-making,
and to improve their sexual and mental health. The proposed research is highly responsive to AHRQ’s
priorities in: (1) study of decision making tailored to the needs of disadvantaged populations; and (2) advancing
health and healthcare equity. The success of the proposed research will lay out a foundation for dissemination
of the digital intervention to the TGNC AFAB population in the next stage."
10940999,"Drug development is time consuming and costly with little certainty of eventually leading to an approved
medicine. As new therapies are urgently needed, research is required to scrutinize the status quo to reduce the
guesswork for a more efficient process. The overall goal of our program is to evaluate aspects of drug
development and offer new methods that expose flaws and opportunities for the accelerated delivery of new
therapies. Our projects utilize protein kinases as platforms to inform best practices relevant to virtually all drug
development campaigns. Each of our program areas are made capable of filling interrelated gaps in knowledge
because of innovative applications of our novel ATP-allosteric bivalent inhibitors (AABIs) that were originally
designed to target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The first program area is directed to selectively
target the inactive state broadly in human kinases. Our AABIs are only able to bind the inactive state enabling
the rapid discernment of promising new targets. We will tailor AABIs in cutting-edge target engagement assays
as proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders to enable innovative discovery approaches of kinases in
their native cellular contexts, which will serve as inspiration for other streamlined discovery approaches in drug
discovery. The second program area seeks to use EGFR as a model system for elucidating the molecular and
structural factors that influence the activity of linked compounds. Recent progress highlights our ability to develop
structural and functional understandings of linker design relevant to fragment-based drug design in addition to
fine tuning of properties of PROTAC degraders. Our third program area sets out to acquire deeper appreciation
of what causes variabilities in covalent inhibitor activity assays that potentially confuse drug optimization. We
have discovered that covalent EGFR inhibitors exhibit large potency differences based on their chemical
properties as a result of minor changes in how activity assays are performed. Our structurally diverse covalent
EGFR AABIs allow for a maximally comprehensive analysis of these effects as they can be made with a variety
of chemical structures. The work in this program will successfully fill gaps in our knowledge related to drug
development and pave the way for the accelerated production of new therapies. Our projects are interconnected
by their ability to improve drug development enabled by innovative applications of our novel AABI kinase
inhibitors. Additionally, these efforts are designed to logically evolve in future directions for upcoming MIRA
periods relevant to developing novel kinase inhibitors and applications across diverse pharmacological
approaches including covalent inhibitors, PROTAC degraders, fragment-based drug design, and others. The PI
is the main driver of this research program with multi-disciplinary expertise and a long-term vision to leverage
the molecular and structural insights discovered in these projects to shape decision making in drug discovery,
design, and development."
10925589,"To ensure aging Veterans remain active and mobile with as little musculoskeletal pain as possible, new
approaches to the prevention of osteoporosis and promotion of timely bone regeneration following a fracture are
necessary. This collaborative research study brings together a group of VA investigators with diverse
perspectives, insights, models, and techniques, to synergistically attack a major clinical problem that leads to
high morbidity and mortality among Veterans, a bone fracture. The overall research strategy of each integrated
project is to use pre-clinical models of a disease that either weakens bone or delays bone repair, to investigate
novel ways to enhance the ability of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to promote bone formation, and to assess
disease and treatment effects on bone in a unified, stringent manner. Already under-diagnosed and under-
treated, osteoporosis is likely to increase the number of fragility fractures being treated at VA hospitals without
novel tools for early detection and novel treatment strategies that circumvent the rare but devastating side effects
of current therapies that inhibit bone loss. Addressing this unmet clinical need, the overall aims are to identify
therapeutic strategies to improve bone health among Veterans and to enhance the bone anabolism of PTH
signaling. The collaboration will address this overarching hypothesis: health problems disproportionately
affecting Veterans activate signaling pathways that increase bone resorption, suppress bone formation, or
impede the transition of cartilage to bone in a fracture callus such that improvements in the clinical management
of osteoporosis lie in understanding how these health problems hurt bone health.
This project entitled “PTH receptor Signaling and Diabetes-Induced Bone Disease” will test the hypothesis that
that diabetes (DM) triggers Nox-mediated ROS distress and cholesterol accumulation in bone, which impact
bone formation and material properties; and that these effects are reversed by activation of the PTH Receptor
(PTH1R)/SIK axis in osteocytes. This hypothesis will be tested using a preclinical model of established DM,
bones from diabetic patients, FDA-approved PTH1R ligands PTH and ABL, the orally available SK-124 inhibitor,
and molecular, cellular, and tissue level advanced approaches. Aim 1 will establish the contribution of Nox/ROS
distress and cellular cholesterol accumulation to DM bone disease. We will determine whether DM-induced bone
disease is prevented 1a) by interfering with p22phox-Nox-mediated ROS in mice with loss of function of the
CYBA gene/p22phox protein and/or 1b) by increasing ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux pharmacologically with
the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist GW3965. Aim 2 will identify the target cell(s) in bone mediating the crosstalk
between DM and PTH1R/SIK axis. We will establish cell population profiles, gene expression, and
function/pathway enrichment analysis in bone and bone marrow cells, separately, by single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq). Results will be validated by quantification of targeted gene ex-pression (NanoString) and tissue-
spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx). We will use bones from DM mice treated with PTH, ABL, or SK-124; and from
diabetic patients and control individuals subjected to hip replacement. Aim 3 will determine the role of osteocytes
in the restoration of bone material properties by the PTH1R/SIK axis in DM. We will investigate if osteocytes are
needed in vivo for PTH/ABL/SK-124 to correct the deteriorated bone matrix properties induced by DM, including
changes in bound water, Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) composition, and Advance Glycosylation End Products
(AGEs), using osteocytic PTH1R knockout mice. Aims 1-3 and Aim 2 will be supported by the Bone Quality Core
and the Molecular Biology and Histology Core of the FRACTURE CURVE, respectively. Successful completion
of the proposed studies will reveal novel genes, pathways, and cells to be therapeutically targeted downstream
of the PTH1R signaling pathway to restore skeletal health in the frame of DM."

The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and
graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the
Center for Neural Science (CNS) and the Cognition and Perception (C&P) program in the Department of
Psychology, reflecting the dual roles of brain and behavior. The TPCN program faculty consist of 24 highly
productive PIs. The TPCN will be a continuation of the NIH-funded program run successfully at NYU from 2016
to 2021, which trained 24 undergraduate and 12 predoctoral students and built an infrastructure of community
activities. The TPCN fits well with NYU’s strengths: a) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of
computational neuroscientists, and NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since
1994 b) In the past year alone, the two participating departments have hired four primarily
computational/theoretical faculty; c) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as
1992; d) program faculty have a strong track record of wide-ranging collaborations as well as of co-mentoring
predoctoral students.
Each trainee in the TPCN will complete a year of coursework, laboratory research, and TPCN-specific
professional development activities, which include skill tutorials, orientation on the next career stage,
workshopping each other’s writings and presentations, faculty openly discussing the backstories of their
careers (“Growing up in Science”), predoctoral trainees mentoring undergraduate trainees, and didactic journal
clubs preceding computational neuroscience seminars by external speakers. Together, these activities form a
comprehensive preparation for an academic career in computational neuroscience.
A major goal of the TPCN will be to increase access to and diversity in computational neuroscience
especially at the undergraduate level. This requires making hidden curriculum explicit and compensating for
students’ pre-college differences in opportunity. We will realize this through a variety of measures, including a)
holding a math boot camp preceding application to TPCN; b) providing earlier exposure to research; c)
introducing undergraduate lab rotations; d) reducing the default duration of a traineeship from 2 to 1 years,
thus offering broader access."

Rationale: To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.
Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and modeling the
data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are desperately needed.
This project supports interdisciplinary graduate training programs in computational neuroscience (TPCN) at
both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in
computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are available to students coming from colleges and
universities throughout the United States.
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) is a world leader and innovator in quantitative fields such as
machine learning, computer science, and artificial intelligence, and recently, neuroscience has emerged as a
field for strategic growth at the university. The University of Pittsburgh is renowned for the strength of its clinical
and biomedical research programs. The TPCN is set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary environment of
our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by CMU and Pitt. The CNBC
was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural mechanisms of brain function, and
now comprises 162 faculty having appointments in 32 departments.
Goals: The goals of the TPCN are to:
1) Support computational training of PhD students across the neurosciences,
2) Broaden accessibility for students historically underrepresented in STEM by augmenting an existing
MS-to-PhD training program that prepares them for advanced graduate training in computational
neuroscience,
3) Expand computational training of undergraduate students through a formal academic minor in
computational neuroscience,
4) Support an undergraduate summer program that combines a two-week “boot-camp” overview of
computational neuroscience with an 8-week research experience,
5) Create online materials that not only serve our own students but are publicly available on the web, and

processes interacting to determine whether a pathogen successfully infects a host, transmission 
parameters often assume a constant per-contact transmission probability. Factors that can influence risk of 
infection include the frequency of exposures, duration of a contact, and dose acquired during an 
interaction, which are collectively referred to as transmission determinants. These determinants of infection 
can vary among hosts and between routes of transmission (e.g. direct and indirect) and have profound 
effects on disease dynamics. Ultimately, a mechanistic understanding of how heterogeneity in transmission 
probabilities among exposure events contributes to disease dynamics remains an important outstanding 
question in the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Here we seek to elucidate how factors 
determining transmission success influence the probability of acquiring infection, epidemic 
dynamics, and pathogen evolution.
Specifically, we will investigate how transmission determinants (pathogen dose, contact duration, and 
contact frequency) vary among exposure routes (direct and indirect) and ultimately contribute to the 
dynamics of an emerging multi-host disease of snakes. Snake fungal disease (SFD) is caused by, 
Ophidiomyces ophidiicola, which is an environmentally persistent fungal pathogen that, to date, has been 
documented in more than 42 species of wild snakes on three continents, and has contributed to the severe 
declines of several species. O. ophidiicola is transmitted through direct and indirect contacts, and the 
behavior of snake species affected by SFD naturally vary along an exposure duration and contact intensity 
gradient, making this an ideal system for understanding the effects of variation in exposure events on 
disease dynamics. This work will highlight important mechanisms that contribute to variation in snake 
declines, and more broadly, provide insight into the theoretical underpinnings and profound effects that 
factors determining successful transmission can have on infectious disease outbreaks.
This proposal will leverage our recent advances in this multi-host system and use a combination of 
field, experimental, and modeling approaches to provide critical insight into how the dynamics of exposure 
events have cascading effects on infectious disease."

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) syndromes span the spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders
affecting movement and cognitive function and are pathologically related to Alzheimer's disease. In this project,
we will develop a robust multi-modal platform for remote monitoring of motor symptoms, speech and cognitive
function in FTLD syndromes using wearable sensors and digitized tests. We will validate this solution in
Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) by collecting longitudinal data from 60 PSP patients over a period of 12
months. PSP is a severe and rapidly progressive FTLD syndrome that lacks effective treatment and leads to
rapid onset of dementia, disability and death. The rapid progression of PSP will allow us to validate the solution
within the timeline of this Direct Phase II SBIR project and facilitate future studies in FTLD syndromes.
In this Direct Phase II project, we will recruit 60 participants with PSP from 2 leading CurePSP Centers of Care.
These participants will be monitored for 12 months. The sensor data will be collected using PAMSys, a wearable
sensor developed by the support from a NIH STTR grant award. PAMSys is patented (U.S. Patents # 8,206,325,
9,005,141, and 9,901,209), validated and commercialized by BioSensics. The digitized tests will be collected
using BioDigit Home, a unified solution for the collection of digital biomarkers that is currently being used in
several NIH-funded studies and pharma-sponsored clinical trials in neurological disorders. BioSensics has
already customized its BioDigit Home solution to monitor motor, speech and cognitive functions in PSP, and has
carried out a pilot study with 7 PSP patients, who were monitored for up to 3 months using the developed system.
We will collect data from 60 PSP patients in this aim to develop a set of algorithms for monitoring motor, speech
and cognitive function that will enable objective assessment of PSP disease severity and progression, thereby
creating a multi-modal remote monitoring solution for PSP. These tools will accelerate clinical trials that are
focused on the development of novel therapeutics for tauopathies (i.e., FTD, PSP CBS) and can be readily
adapted to many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, myotonic dystrophy and stroke.
BioSensics is a 2020 Tibbetts Award winner with a proven track record of rapidly transitioning applied
governmental research funding into real commercial results. The initial market for our technology is
pharmaceutical clinical trials, where BioSensics is a vendor of record of medical-grade wearable sensors and
digital clinical trial technologies for multiple pharmaceutical companies. The current project will significantly
broaden BioSensics' offerings to pharmaceutical companies, specifically by providing a solution for digital
assessments of speech, motor and cognition function, which are relevant to many diseases. This commercial
potential is fully aligned with the latest recommendations from the FDA, NSF and NIH to digitize clinical trials."

Approximately 1 in 3 children in the US experience neglect and/or abuse (“maltreatment”) before they turn 18
years old, with marginalized racial and ethnic communities and young children facing the greatest risks. For the
past century, research has treated maltreatment largely as a failing of individual parents, despite robust
evidence that maltreatment risk, particularly for neglect and physical abuse, is powerfully shaped by structural
determinants such as poverty and stress. Population-level maltreatment prevention could have major public
health impacts, but it is not yet clear how to prevent maltreatment at scale. Emerging research suggests that
economic and social welfare policies that alleviate financial hardship and reduce stressors for families could
potentially serve as population-level prevention interventions. However, two major gaps limit the utility of the
existing evidence base for identifying policies with the potential to prevent maltreatment. First, prior research
has evaluated individual policies one at a time without accounting for the ways that changes in one safety net
policy may affect the eligibility for and benefits from others. This failure to account for policy interactions may
result in mis-estimation of overall safety net benefits and mis-attribution of effects of one policy to another.
Second, prior research has almost exclusively assessed maltreatment through Child Protective Services (CPS)
involvement (e.g., reports of maltreatment to CPS), and thus impacts on other critical public health outcomes
such as maltreatment-related injuries remain unknown. The overarching goal of this research is to identify the
impact of social safety net policies on CPS reports and injuries related to neglect and physical abuse in young
children. Two key innovations will directly address current knowledge gaps. First, to estimate benefits from
each major social safety net program (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, and Medicaid/CHIP), accounting for
other programs, we will use and expand a safety net benefits calculator. This calculator sequentially applies
program rules for each state and year, allowing benefits from one program (e.g., TANF) to be incorporated into
eligibility and benefits estimates for others (e.g., SNAP), as dictated by program rules. Second, we will
combine and harmonize over 300 state-years of data on ED and inpatient visits for pediatric injuries that are
highly correlated with maltreatment. We will estimate the impact of social safety net policies on these
maltreatment-related injuries in addition to CPS reports. We will focus on young children (aged <5 years) as
they are at greatest risk of maltreatment. We will also examine these outcomes by race and ethnicity to
determine impacts on equity. The aims of our research are to: (1) Estimate the effect of major social safety net
policies (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, Medicaid/CHIP) on CPS reports of neglect and physical abuse in
young children (age <5 years), overall and by race and ethnicity; and (2) Estimate the effect of major social
safety net policies (EITC, CTC, SSI, TANF, SNAP/WIC, Medicaid/CHIP) on neglect- and physical abuse-
related hospitalizations in young children (age <5 years), overall and by race and ethnicity."

Chronic health conditions—diseases that require ongoing medical attention—affect 1 in 5 people of
reproductive age in the United States.1 Although these conditions are common, little is known about the
interplay of chronic disease and fertility, defined as childbearing goals, timing, and achievement. It is likely that
chronic health conditions have implications for fertility,4–7 as chronic diseases may affect the ability to healthily
carry a pregnancy to term, to survive childbirth, and to parent with health restrictions and lifespan limitations.8–
10 Prior research has found that women with poor self-reported health and disabilities have lower fertility goals;
4–7 however, it is unclear how chronic health conditions that have implications for gestational health and
increase the risk of premature disability and mortality affect fertility goals, timing, and achievement. Due to the
likelihood that different diseases affect fertility in distinct ways, the proposed research examines the fertility
implications of three serious health conditions: unipolar depression, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes.
This project uses mixed methods data, including two nationally representative datasets, 1) the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and 2) the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, as
well as semi-structured interview data collected by the investigator. This project addresses three aims. In Aim
1, the impact of three chronic health conditions on women’s fertility will be estimated. Using longitudinal data, I
will estimate the fertility goals, timing, and achievement of women with and without any of the three health
conditions. Sequence analysis and ordinary-least squares regression will be used to estimate the impact of
chronic health conditions on these fertility processes. As fertility patterns may differ across health conditions, I
will also investigate women’s fertility patterns across the three different chronic diseases. Finally, I will test for
differences by race. In Aim 2, qualitative data collected by the investigator will be used to describe how women
with the three chronic health conditions make decisions about fertility. Interviews will explore the importance of
timing of chronic disease diagnosis, how chronic disease affects decisions about when, whether, and how to
get pregnant, and mechanisms through which chronic conditions impact fertility. Data from the quantitative and
qualitative phases will be combined using an explanatory integrative approach. In Aim 3, the investigator
proposes a tailored training plan to develop the necessary knowledge, methodological skills, and professional
competencies to implement the proposed research. This includes training in longitudinal and hierarchical data
analysis, as well as integrative mixed methods data analysis. A strong team of senior scientists, with expertise
in social demography, fertility, longitudinal data analysis, mixed methods, obstetrics and gynecology, and
clinical management of patients with complex pregnancies will mentor the applicant. This study will enable
understanding of the impacts of simultaneously managing fertility and chronic health conditions, which has
important implications for clinicians, demographers, reproductive justice advocates, and policy makers."

The University of Washington (UW) has a long-standing history of commitment to research in the
areas of normal and disordered hearing, balance, speech, language and communication. In addition,
it has an outstanding interdisciplinary community of investigators in all of the subdisciplines of basic
neuroscience. At the intersection of these communities lies a diverse and highly productive group of
investigators who study the fundamental neural mechanisms that underlie hearing and
communication. One important mission of the auditory neuroscience community at UW is to mentor
the trainees who will carry on this line of research and advance our knowledge of the field in the
future. The Auditory Neuroscience Training Program, established in 2002, helps train the basic
neuroscience researchers whose work will form the foundation for research in the clinical disciplines.
It therefore complements the existing UW clinical training program in Otolaryngology. The training
experience at UW currently includes five predoctoral training slots since this is the area in which
strong support during the early stages of training is most crucial, and three postdoctoral training
positions for those transitioning to auditory neuroscience from other disciplines. Trainees participate
in active research programs in neuroanatomy, development, genetics, cell and molecular biology,
neuropharmacology, and electrophysiology of the peripheral and central auditory system as well as
psychoacoustics, language perception and processing, and communication behavior. They also have
the opportunity to combine research in more than one area through collaborative efforts. Through
courses, journal clubs, retreats and broader professional development activities, program trainees are
exposed to a wide range of research techniques, enabling them to conduct conceptually and
technologically sophisticated research programs. Importantly, continued support through the training
program should greatly enhance the ability of the UW to attract and retain high-caliber trainees from
underrepresented groups and prepare them for future research careers in auditory neuroscience."

The purpose of the NIDA Animal Genetics Program is to identify genetic, genomic, epigenetic variants,
physiology and brain functions that contribute to addiction-like behaviors, related behavioral endophenotypes,
and behavioral comorbidities to substance use disorder. During the past four years, our multidisciplinary and
highly collaborative consortium has been identifying gene variants that are associated with increased
vulnerability to compulsive-like cocaine use by performing the first GWAS using an advanced model of chronic
intravenous cocaine self-administration in N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS). We have also created the first
preclinical cocaine biobank which enables researchers who do not have the resources to perform chronic
intravenous self-administration or next-generation genome sequencing to perform advanced genetic,
molecular, and cellular studies to further our understanding of the biological changes underlying addiction-like
behaviors. While these efforts have been very successful in achieving the planned milestones, it has become
clear that our project would benefit from an even larger sample size. In particular, increasing sample sizes lead
to exponential rather than linear increase in the number of loci identified. Moreover, in the past four years there
has been tremendous technological advances in behavioral and genetic analysis that can be leveraged to
provide unprecedented access to identify the single nucleotide and structural variants that contribute to
complex behavioral endophenotypes of high relevance to cocaine use-disorders. The first goal of this
competing renewal is to double the sample size of the current GWAS to increase the number of gene variants
identified and meet the demands of the Biobank. The second goal is to use high-throughput behavioral
phenotyping using markerless pose estimation based on transfer learning with deep neural network to identify
behavioral endophenotypes that can help predict and identify individuals with a resistant, mild, moderate, or
severe phenotype of cocaine addiction-like behaviors. The third goal is to use methodological improvements of
the genetic analysis, including the analysis of structural variants and tandem repeats, as well as enhanced
integration with gene expression data. The fourth goal is to strengthen the cocaine biobank infrastructure. This
project is likely to continue having a sustained and powerful impact on the field because it will provide an
exponential increase in the number of genetic loci identified, eQTLs and PheWAS analysis related to addiction-
like behavior; establish the first high-throughput behavioral motifs analysis of addiction-like behaviors using
parallel video-recording and automated machine learning analysis; identify novel behavioral endophenotypes
of vulnerability/resistance to addiction-like behaviors; and expand and improve the Cocaine Biobank offering
and infrastructure."

 Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is the most common cause of hearing loss, is heritable, and is one
of the most prevalent conditions affecting the elderly globally. Twin and family studies reveal 25-75%
heritability for ARHI (Momi et al., 2015). Estimates suggest approximately two‐thirds of people over the age of
70 in the United States experience ARHI, and that by 2020, over half of all people in the United States with
hearing loss will be over 70 years of age (Bainbridge and Wallhagen, 2014). ARHI has been shown to be
independently associated with cognitive decline, dementia, depression, and loneliness and results in an
estimated annual economic burden of over $3 billion (Deal et al., 2017; Deal et al., 2018; Lin and Albert, 2014).
Our overarching hypothesis, supported by preliminary data in both mice and humans, is that ARHI is a
complex trait with many likely genes associated (Fransen et al., 2015; Friedman et al., 2009; Kalra et al., 2019;
Wells et al., 2019). Greater than 100 genes have been identified for monogenic deafness; however, a
substantial fraction of patients with ARHI have no identifiable mutation in any known deafness gene suggesting
that there remain additional genes to discover (Bowl and Dawson, 2018).
 Mice continue to be the predominant organism for hearing research. Similarities in the auditory structure
and physiology between mice and humans, the close evolutionary relationship of genomes (most genes in
mice have a human homologue), relatively low housing costs, genetic standardization and the available
genetic toolkit make the mouse a crucial model system for the study of the functional genomics of the auditory
system (Bowl and Dawson, 2015). We are proposing to identify candidate genes by performing the first
complete genome-wide association study (GWAS) of ARHI in CFW mice and examining gene expression in
the inner ear. Although several labs including ours have used human subjects for GWAS, to date there exist no
comprehensively characterized cohorts with sufficient power and therefore there exist limited replication
studies of candidate genes. In Aim 1, we will measure auditory brainstem response and distortion product
otoacoustic emission thresholds in 2,000 one-year-old CFW mice equally divided among males and females.
We will genotype each mouse at more than 1,000,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers and in Aim 2
perform GWAS to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). In Aim 3, we will use RNAseq to assess differences in
gene expression in the inner ears of 100 randomly selected mice from the CFW cohort and define expressed
QTLs (eQTLs).The genetic variation within CFW mice presents a unique opportunity to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms that underlie ARHI providing novel targets for drug development and providing a means for
identifying patients at risk."
10906861,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: A number of candidate therapies such as CRISPR-Cas9 and gene
silencing require the efficient delivery of functional nucleic acids to the cell cytosol and nucleus. Unfortunately,
such therapies currently lack proper delivery mechanisms, precluding their widespread applicability. Self-
assembled deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nanoparticles have shown potential as minimally cytotoxic
therapeutic carriers in cancerous and other in vitro and in vivo models. While evidence suggests that DNA
nanoparticles-based drug carriers can be taken up by mammalian cells via endocytosis, it is unknown
how these DNA nanoparticles can overcome the fate of endocytosis-triggered degradation to reach
the cytosol and, once there, can controllably maintain stability. With the enabling science explaining
their behavior and mechanisms of controlling their stability in the cell cytosol it will be possible to make bold
advances in engineering therapeutic delivery systems. To that end, the proposed work has two overarching
scientific payoffs. Payoff 1, induce endosomal escape and enhanced cytosolic accessibility of DNA
nanoparticles by the integration of calcium in their assembly process. Payoff 2, identify the rate of
breakdown and mechanisms of stabilization of DNA nanoparticles in different types of cell cytosols.
Innovative technologies will be the foci of the PI's training program and will be implemented to achieve the
project goals, namely, multi-step Förster resonance energy transfer spectroscopy for high-resolution
tracking of DNA nanoparticle inside the cell and in vitro cell microinjections enabling study of these
nanoparticles directly in the cytosolic environment. First, a DNA origami based nanotube will be tested for
structural stability in calcium-supplemented buffer. Thereafter, the nanotube will be used as a carrier for
the delivery of functional RNA molecules to representative fluorescent protein-expressing cells and checked
for its cytosolic reachability and efficacy in protein regulation after undergoing endocytosis. Second, small
(20 nm) DNA nanoparticles with branched architecture and non-canonical nucleic acids will be embedded
with multi-step FRET reporters for measuring structural integrity. These DNA nanoparticles will be
microinjected into live cells cytosolic region and their breakage be determined. Last, the cytosolic stability
of these DNA nanoparticles will be correlated with different types of mammalian cells with known cytosolic
variability (tumor, immune, and other cell types) in order to map the role of structurally diverse DNA
nanoparticles in targeting cells with different physiologies. The PI will also receive training in rigorous
analysis of in vitro research, lab management, and the prolific grant writing process, which will facilitate
their transition to an independent research program. Outcomes of this project will pave the way towards
developing more bio-compatible delivery systems, specifically for functional nucleic acid therapeutic agents
that are vital in the cell cytosol."

Neural computation requires the coordinated effort of thousands of interrelated and often genetically similar
neurons. These neurons form physically intermingled networks and subnetworks that act together to amplify
and strengthen sensory perceptions or select motor action. Such co-active ensembles are known to be
preferentially interconnected, and may represent a functional element of neural processing with unique
properties, such as pattern completion and competition between ensembles. In this proposal I will gain a
mechanistic understanding of how ensembles of co-active neurons interact by probing the function of
individual and groups of neurons in an awake mouse. I will examine: how ensembles of pyramidal cells
interact with other pyramidal cells and local inhibitory neurons in a visual task, how these ensembles influence
motor behavior, and how specific ensembles respond to information from other cortical areas. Despite the
potential importance of ensembles in cortical coding, the intermixed nature of these groups has made them
particularly hard to study. While conventional optogenetic techniques can manipulate genetically identified
neurons in a region, they are incapable of selectively manipulating intermingled neurons that differ only by their
functional properties. Critically, new multiphoton optogenetic techniques are beginning to allow manipulation of
cells chosen by their activity alone, however such techniques require further development. In the K99 phase of
this proposal, I will continue my training through the development of novel optical systems for multiphoton
stimulation and through use of these technique understand cortical function. By combining these new optical
techniques with novel opsins designed for in vivo multiphoton use that I have already developed, I now have
the ability to write in or edit neural activity across many neurons with a precision never before possible. By
altering ensemble activity during visual perception I will determine the causal contributions of individual
neurons as well as populations of neurons to sensory coding. In the R00 phase, through manipulations in
motor cortex I will unravel the behavioral impact of these groups, probing the role motor ensembles play in
motor action, and study how neurons interact across modalities. The ability to both edit and monitor the activity
of neural subnetworks is critical to gaining a mechanistic understanding of perception and action. The
conclusions we draw from this proposal will help to describe how all information is presented in the cortex, but
can only be reached with advanced techniques."

Sleep is necessary for all brain function and ultimately life. The core function by which sleep contributes to
healthy cognition remains one of the great questions facing neuroscience. Recent theories point to powerful
cellular rules, but these are controversial and have difficulty accounting for the effects of sleep in ethologically
and developmentally diverse circumstances.
We recently showed that cortical circuit dynamics are actively tuned to criticality, a computational regime that
maximizes information processing. This regime is disrupted by changes in synaptic strength, such as those
believed to typify waking experience. This raises the intriguing possibility that the core mechanism by which
sleep benefits neural function is by restoring criticality. Our preliminary experiments support this hypothesis. The
overall goal of this project is to develop a new framework for understanding the neural impact of sleep and
experience at the level of network dynamics. We will continuously track 500-1000 single neurons in the brains
of freely behaving animals for up to six months. We will track sleep, wake, behavior, and neural dynamics across
the entire distribution of naturally occurring behavior. We will take advantage of this methodologically integrated
approach to understand how circuits in the brain maintain the stable computation necessary for cognition and
natural behavior on long time-scales.
In Aim 1, we will test the relationship between specific classes of behavior and criticality in underlying networks.
In Aim 2, we will test the impact of wake and sleep on criticality across the brain for the majority of an animal's
lifetime. In Aim 3, we will use a modelling-based approach to establish the mechanisms of criticality in the intact
brain. The results of this work will shed light on a long-standing gap in our knowledge of fundamental
neurobiology. Given the increasingly recognized role of sleep in a vast number of brain-related disorders, an
understanding of how sleep works will open the door to significant health-related progress in the future. This
work directly advances the mission of the BRAIN Initiative."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains the most common congenital malformation.
Therefore, attaining a mechanistic understanding of cardiomyocyte formation is crucial
for improving outcomes to structural heart disease. Post-translational modifications of
histones act to regulate cardiac chromatin structure and hence, the temporal and
spatial program of gene regulation during cardiac development. We have found that
SMYD1, a cardiomyocyte essential histone methyltransferase interacts with the
chromatin remodeling MLL4 class of Complex of Proteins ASsociated with Set1
(COMPASS) complex. SMYD1 has been shown to be essential for cardiac
development and as we show here, causes CHD. Like SMYD1, two of the core
components of the MLL4-COMPASS complex, KMT2D/MLL4 and KDM6a are essential
for cardiac development and cause CHD. The goal of the current application is to test
the central hypothesis that SMYD1 acts within the MLL4-COMPASS complex to clear
histones at cardiac enhancers prior to gene activation. This will be achieved by: 1) 2)
Determining the function of SMYD1 in the assembly and function of the cardiac MLL4-

A hallmark of developing neural systems is the guidance by spontaneous and experience-driven neural
activity for strengthening of some synaptic inputs and pruning of others to define topography of mature
neural circuits. We and others have established formation of the calyx of Held (CH) and its innervation of
principal neurons (PN) in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body as a model system to study neural circuit
development. We showed that that the CH:PN system, relative to other model systems, has precise onset
and short duration of strengthening and pruning to a topographically mature circuit by postnatal day 9, prior
to ear canal opening. Preliminary data demonstrates that suppression of spontaneous activity (SA) targeted
to the CH:PN synapse prevents key aspects of PN functional maturation.
 In this proposal we capitalize on this observation to define the functional and structural elements of
circuit construction so that we can identify those maturational events that depend on SA. Our research team
brings extensive experience with biophysical and physiological properties of this system, which we examine
at high (daily) temporal resolution. We leverage our experience with imaging and reconstruction of large
electron microscopy volumes to specify global aspects of initial circuit topography along with subcellular
detail as a precise structural framework to anchor our observations. We next explore cellular and molecular
mechanisms that transmit information about neural activity to maturational programs at high temporal
resolution, focused upon activity-dependent Ca2+ entry and phosphorylation of the constitutive transcription
factor CREB. These accumulated data can be correlated with better temporal precision than in other model
systems to provide deeper insight into causal relationships between SA and maturational events. Errors in
early neural circuit specification can result in generalized intellectual and social disabilities, which can have
auditory specific phenotypes as in autism spectrum disorders."

Many non-pharmacologic therapies (NPTs) such as massage, acupuncture, and chiropractic treatments are now covered for the treatment of back pain under Oregon Medicaid. However, racial and ethnic minorities access these treatments less often than white patients.

The study includes two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will capture primary care NPT referral practices and other elements of the back pain visit through examination of 7 years of electronic health records (EHRs) from 8 primary care clinics, comparing NPT referral and other management practice differences across non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic Medicaid patients with back pain; we will also conduct brief interviews with medical directors to understand the context of care in each clinic. In Aim 2, we will explore barriers and facilitators of NPT through 1:1 in-depth interviews with Black and Hispanic patients with recent visits for back pain. Aim 2 will conclude with the integration of quantitative and qualitative data.

This mixed methods study obtains information from the electronic health record (EHR) and directly from patient interviews across urban and rural primary care sites to explore factors that may influence uptake of NPT services differentially across racial and ethnic groups, including individual, clinic, and community factors."

manufacturing of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The modeling approach will be based and validated using
specific experimental evidence to enhance our process understanding and improve model performance and
utilization during the design phase. The proposed innovations stem from the following objectives that will be
delivered as the outcome of this project, namely, 1) To develop a multiscale model for perfusion bioreactor
capturing the effects of operating parameters and cell line characteristics on critical quality attributes (CQAs)
validated by experimental results; 2) To develop methods for optimizing continuous chromatographic operations,
including primary capture and polishing steps, under a range of process conditions for optimal clearance of
process- and product-related impurities; and 3) To develop predictive models that will enable determination of
optimal operating conditions with direct coupling of upstream and downstream units accounting for product
quality attributes.
To enable process control, which is the ultimate target of advanced manufacturing, we will explore the design
space and identify the relationships between critical process parameters (CPPs), critical material attributes
(CMAs), and targeted CQAs. We will develop predictive models for all the important unit operations, validated
by experiments, that can be used to determine the design space along with statistical analysis of experimental
data to identify all critical parameters/attributes. The validated models will then be used as a virtual tool to perform
risk assessment for in-plant downstream operations such as scale-up/start-up/shutdown and compare process
operating scenarios. In terms of combining the developed strategies, we envision the integration with a
continuous upstream facility to achieve a fully automated continuous biomanufacturing line exploring and

The proposed research is for the second competitive renewal of a long-term project to develop imaging
biomarkers for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Noninvasive outcome measures that provide unbiased
patient assessments and reliably evaluate drug responses in clinical trials are essential to develop curative

and secondary endpoints in a number of international clinical trials.
In this application one major objective is to extend our DMD work by focusing on older DMD patients with
advanced disease progression. More than 50% of the DMD population is nonambulant, yet there are few
outcome measures that permit their inclusion in clinical trials. We propose to 1) develop composite qMR
biomarkers using quantitative whole-body imaging and 2) validate novel qMR biomarkers that assess
respiratory muscle quality and can predict a decline in respiratory function, a major cause of death in muscular
dystrophies. We hypothesize that composite qMR biomarkers–statistical constructs that optimally combine fat
fraction measures in multiple muscles–are responsive across a wide range of motor abilities in DMD. We will
leverage the large (older) DMD cohort currently enrolled in the ImagingDMD natural history study to test these
two new qMR biomarkers for advanced disease stages.
We also propose to extend our biomarker development work to patients with Becker muscular dystrophy
(BMD), the milder allelic form of the disease. Breakthroughs in gene delivery and exon skipping technology
have resulted in production of truncated dystrophin in variable amounts, effectively converting the DMD
phenotype into BMD. These therapeutic developments are expected to change the landscape for the next
generation of DMD patients. Thus, to assist future trials targeting dystrophin restoration, we will examine the
critical relationship between dystrophin expression, mutation site and qMR biomarkers of muscle
quality in BMD patients, setting the stage for informed in vivo monitoring of dystrophin rescue across muscles.
This project addresses critical barriers in therapeutic development and provides the potential for a paradigm
shift in clinical trial design in DBMD. In addition, this project will help inform future molecular based therapies
and will address a missing piece in translational gene restoration in DMD. All natural history data are shared
with the community."
10907672,"This study addresses the unmet clinical needs for management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC). NMIBC represents ~75% of bladder cancer cases and has a favorable five-year survival rate, but
typically recurs (50-70% in 5 years) and progresses to muscle-invasive disease (MIBC, 10-30%). Intravesical
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the most effective therapy to prevent NMIBC recurrence and progression,
yet BCG has a 30% failure rate, with various adverse effects leading to intolerance. Two critical needs exist: 1)
a risk stratification tool to identify patients at high risk of recurrence and progression for early and aggressive
treatment, and 2) a response prediction tool to identify patients who are unresponsive or intolerant to BCG for
other treatment options. Our goal is to develop and validate risk-stratification and BCG-response tools by
incorporating molecular signatures into the current pathological system for optimal clinical care of NMIBC.
Transcriptome analysis is powerful to identify genes, and importantly, to define cancer molecular subtypes
associated with different therapeutic and prognostic outcomes. This approach has been applied in bladder
cancer but primarily focused on MIBC. Research on NMIBC is an unmet need. Building on the Bladder Cancer
Epidemiology, Wellness, and Lifestyle Study (Be-Well), one of the largest prospective cohorts of NMIBC
patients, we propose to conduct a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of NMIBC and examine the utility of
molecular subtypes with additional prognostic genes in predicting NMIBC treatment response and prognostic
outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that molecular signatures (i.e., molecular subtypes and/or other
genes) could unveil NMIBC heterogeneity and thus improve the current pathological classification
system for tailored NMIBC care. We will: Aim 1. Develop a risk stratification tool for NMIBC prognostic
outcomes by incorporating molecular subtypes, genes, clinicopathological and demographic factors. Primary
outcomes will be disease recurrence and progression, with survival explored. We will define molecular
subtypes and identify genes by NMIBC prognostic outcomes (1a), build risk prediction models in Be-Well
(n=928) (1b), validate molecular signatures and the risk-stratification tool in an independent validation cohort
(n=959) (1c), and explore the tool in sex and race specific groups in the pooled cohorts (1d). Aim 2. Develop a
response prediction tool for BCG outcomes by incorporating molecular subtypes, immune signatures, genes,
clinicopathological and demographic factors. Primary outcomes will be BCG unresponsive with BCG intolerant
explored. Given the high immunogenic nature of bladder cancer and BCG therapy, we will develop the BCG-
response prediction tool with further consideration of immune signatures in patients who received BCG in Be-
Well (n=426) and a validation cohort (n=691). We will explore characterization of molecular subtypes by sex,
race/ethnicity, and etiological risk factors. Clinical translation will be accelerated given the generation of
NMIBC-specific molecular signatures using NanoString in a large health care delivery system setting."

This grant is written to request funding to support the 18th International Congress on Combustion
By-Products and their Health Effects, also known as PIC to be held May 20-22nd, 2024 in
Durham, NC. This enduring and small conference provides a unique platform to share the latest
science and exchange ideas across and among a diverse group of researchers from various
fields, including academia, industry, and government officials. The goal of the Congress is to
foster interactions and collaborations in a more narrowly focused research field compared to other
large discipline-specific scientific conferences that have a larger breadth and parallel session
formats. The Congress is held biennially and brings together scholars and researchers from
diverse fields such as chemistry, toxicology, engineering, epidemiology, and occupational and
public health to bear on a variety of issues related to combustion and thermal processes.
Participants are international and hail from academia, government, and industry research groups.
Given the focus on combustion byproducts and health, this Congress has a long-standing
affiliation with the Superfund Research Program (SRP). The SRP has long supported research
on combustion products found at legacy Superfund sites, but also due to natural and accidental
fires that lead to exposure to hazardous chemicals. Due to failing infrastructure, accidental and
transportation fires (e.g. fires associated with train derailments), can significantly impact the local
environment and increase concern about health impacts on the surrounding communities.
Additionally, hazardous materials found at Superfund sites can produce combustion-derived
pollutants that deserve specialized research and investigation that is not normally afforded to the
originally abandoned material. However, for this Congress, combustion is used in the broadest
sense of the word and includes all forms of thermal reactions, even those used to produce energy
or remediate wastes. Thus, it will also include discussions on the generation and health effects of
toxic by-products from other thermal reactions including energy recovery, materials recovery, and
climate change aspects as it pertains to the combustion emission and environmental health."

This proposal requests support to facilitate the attendance and participation of underrepresented groups,
women, and early career scientists to the Cellular and Molecular Fungal Biology Gordon Research Conference
and Seminar to be held at the Holderness School, June 16-21, 2024. Fungi are major causes of morbidity
especially among immunocompromised patient populations and yet the arsenal of treating fungal infections is
limited. Insight into the broad mechanisms of fungal communication with hosts, the environment, and other
microbes is essential for the advancement of treatment against fungal infections. The broad and long-term
goal of the conference is to disseminate information about fungal pathogenesis and biology among an
interdisciplinary group of researchers, and to increase our collective understanding of basic fungal biology and
its application to medically important problems. The specific aim of this meeting is to convene 50 speakers
and 10 discussion leaders who represent the leading edge of fungal research and to increase participation by
underrepresented groups, women, students, and postdocs that will fuel the future of fungal biology research. A
total of ~150 participants, most of whom will present posters, will gather for a five-day conference in a setting
with few distractions. The GRS is organized entirely by early career investigators and will be held on Saturday
and Sunday before the start of the GRC, and includes a keynote lecture, a career development session, two
poster sessions, and three oral sessions with presenters selected from the submitted abstracts. Both the GRS
and GRC oral and poster sessions are designed to emphasize discussion and networking, and evaluations
from past conferences demonstrate the effectiveness of this format. The 2024 meeting will combine the core
topics that underpin this area of research with newly emerging research topics, such as sessions focusing on
genomics, pathogenesis, symbiosis, responses to the environment and interactions with other microbes. These
topics are all integral to understanding fungal pathogenesis and to develop novel therapeutics. The
significance of this application is the demonstrated effect of this conference in accelerating research in the
national and international fungal biology community, particularly in the areas of fungal-host interactions,
evolution, and microbial communities that directly impact on endeavors such as fungal disease
treatment and the development of anti-fungal therapeutics."

ALS is a complex disease with diverse genetic etiologies. Although drugs targeting known causal mutations
(e.g. SOD1 ASOs) may treat individual forms of ALS, this approach cannot address the vast majority of cases
with unknown genetic etiology. Moreover, the large number of causal genes and rarity of each genetic form
suggest that treating ALS will require many patient-specific therapies or broadly-effective treatments. Thus,
there is a pressing need for new, scalable approaches that identify patient-specific or broadly-effective
therapeutic strategies for multiple forms of ALS, particularly those with unknown genetic etiologies.
Studies using induced motor neurons (iMNs) from iPSCs indicate that iMNs from most ALS patients, including
those without known mutations, display ALS disease phenotypes including rapid degeneration. We performed
phenotypic screening on ALS iMNs to identify the most efficacious therapeutic targets. However, iMN drug
responses are heterogeneous across patient lines, and probing disease mechanisms and drug responses on a
sufficient number of lines is prohibitively expensive and labor intensive. In this transformative project, we will
overcome this critical barrier in ALS drug discovery by combining ALS iPSC disease modeling with GENEVA, a
novel platform we developed for cancer therapeutics that uses single cell transcriptomics to assess drug
effects on dozens of patient lines in one dish. GENEVA uses SNP-based computational demultiplexing of
single-cell RNA-seq data to profile responses to therapies across pools of many iPSC lines. We developed
computational tools that analyze the high-content readout of scRNA-seq to (i) precisely quantify the sensitivity
of every line based on its representation within the population in the case and control arm, (ii) identify the
molecular mechanisms that underlie the response to the drug and possible mechanisms of resistance, and (iii)
reveal differences in response between subpopulations as a result of heterogeneity within every line. GENEVA
will increase the scale of ALS lines in drug discovery by 10-50-fold and reveal disease and drug response
mechanisms at single cell resolution, enabling the discovery of new therapeutic targets with either broad
efficacy or high patient specificity. Using this “population-in-a-dish” approach, GENEVA-ALS will identify
neurodegenerative and drug response mechanisms across ALS patient cohorts at an unprecedented
scale, removing a critical bottleneck in ALS drug discovery. The proposed study will 1) establish the
GENEVA-ALS population-in-a-dish platform, 2) establish temporal maps of iMN disease processes for 45 ALS
lines, 3) validate 3 therapeutic targets with novel mechanisms of action that show broad efficacy across ALS
iMN lines, 4) determine if GENEVA-ALS can predict efficacy in ALS patients in a phase 2 clinical trial, and 5)
identify new therapeutic targets in a genome-wide CRISPRi screen on 30 ALS lines. Our study seeks to shift
current research by overcoming the critical barrier of patient heterogeneity in drug discovery."
10907758,"Project Summary
Radiation therapy delivered at ultra-high dose rates may be becoming a breakthrough treatment option for cancer
patients. Targeting cancers with ultra-high radiation dose rates produces a FLASH effect, wherein control of
tumor growth is maintained similarly to conventional (CONV) radiation dose rates, but normal tissue toxicity is
significantly reduced. Although FLASH irradiation has been shown to evoke strong, reproducible responses
across many different organ systems (e.g., brain, lungs, gastrointestinal [GI] tract, skin) across multiple species,
some studies have shown that ultra-high-dose rate irradiation to have either no effect or detrimental effects on
normal tissue. This discrepancy is not clear; however, it likely stems from inconsistency in the physical radiation
beam and fractionation parameters. Furthermore, although previous studies have shown either no change in or
improved tumor responses from FLASH irradiation as compared with CONV dose rate irradiation, no studies
have looked beyond simple tumor growth delay when evaluating tumor responses. A more relevant analysis for
preclinical tumor responses to radiotherapy is the Tumor Control (TCD50) assay, and to date, no comparisons
between FLASH and CONV dose rate irradiation on the dose required to cure 50% of tumors (TCD50) have been
performed. The lack of comparisons of radiation types, the lack of consistency between physical radiation beam
parameters and fractionation, and the lack of accurate measurements of tumor control in previous FLASH
irradiation studies provides impetus to conduct this rigorous, high throughput, multi-institutional study to provide
confirmatory evidence of the reproducibility of FLASH effects. This proposed project will test the hypothesis that
there is an optimal set of physical beam parameters that will maximize the FLASH effect, and that under the
same dose parameters and the same physical dose, the FLASH effect dose response will be the same between
different radiation types. In order to test the hypothesis, Aim 1 will focus on determining whether radiation type
(e.g., electrons, photons, and photons) alters abdominal FLASH-mediated normal tissue-sparing effects, with
the expectation of similar responses to the different radiation types. In order to optimize the physical beam and
fractionation parameters to maximally reduce normal tissue toxicity, physical beam parameters (e.g., mean dose
rate, dose per pulse, pulse duration, overall delivery time, priming dose, and oxygen tension) as well as
fractionation will be systematically changed and tested (Aim 2). Aim 3 will focus on establishing the therapeutic
effects of FLASH dose rate irradiation mediate similar control of syngeneic, heterotopic tumors of three different
cancer cell lines using the more relevant TCD50 assay. The overarching goal of this project is to minimize side
effects for all cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, which will inevitably improve quality of life. Preventing
the post-treatment effects of radiation therapy in cancer patients so that individuals can live longer, and more
fulfilling lives is in direct alignment with the mission of the National Cancer Institute."
10939001,"Project Summary
Common genetic variation is an important player in human diseases. One central goal of human genetic studies
is to identify causal genetic variants in diseases and understand the mechanism. Many genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify associations between genetic variants and a myriad of human
diseases. However, moving from GWAS results to identification of causal variants, and a mechanistic
understanding of how the variants elicit diseases remains a major challenge in the field. This challenge is what
I aim to address in my research program. Recent research efforts have led to the generation of large scale
functional genomic datasets, in particular single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data. Because most common
variants are located in noncoding genomic regions and their functional effects are mostly unknown, such
functional genomic datasets have the potential to provide important information about the variant’s functional
role, for example if a variant has gene regulatory effect, which cell or tissue type it has an effect in, if such an
effect is related to diseases, etc. However, the current methods and analyses used by researchers in the field
are unable to garner such information from existing data, so critical gaps in connecting variants to diseases exist.
The overall goal of the PI’s research program is to develop the new statistical methods and analyses needed to
leverage functional genomics data, in conjunction with GWAS data, to understand variants’ functional effects
and their roles in diseases. This goal will be achieved by advancing three key areas: (i) Identification of response
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), which are genetic variants that are associated with gene expression
only under certain conditions. A powerful response QTL mapping pipeline will be established and used to study
response QTL properties and relevance to diseases. (ii) Identification of disease critical cell states using single-
cell chromatin accessibility profiling data. Single-cell chromatin accessibility profiling data provide a high-
resolution view of cellular regulatory landscapes; novel methods will be established to assess the relevance of
these different cellular states to diseases. (iii) Identification of effect context for individual causal variants. A
variant may affect a disease through one or a few cell/tissue types relevant to the disease, but this is often not
known. Work in this third research area will establish a statistical model that leverages multiple types of functional
genomics datasets to address this question. The PI’s work in these areas will yield critical insights about the
effect of genetic variation and disease etiology. New approaches and open-source tools for studying common
genetic variants and disease genetics will be established. These tools are greatly needed by the research
community to make full and effective use of the fast-accumulating functional genomics and GWAS datasets."

Ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) enable cells to fine-tune their intracellular space based on environmental
cues and cell-cell communication. Because of their role in regulating cells, dysregulation of LGICs is a major
contributor to human diseases. LGICs function through binding chemicals in their extracellular domain, which
opens their ion channel, enabling ion flux into cells. The mechanisms of how this occurs is referred to as gating.
Because LGIC function enables our cells to react to environmental cues, they must gate on a rapid, millisecond
timescale for proper function. However, it is unknown how LGIC gating occurs on this timescale because
technological limitations have precluded the physiological mechanisms of gating from being studied. In addition,
the function of LGICs is tightly regulated by auxiliary proteins in cells, which localize the function of LGICs in
cells and provide a mechanism for cells to further control gating. Despite the importance of auxiliary subunits to
fine-tune LGIC function, the mechanisms of how auxiliary subunits regulate LGICs are unclear. Furthermore,
how therapeutics regulate LGIC function is unknown. Our research addresses these major knowledge gaps and
will uncover the mechanisms of how LGICs gate, how function is regulated, and provide vital foundations for
targeting LGICs with therapeutics to treat human diseases. To initiate our research, we are focusing on AMPA
receptors (AMPARs), which are a subtype of LGIC that mediate neuronal communication, and dysregulation of
AMPARs is a major driver of neurological diseases. To understand how AMPARs function on a physiological
timescale, we developed a time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) approach that enables us to study
AMPAR and LGIC function with millisecond resolution in this proposed research. Our research here will form the
molecular and structural basis of how AMPARs gate. We will also elucidate how AMPAR gating and localization
is regulated by auxiliary subunit proteins, which is a major regulation mechanism of AMPAR function, but the
details are unknown. We will uncover these mechanisms with cryo-EM, biophysics, and electrophysiology. We
will also use these approaches to understand the mechanisms of how therapeutic molecules alter AMPAR
function. Collectively, our findings will uncover the precise molecular details into how AMPARs function and how
AMPARs are regulated in health and disease, as well as provide us with critical avenues for studying LGICs in
our future research."

research; 2) Dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, translating research into practice in academic
and community settings; and 3) fostering the patient voice in all aspects of clinical research, starting with the
study question, extending to representing patients’ input in the data acquisition process to ensure that data
collected is relevant to patients, and bridging to implementation so that that patient views are well represented.
Engagement with the DICE Core will be facilitated in part by our Patient Advisory Committee and through
tested structures to engage patients in pre- and post-award roles.
Specific Aim 3: To comprehensively coordinate our CCCR’s activities, effectively leverage institutional
resources (e.g. the UAB CCTS) and promote training for both early and established investigators in state-of-

 The overall goal of our BIGDATA Methods and Health Informatics (MHI) Core is to support rigorous and
efficient research especially related to type 3 and type 4 translation research with a sub-theme of health equity.
Our CCCR's selection of the sub-theme of health equity and community engagement was motivated by the
heightened awareness that historically marginalized populations are disproportionately affected by chronic
conditions including rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs), especially in the Deep South. We
recognize that translating research into clinical care and community settings is key for improving outcomes of
patients with RMDs. We propose to achieve this by offering services in pragmatic study design including
optimization trial designs, data capture that is simpler, faster, and less costly, and state-of-the-art data
analysis. Our proposed MHI Core has gathered a diverse team with expertise in biostatistics, clinical
informatics, machine learning including natural language processing, epidemiology, software
development, and implementation science. Our expertise in offering optimization trial designs within the
Multiphase Optimization Strategy such as Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials will facilitate
development of patient-centered scalable and sustainable interventions that can support the goal of health
equity. We have amassed a breath of software tools to support data capture in different settings and data
resources to embed research into routine care as well as to scale infrastructure nationally to foster real-world
evidence generation. To this end, the MHI Core will support the new Dissemination, Implementation for
Community Engagement (DICE) Resource Core with tools that enhance recruitment of underserved
populations (focused on a diverse array of study types) and support pragmatic effectiveness and
implementation science studies. MHI Core's focus is to advance the NIAMS research mission and the ongoing/
future investigations of the BIGDATA user base via the following specific aims: 1) To support the selection
and implementation of study designs for BIGDATA investigators pursuing NIAMS-related research
(Study Design); 2) To expand the range of data sources available to RMD researchers and provide
electronic data capture support for their studies (Data Capture and Data Engineering); and 3) To
provide data analysis consultation and support for studies related to NIAMS-related research (Data
Analysis). We are uniquely prepared and strongly committed to scientific rigor, innovation, and development of
new knowledge and translational techniques clinically relevant to the NIAMS mission. Our strengths in study
design and rigorous state-of-the-art analysis coupled with the data capture and data engineering software, and
data resources we already support will enable our investigator base to foster knowledge that is generalizable

10928159,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A tumor biopsy is traditionally performed for lung cancer diagnosis using either bronchoscopy through the airway
or a needle aspiration through the chest wall. Advances in targeted and immune therapies now often require
more tissue for molecular and immune profiling to optimally manage lung cancer. The yield for cancer diagnosis
using modern bronchoscopic tools approaches only 50% across the spectrum of lung tumors biopsied, and the
additional requirement for molecular and immune profiling erodes this yield further. This leads to delayed and
suboptimal care, increased healthcare costs, and increased patient morbidity since patients can often require
multiple procedures to obtain the correct information for treatment. Our group has recently demonstrated that
targeted Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) – or a washing of the lung cancer performed during a procedure – is a
reservoir of genomic and cellular biomarkers in the lung tumor macroenvironment (TMaE). Further, we have
demonstrated that molecular analyses of BAL from the lung TMaE recapitulate cancer biology in the lung tumor
microenvironment (TMiE). While BAL is very safe and routinely performed during bronchoscopy, to date, it is a
pauci-cellular fluid that is of limited clinical utility for cancer diagnosis. Beyond cytology that is low yield, there
are no molecular or cellular assays that are used in the clinic to fully inform providers who treat lung cancer.
Because of this, rigorous attention to how methods of collection, patient host factors and processing of BAL will
alter genomic and high dimensional cell based assays is lacking. Our central hypothesis is: BAL globally
samples the tumor microenvironment (TMiE) to overcome limitations of tumor heterogeneity and is more
sensitive than blood for immunogenomic profiling due to increased quantities of tumor specific
biomarkers. To realize our goal and prove our hypothesis, in depth analysis of the conditions affecting BAL for
high dimensional genome and cell assays is required. Here, we propose studying how basic conditions in the
lung, variations in acquisition of BAL, and storage and processing of BAL affect its utility for comprehensive
genome profiling and analysis of the T cell repertoire. Following identification of key pre-analytic variables, we
propose a standard operating procedure for implementation in observational biomarker and first-in-man clinical
trials to demonstrate the clinical utility of our approach. Proposal success will facilitate the introduction of novel
molecular assays into the clinic that augment extant and developing blood and tumor assays. This approach will
be particularly relevant as we move into the era of precision guided therapies for lung cancer treatment, which
have begun to reduce mortality in even the most advanced stages, over the coming years and decades."
10930075,"The first objective is to determine how multi-generational ambient temperature, specifically thermoneutral temperature, modulates the metabolic health of parents and subsequently programs the metabolic health of the next generation. The hypothesis is that prolonged exposure to thermoneutral ambient temperature will lead to dysfunctional adipose tissue and impair the metabolic health of parents, resulting in an increased predisposition to obesity in the offspring. Preliminary data from pilot studies have already shown significant 
changes in the weight gain ability and adipose tissue morphology of offspring born to thermoneutral temperature housed parents to that offspring born to cold temperature housed parents. The second objective aims to identify the impact of parental housing temperature on the inflammatory profile of offspring adipose tissue, with a focus on understanding the role of parental temperature exposure in 
modulating adipose tissue inflammation programming. It is hypothesized that the inflammatory response in offspring adipose tissue will differ between adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction based on parental housing temperature. Preliminary data showed that changes in parental ambient temperature resulted in changes in the expression of genes involved in immune response in offspring adipose tissue. By pursuing these specific aims, we aim to gain a better understanding of how ambient temperature modulation during 
parental stages influences the metabolic programming of offspring. The findings have the potential to uncover new mechanisms and interventions to reduce the risk of obesity and associated health complications, ultimately contributing to improved public health outcomes in high-income countries."
10929322,"This program project will involve high-throughput experiments, including whole genome sequencing (WGS),
RNA sequence profiling on cell populations (RNA-seq), perturbation RNA profiling (Perturb-seq), and CRISPR
screens. These studies will generate substantial quantities of data requiring secure, reliable storage and
computational analysis. Data derived from human research participants require a data security level suitable
for their sensitive nature. Secure and sufficient computational and information resources are crucial for
facilitating efficient, consistent, and reproducible analyses for all projects. Storing all data from the program
project centrally enables data provenance tracking, data sharing, and integration. Shared computing supports
consistent analysis pipelines, with a single resource responsible for maintaining current versions of databases
and software. A bioinformatics specialist performing routine analyses will allow researchers in each project to
focus on novel research endeavors. We plan to support the three project components and the three other
cores with the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Provide informatics infrastructure to enable reproducible and secure data analyses. Core B will
provide a secure and reliable informatics infrastructure to support foundational data analyses for the projects. A
key component of the computing environment will be a server with sufficient compute cycles and memory for
both routine analyses and novel research activities of the projects. This secure environment will include online
disk storage for all raw and processed project data and analysis code. This core will implement a well-designed
backup system including regular onsite and offsite backup of project data. Software packages and necessary
public and licensed databases will be deployed and kept current. The entire compute environment will be
secured by a modern firewall, with systems accessed via VPN. A system administrator will maintain the
computing system, including backup, and will support users from the collaborating institutes.
Aim 2: Perform routine bioinformatics analyses for each Project. A bioinformatics specialist in Core B will
provide basic computational analyses for genome and transcriptome data. Statistical researchers in Core B will
develop innovative robust statistical methods for Perturb-seq in Project 3, and creative pipelines for all studies.
To enable consistent and reproducible analyses for all projects, this core will deploy a robust software
infrastructure to manage all data, record its provenance, and track all results. The core will perform
preprocessing, quality control, annotation, and other routine analysis steps for WGS, transcriptome
sequencing, CRISPR screens, and characterization of specificity and efficiency of gene correction. Core B will
also help maintain a public resource of genes and regulatory regions related to T cell deficiencies. Core B will
facilitate researchers in all projects and cores with deposition of all datasets into the appropriate public
databases and repositories, with all appropriate metadata."
10929325,"Several primary immunodeficiencies, including severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), are characterized
by T cell deficits. Elucidating the etiology of T cell deficits provides opportunities to understand the biology of T
cell development and inform diagnosis and treatment of individuals with T cell deficiency disorders. Current
exome approaches solve <50% of cases of T cell deficiencies. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers an
opportunity to develop a more comprehensive approach for variant discovery, with superior coverage of exons,
as well as new access to noncoding sequences, allowing for interrogation of genomic regulatory variation.
Interpretation of WGS is enabled by known genes and regulatory regions associated with particular disease
phenotypes. To this end, in Aim 1 we will predict putative genes and regulatory regions associated with T cell
disorders. These will be evaluated by CRISPR screens in Project 2 and more detailed studies in Project 3.
The integrated results will provide a resource for the field of immunology, and will directly inform our diagnostic
WGS interpretation.
For Aim 2, we will identify candidate disease-causing variants in affected individuals, and stratify these for
experimental validation and interrogation. Drawing upon the resource in Aim 1, we will establish an analysis
pipeline that solves cases from probands' WGS. We will stratify our conclusions based on degree of
confidence in the computational studies, in order to inform different experiments for Projects 2 and 3 or Aim 3.
This pipeline will have quantitative integrative scoring, and will consider both protein altering and regulatory
single nucleotide variants and small indels, as well as structural variations (especially deletions). We will
prioritize variants based on severity of predicted effect, gene relevance to T cell deficiencies, and consistency
with proband phenotype (from Core C). “Compelling” cases where validation of causative variants is likely,
may proceed to investigations of molecular mechanism in Project 3, while “intriguing” cases yielding dozens of
variants need testing via medium-scale studies in Project 2. “Mysterious” cases with numerous variants of
unknown significance will first be examined through Aim 3 RNA-seq, and then proceed to Projects 2 and 3.
For Aim 3, we will integrate trio RNA-seq to identify regulatory splicing and expression variants related to T cell
deficiency disease. The impact of most putative regulatory variants cannot be reliably predicted today.
However, transcriptome profiling, which reveals both RNA expression level and splicing events, is an effective
method to assess the regulatory consequences of genetic variations. Transcriptomes from parents will be
studied for inferring those of the probands, when T cells are not available due to the disease. We will identify
variants associated with altered splicing, as well as regulatory variants associated with allele-specific altered
expression. These data will be incorporated into the Aim 2 genome interpretation pipeline, to identify variants
for further investigations in Projects 2 and 3."
10929328,"Mutations in over 350 genes have been implicated as drivers of primary immunodeficiency (PID), but the genes
that are mutated to cause many of these rare, but clinically serious conditions remain unknown, even despite
whole exome sequencing. The use of whole genome sequencing promises to reveal coding and non-coding
mutations for cases of T lymphocyte deficiency that cannot be solved by whole exome sequencing. However,
confidently distinguishing pathogenic PID mutations from the exceedingly large number of benign variants across
the entire genome is daunting, due to the rare incidence of each PID, incomplete knowledge of the genes
required for T cell development, and our lack sequence-based rules to predict which non-coding variants may
be pathogenic. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing combined with our in vitro T cell differentiation platform offers
unprecedented opportunities to test directly how human genetic sequences control immune cell development
from hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs) and ultimately to arrive at new therapies consisting of rewriting
mutations that cause human immune diseases in patient blood-forming cells. Progress in pinpointing each
patient’s causal mutation will open the next frontier: precise non-viral correction of endogenous disease-causing
mutations for autologous gene therapy in HSPCs, avoiding the necessity to use imperfectly matched allogeneic
donor transplants, for which graft rejection and graft vs. host disease are potentially devastating complications.
This project will develop high-efficiency, high-throughput CRISPR-based technologies for identification of
essential genes T for cell development, rapid functional testing of candidate mutations, and therapeutic genetic
correction of a patient’s own HSPCs. We have developed CRISPR-Cas9 as a molecular scalpel to edit specific
genome sequences in primary human cells and recently improved this technology for therapeutically-relevant
editing in HPSCs. We will further apply CRISPR-based technologies for high-throughput mapping of coding and
non-coding mutations in genes related to SCID and other forms of T-cell deficient PID, and we will develop new
technologies for therapeutic gene editing in primary human HSPCs. Thus this project’s three central aims
address fundamental challenges to achieving cures for PID through gene editing: 1) Discovery of all gene
perturbations that could result in T cell deficiency, 2) Rapid identification of causal mutations for PID cases with
unsolved genetic basis, and 3) Improvement in technology to introduce efficient and specific gene corrections
into primary HPSCs as a forerunner to personalized autologous gene correction to restore immune function."

10929330,"ABSTRACT
Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is the most lethal of the autoimmune diseases. The primary causes of SSc-related
mortality are the complications of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), with
skin disease being a significant contributor to morbidity. Using the complimentary and existing strengths of
multiple divisions and Schools within the University of Pittsburgh, Core B is crucial to providing the resources,
expertise and support to help the overall program goal of synergistic research projects studying SSc and its
important complications of ILD, PAH and skin thickening in the proposed translational research program. In
order to accomplish this, Core B has the following four Specific Aims: Aim 1: To provide a clinical data repository
of longitudinally-followed SSc patients to accompany the blood and skin biologic specimens to support Projects
#1, #2, and #3. This will use the longstanding and recognized University of Pittsburgh observational SSc cohort
clinical and matching serum databank. This 40-year observational cohort will facilitate the linking of both cross-
sectional and longitudinal clinical data with biospecimens for mechanistic studies and statistical modeling. Aim
2: To enrich our current repository of lung and skin tissue, cells, precision cut slices, and serum procured from
normal individuals and individuals with SSc for application in Projects #1, #2, and #3. In this Aim skin from
patients with diffuse SSc, explanted lung tissue from SSc patients undergoing lung transplant and skin and lung
healthy controls/donors will undergo state-of the art molecular biological analysis, especially single cell analysis,
histopathological characterization, and cell and tissue model generation which will be used to support all three
scientific projects. Aim 3: To assist program investigators from Projects #1, #2, and #3 in the design and
implementation of experiments using biological specimens and models from the Biobank. Core B will provide
expertise in the development and standardization of new protocols and technique for cell and tissue-based ex
vivo models, implement proper setups to ensure the successful evaluation of mechanistic pathways and
therapeutic interventions for SSc, and perform gold standard SSc-specific serum autoantibody testing to be
included in statistical analysis. Aim 4: To provide the investigators in Projects #1, #2 and #3 with the statistical
support required to successfully complete the analyses and linking of clinical data."
10929331,"The overall aim of this Program Project is to integrate the expertise of its members in a comprehensive effort to
exploit bioinformatic and genomic advances to enable not only identification of disease-causing variants
discovered through population-based newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), but
also to develop genome editing as a personalized approach to treatment. Whole exome sequencing (WES) and
whole genome sequencing (WGS) identify multiple candidate variants (Project 1; Cores B and C) that must
then be screened to identify the pathogenic variant(s) responsible for T cell insufficiency. After Project 2 employs
CRISPR-based screening in normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells to identify genes that are important
for T cell development, Project 3 will integrate all of the findings from the program into a unifying model of human
T cell development. Investigators Brenner, Puck, and Wiest have already collaborated to integrate bioinformatic
variant calling with functional validation in zebrafish and human hematopoietic cells to identify BCL11B as a
novel SCID gene and investigate its mode of action (Punwani et al, NEJM, 2016). This approach will be
amplified to perform high-throughput analysis of hundreds of variants. Project 3 Aim 1 will establish a molecular
map of human T cell development by characterizing the differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells (HSPC) in vitro using single-cell RNASeq. The molecular map will then be enriched by using
loss-of-function analysis to assess the role in T cell development of known SCID genes and additional, novel
genes determined by Project 2 to play an essential role in human T cell development. We will do so using
Perturb-seq, a novel method that links loss-of-function of individual genes to single cell expression signatures at
sequential stages of differentiation. This approach provides not only a precise definition of the developmental
stage of arrest based on the expression signature, but also insight into the mechanism of arrest in a manner that
transcends the limited resolution afforded by flow cytometry analysis of the heterogeneous hematopoietic
intermediates (Adamson et al, Cell, 2016). Indeed, Perturb-seq will enable us to establish groups of genes that
are co-expressed during T cell development, and to test the epistatic relationships between these genes at each
developmental stage. In Aim 2, we will perform functional analysis on candidate disease-causing coding variants
using both the zebrafish and human HSPC models. We will employ the zebrafish embryo model to determine if
a particular coding variant actually damages the function of a gene product sufficiently to block T cell
development in vivo, and whether other organs are also affected. In addition, we will perform in depth mechanistic
analysis on the 3-4 highest priority variants, as insight gained from this analysis will help to inform the variant
nomination process in Project 1. Collectively, these efforts will markedly advance our understanding of human
T cell development, which will drive optimization of the discovery, mechanistic understanding and treatment of
human SCID and related diseases."
10929336,"Skin fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc) leads to significant morbidity resulting from disfiguring, painful and itchy
skin, and joint contractures. We have recently shown by single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) that SSc
dermal fibroblasts (expressing increased THBS1, PRSS23) and dermal myofibroblasts (also expressing
increased SFRP4, ADAM12, TNFSF18 and CTGF) arise from SFRP2-expressing progenitors found in healthy
control skin. These studies provide a framework for understanding the profibrotic drivers of these cell states.
Transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal in regulating gene expression and provide a powerful landmark for these
cell states. Using SCENIC, a computational method developed for detecting TF-associated regulatory networks
(regulons) in single cell datasets, we identified putative TFs driving myofibroblast differentiation: FOXP1, HIF1A,
IRF7, STAT1 and FOSL2. Additionally, in preliminary results we employed Assay for Transposase Accessible
Chromatin by Sequencing (scATAC-seq) data supporting the importance of these TFs in SSc myofibroblast
differentiation. In our first aim, we will assess the importance of these TFs in further multiome studies, and confirm
their roles in myofibroblast differentiation by measuring the effects of TF knock-down on fibroblast transcriptome
and epigenome. Markers of macrophage activation correlate strongly with the main clinical measure of skin
disease severity, the modified Rodnan skin score (MRSS), suggesting that macrophages deliver profibrotic
signals to drive myofibroblast differentiation. Recent studies in SSc-ILD have confirmed IL-6 in pathogenesis of
lung disease and we see its downstream target CCL18 also upregulated in skin macrophages. In our second
aim, we will use a novel system biology methodology, CausER, to analyze latent factors regulating the
macrophage-fibroblast interaction and generate snRNA-seq data before and after tocilizumab to better
understand the role of IL-6 in activating profibrotic macrophages in SSc skin. We expect that this will inform the
similar process occurring in SSc-interstitial lung disease. Localized scleroderma (LS) continues to cause
disfiguring and functional disabilities in children as well as adults. Our preliminary results implicate IFNg as
activating macrophages and fibroblasts in LS skin. In aim 3, using similar approaches to study of SSc, we will
compare the immune and non-immune cell populations in LS to SSc skin. First, we will combine our existing LS
(n=14), SSc (n=27) and healthy control (n=14) scRNA-seq datasets, and examine differences in fibroblast and
myeloid cell transcriptome-phenotypes and differentially expressed genes. Then as in aim 2, we will employ
CausER to identify latent factors regulating the interaction between these cells. We will then identify TFs
regulating myeloid and fibroblast phenotypes using SCENIC and multiome. We expect these studies of LS to
provide new insights into the cytokines and intracellular pathways activating myofibroblasts that lead to skin
fibrosis in these patients. The proposed studies will be strongly supported by clinical and biosample collection
through Core B and the systems biology expertise by Drs. Singh and Das in core C."
10907414,"This Multi-PI project combines the efforts of two research groups with different areas of expertise to address the
long-term goal of developing bioengineered corneal stroma and endothelial tissues to provide therapy for
individuals with corneal blindness. These tissues will be bioengineered from adult stem cells, which can be
obtained from the individuals to be treated as autologous or from allogeneic cell storage since the stem cells are
immunosuppressive. Over the past 5 years we have demonstrated that organization of these cells into tissues
can be guided by scaffolds constructed of native extracellular matrix proteins, fabricated using a biomimetic,
surface-induced assembly process. The Du Lab at the University of Pittsburgh will obtain stem cells from limbal
stroma of donated human corneas. Their extensive work with these corneal stromal stem cells (CSSC) shows
that they differentiate to stromal keratocytes and to corneal endothelial cells, tissues responsible for most corneal
opacity. We have demonstrated that CSSC can be obtained from biopsy samples, presenting the opportunity to
generate patient-specific, autologous bioengineered tissues. The Feinberg Lab at Carnegie Melon University
has developed novel approach of assembling native extracellular matrix proteins to produce tissue-like
scaffolding with defined 3-D architecture. Aim 1 will build on our previous work, which has showed that we can
engineer spatial and biochemical cues provided by the scaffolding to generate stroma-like tissue from CSSCs
that can be stacked to form multilamellar 3-D tissue similar to that of the corneal stroma. Bioengineered stroma
produced in the proposed experiments will be subjected to biomechanical loading to simulate cornea
development and further improve mechanical and optical properties. Function of the bioengineered stroma in
lamellar keratoplasty will be evaluated in an in vivo rabbit model. Aim 2 will build on our work differentiating
CSSC into endothelial cells and growing these on engineered basement membrane protein scaffolds to form
polygonal monolayers that express genes typical of corneal endothelium. Previously, we demonstrated the ability
to create the equivalent of Descemet's membrane to bioengineer an entire sheet of endothelium suitable for
lamellar keratoplasty, but we also developed an alternative approach to engineer small patches of endothelium
and deliver these via simple injection. Bioengineered endothelium produced in the proposed studies will use
our newly developed “shrink-wrapping” technology to create microscale patches of corneal endothelium that can
be injected into the anterior chamber for injury-free engraftment. Functionality of the constructs will be
demonstrated in rabbit models in vivo, focused on boosting cell-density to improve pump function as an
alternative to lamellar keratoplasty for endothelial disease. This project will build on the innovative experimental
approaches we developed during the first 5 years of this project. Importantly, tissues developed and validated in
vivo during this proposed study hold the potential of being advanced into clinically relevant studies to provide a
novel therapeutic approach to the age-old problem of corneal blindness."

 The Blackwell lab studies mechanisms that maintain metabolic, protein, and lipid homeostasis, primarily
by leveraging the advantages of the model organism C. elegans. Much of our work involves SKN-1, the C.
elegans ortholog of the NRF (NF-E2-related factor) transcription factors, which respond to oxidative,
xenobiotic, proteasomal, and certain metabolic stresses. NIGMS has supported our efforts almost
continuously since 1994. Having pioneered work on SKN-1 as an NRF protein model, we have shown that
these proteins play important roles in promoting longevity and elucidated a number of intriguing and conserved
aspects of their functions. This MIRA covers the majority of our work on SKN-1, aside from a separate project
investigating specific functions of the SKN-1A isoform (NRF1 ortholog) in lipid homeostasis.
 During the next five years this MIRA research will address a set of exciting and interrelated aspects of
SKN-1 functions, building upon opportunities provided by our recent findings. It has become clear that fully
delineating the functions of the two major SKN-1 isoforms (SKN-1A and SKN-1C) is critical and will be very
informative because they correspond directly to NRF proteins with distinct functions and regulation (NRF1 and
NRF2, respectively). To this end, we will generate necessary mutations and address the unmet need of
identifying SKN-1C functions in a variety of contexts where skn-1 is critical. We have determined that when
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is subject to stress from impairment of disulfide crosslinking the response is
distinct from the canonical ER unfolded protein response, apparently because reactive oxygen species
generation is elevated. Elucidating this response, which we have named the ER disulfide relay response
(DRRER), and which involves SKN-1 isoforms directly, will yield new insights into an unanticipated aspect of ER
homeostasis. No analyses of stress responses have investigated their effects on the redoxome, the universe
of oxidatively modified Cys residues and redox-regulated processes. Having recently mapped the C. elegans
redoxome at unprecedented coverage, we will thereby elucidate the redox effects of the DRRER and SKN-1
isoforms. This effort will reveal a new dimension of stress response effects, identify mechanisms subject to
redox regulation, and uncover processes through which reactive oxygen species can unexpectedly increase
lifespan. These approaches will be informative for understanding how stress resistance or lifespan can be
increased by any intervention. We will thereby also investigate effects of inhibiting the master growth regulator
mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin). C. elegans provides an unparalleled system for unbiased genetic
investigation of stress defense mechanisms, an approach we will continue during the next five years by
focusing on how proteasomal stress regulates SKN-1A. These efforts will yield new paradigms of biological
regulation and significantly deepen our understanding of how cells and organisms defend against stress."

10908405,"Establishment of an aqueous environment as a novel mechanism of bacterial pathogenesis
PI: HE, Sheng Yang; Michigan State University
Project summary
Many bacterial pathogens of plants and mammals, including humans, use the highly conserved type III secretion system
(T3SS) to inject “effector proteins” into the host cell as an important paradigm of pathogenesis. The long-term goal of this
project is to characterize a newly discovered T3SS-mediated virulence strategy by which bacterial pathogens create an
aqueous extracellular environment in host tissues. In nature, many host-pathogen and host-microbiome interactions occur
in air-exposed/connected host organs/tissues (e.g., epidermis/skin and gas-exchange organs including respiratory systems
and plant leaves) in which water availability is limited and/or variable. Because microbes generally require a
moist/aqueous/mucous environment to survive and proliferate, it is not well understood whether microbes actively establish
an infection-conducive aqueous environment in host organs. In humans, malfunction of aquaporins has been associated with
infectious diseases, kidney malfunction and even cancer development and there is an emerging link between aquaporin-
mediated water transport and pathogenesis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. However, cause-effect relationships often
remain unclear. In the past 25 years, the Principal Investigator’s lab has used the model Arabidopsis thaliana – Pseudomonas
syringae interaction to discover and characterize T3SS-mediated bacterial infection mechanisms. By taking advantage of
the genetic tractability of Arabidopsis and a well-characterized T3SS effector repertoire in P. syringae, the PI’s lab recently
discovered a critical role of an aqueous environment in bacterial pathogenesis. In this application, three specific aims are
proposed to test the central hypothesis that, by altering (i) ARF-GEFMIN7-dependent vesicular traffic and (ii) phosphorylation
of aquaporins involved in regulating water transport across host plasma membrane, P. syringae disrupts water homeostasis
across the host plasma membrane, resulting in an aqueous extracellular environment as an important mechanism of
pathogenesis. Aim 1 will determine the role of ARF-GEFMIN7-associated host proteins in regulating vesicular traffic of
aquaporins and extracellular water. Aim 2 will investigate how P. syringae T3SS effector proteins target ARF-GEFMIN7-
associated vesicle traffic and aquaporins to induce an aqueous extracellular environment. Aim 3 will elucidate how
activation of host immunity prevents the virulence actions of P. syringae T3SS effectors as a novel dimension of the host
innate immune response. Contemporary methods in molecular genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and microbial
pathogenesis will be used in this study. Successful completion of this research will significantly advance our understanding
of a newly discovered bacterial virulence mechanism and its interplay with host innate immunity. As many host-microbe
interactions occurs in air-connected host organs/tissues, in which water availability is restricted, it is hoped that this original
research will stimulate studies to broadly examine water regulation in other host-pathogen interactions, and, in the long-
term, facilitate the development of innovative and broadly applicable measures for controlling infectious diseases in diverse
eukaryotic hosts, including plants, animals and humans."
10909033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) is characterized by movement deficits, particularly upper extremity
(UE) impairments on one side of the body. Although strides have been made to improve UE rehabilitation
approaches, even the best available therapies fail to fully ameliorate UE impairments, are costly, and require
large amounts of time. Thus, there is an urgent need to optimize the effectiveness and cost of UE therapies.
Our long-term goal is to develop evidence-based strategies to improve movement in children with USCP.
 Early damage to the developing brain can result in a re-wiring of the direct corticospinal tract (CST)
projections innervating UE function. In many children with USCP, there are no CST connections from the
damaged hemisphere, and instead ipsilateral (same-sided) CST pathways control movement of the affected
UE. Previously, this type of reorganization was believed to be maladaptive and unresponsive to treatment.
However, during the first funding period of this R01, we determined that UE therapy efficacy is independent of
CST laterality. Importantly, we found that the hemisphere containing CST connectivity to the affected hand
showed neuroplastic changes in response to intensive therapy. Nonetheless, this heterogeneity in the brain
connectivity means it is unlikely that a one-size-fits-all rehabilitation approach will be suitable. Therefore, our
next goal is to leverage these findings using an individualized approach to obtain the same or greater changes
using a fraction of the dosage by enhancing the neuroplastic changes with transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS). Our preliminary results show that tDCS enhances the efficacy of UE training only if it is
targeted to an individual’s CST laterality determined with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).
The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically extend what has been learned under our prior R01 by
determining how to optimally target tDCS to enhance the efficacy of UE training in children with USCP. Our
central hypothesis is that bimanual training (BT) combined with a tDCS montage targeting the hemisphere with
CST connectivity to the impaired UE muscles will improve UE function more than BT plus sham stimulation.
We will test this by conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy of targeted
tDCS/BT for improving UE function and interactions between tDCS/BT and motor cortex physiology in
children with USCP. Our working hypotheses are that children who receive targeted anodal tDCS will show
the most robust changes in hand function and motor cortex physiology. Determination of the synergistic effects
of tDCS and BT may substantially reduce the required rehabilitation time and cost necessary to improve UE
function. The proposed work is innovative because it may increase accessibility of treatment, particularly for
centers that serve families of lower socio-economic status, due to the reduced cost of therapy."

Research Project Long-Term Objectives: The project will characterize phenotypic & brain factors related to
co-occurring depression & anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder [ASD] without intellectual disability,
with a focus on understudied populations at elevated risk for these conditions: females [ASDf] and gender diverse
[ASDgd] individuals. Results will inform biomarker identification for comorbid depression & anxiety in ASD.
Overall research design: 3 samples of ASD young adults (aged 18-30y) will be examined. All samples share
phenotyping measures; two samples have a common magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] protocol: i) purposively
sampled ASDf, ASDgd & ASD males will undergo phenotyping & MRI; ii) ASDf- & ASDgd-enriched sample will
undergo phenotyping; iii) existing phenotyping & MRI dataset from a study that oversampled ASDf. Aim 1:
Delineate impacts of emotion identification/awareness (alexithymia) & emotion regulation [ER] on depression &
anxiety, and roles of sex & a continuous measure of gender identity in these impacts. Methods: multi-level
modeling of depressive & anxious symptoms collected via ecological momentary assessment [EMA] will examine
alexithymia as a cognitive factor in depression & anxiety, and its association with ER. Aim 2: Delineate brain
networks associated with alexithymia & its impacts on depression/anxiety/ER. Methods: regression modeling will
relate structural & functional MRI brain connectivity metrics to alexithymia, ER & depression & anxiety.
Health Relatedness: ASD adults experience depression & anxiety at elevated rates. Associated with these
conditions, ASD adults show alarmingly elevated levels of suicidality. There is no good understanding of why
this is, and there is relatively little research on mechanisms—including cognitive and neural factors—that
predispose ASD adults to these serious mental health conditions.
Candidate’s Career Goals & Development Plan: Dr. McQuaid’s long-term goal is to become an independent
investigator with a research program focused on ASD in adulthood and factors relevant to improving mental
health in this population. Her short-term goals are to characterize brain & behavioral/cognitive factors that predict
increased vulnerability for depression & anxiety among ASDf & ASDgd adults. Building on her multidisciplinary
background, Dr. McQuaid will receive training in 1) ASD presentations, gender diversity, & phenomenology &
measurement of mood/anxiety in ASD; 2) EMA & computing skills; 3) professional development & open science.
Environment: Dr. McQuaid is supported by a cohesive team of expert scientists with overlapping &
complementary research programs. They will provide an intensive, focused, & seamless mentorship experience,
and their respective expertise & institutional affiliations will provide Dr. McQuaid with the requisite guidance &
resources to achieve the research aims & training goals. Taken together, the research & training, mentor team,
& environment afforded by the K01 will serve as a bridge that will successfully transition Dr. McQuaid from her
current position to that of a fully independent investigator."
10909037,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY
The 60 million rural dwellers across the United States are older, more likely to live in poverty, and more likely to
be either underinsured or uninsured compared to their urban counterparts. Moreover, the 240,000 rural
patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) have less access to nephrology care, are less likely to finish
pre-kidney transplant evaluation, and are less likely to undergo kidney transplantation.
Telehealth is uniquely positioned to overcome geographic barriers of rural America by capitalizing on electronic
information and telecommunication technologies. Yet telehealth is underutilized among rural patients in
general, and little is known about how geography, resources, and distance to healthcare facilities contribute to
access to care, outcomes, and quality of life for rural patients with ESKD. A comprehensive study of utilization,
cost-effectiveness, and patient and provider preferences would be an important step in expanding telehealth
policies specifically aimed to care for the rural ESKD population.
We propose the following specific aims: (1) to assess the costs, utilization, and outcomes associated with
telehealth for rural patients with ESKD; (2) to compare telehealth provision of ESKD care to standard in-office
care in the rural ESKD population using model-based cost-effectiveness analysis; and (3) to understand
facilitators and barriers of using telehealth from the perspective of patients and providers.
A detailed training plan for Joel T. Adler, MD, MPH, is outlined in this proposal. In brief, it includes in-depth
coursework to extend and expand Dr. Adler’s research skills, a practicum experience with the RURAL (Risk
Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal) Cohort study in the southern rural United States, and a mentorship plan
jointly prepared by the principal investigator and a team with expertise in kidney disease, health services
research, qualitative research, cost-effectiveness analysis, and the mentorship of junior clinician-scientists.
This will help the candidate meet the following career goals: (1) gain state of the art expertise in large claims
database, geographic information systems, cost-effectiveness, and qualitative research, (2) apply for and
obtain R01 grant funding, and (3) transition to academic independence.
When completed, Dr. Adler will have learned the perspectives of rural patients with EKSD and providers on
telehealth that will be methodically crucial in designing pilot studies that inform R01 proposals to increase
accessibility and utilization of telehealth on a population-health level for rural patents with ESKD. These efforts
will culminate in a comprehensive understanding of the role of telehealth in caring for rural patients with ESKD
by economic assessment of its utilization, a cost-effectiveness analysis for implementation on a wider scale,
and learning how these align with patient and provider preferences to inform future policy regarding telehealth
utilization and reimbursement."

Locomotion is a fundamental behavior that allows humans and animals to move through their environments and
is critically involved in all aspects of life. This behavior is impeded in a number of diseases, disorders, and
injuries, including spinal cord injury, stroke, and various ataxias. All of the essential circuity to generate locomotor
rhythm and pattern is located in the thoracolumbar spinal cord, most often below the level of neural damage.
These circuits can be accessed directly via various central and peripheral stimulation methods, including but not
limited to epidural stimulation. Rhythm generating circuits are the entry point for initiation and control of
locomotion, affect all downstream neurons related to locomotion, and, therefore, are the first step in establishing
spinal control of locomotion. Successful activation of the rhythm generator clinically has been hampered because
the mechanisms by which spinal neuronal circuits generate coordinated rhythmic output remain poorly
understood and represents a major gap in our understanding of neural control of movement. The generation of
rhythmic motor behaviors is based on a triad involving: (1) specific “rhythmogenic” properties allowing individual
neurons to generate rhythmic oscillations, (2) mutual excitatory interactions to synchronize neuronal activity into
rhythmic populational bursting, and (3) network inhibition to coordinate activity between different neuronal
populations, which can both shape locomotor pattern and control frequency. Triad components are highly
interconnected and the involvement of each component is condition-dependent. The proposed study will use
highly integrated electrophysiological, pharmacological, genetic, and computational approaches to systematically
explore the specific contributions of these mechanisms and the interactions between them, in the generation and
patterning of the locomotor rhythm. Utilizing spinal neurons identified in transgenic mice by the transcription
factor Shox2 as a representative rhythm generating population, we will test the overarching hypothesis that rhythm
generating mechanisms in the spinal cord involve interplay between the triad of cellular, population, and network
properties, whose contribution to rhythmogenesis is interdependent, leading to flexibility and adaptability seen
as alterations in the relative balance of the triad in different conditions. We will first determine the voltage-gated
currents underlying spontaneous cellular oscillations in adult Shox2 neurons. We will then assess excitatory
interactions between rhythm generating neurons. Lastly, we will establish the role of ipsilateral and contralateral
network interactions in regulating locomotor frequency, and determine the operation of these pathways during
afferent-evoked locomotion. Together, our multidisciplinary study will reveal mechanisms of rhythm generation,
establish the first mammalian locomotor neural network model based on “real” rhythm generating cellular and
network properties, and determine the ways by which afferent stimulation may influence the locomotor rhythm
and pattern generated in the spinal cord. The results of these studies will identify specific neural targets for the
future devices and strategies aimed at restoration of locomotion following injury or motor disorders."

Nausea is an unpleasant sensation of visceral malaise often accompanied by an involuntary urge to vomit.
Nausea responses to toxin ingestion and infection are evolutionarily beneficial survival behaviors that
avoid or expel toxins which may cause peripheral tissue damage. However, the sensation of nausea can
also be maladaptive, as many treatments for cancer, diabetes, and other illnesses induce nausea as a
major side effect, while current anti-emetic drugs have only limited efficacy. Known as the
“chemoreceptors trigger zone” for nausea, the area postrema is a brain circumventricular sensory organ
critical for nausea and vomiting. Neurons in the area postrema occupy a unique anatomical location with
a deficient blood-brain barrier, and can be regulated by inputs from both the humoral routes and the
gastrointestinal tract. However, little is known about how area postrema neurons contribute to the
mechanisms of nausea and its related aversive behaviors. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing
combined with genetic and behavioral studies, we have recently discovered a population of the area
postrema neurons that, in response to emetic cues, induce nausea-associated aversive behaviors in
mice. Here, I propose a multi-tiered approach, based on these preliminary findings, to investigate the
humoral and vagal inputs to the chemosensory circuit of the area postrema and how they contribute to
nausea. First, I will identify humoral cues that act through the area postrema aversion-promoting
excitatory neuron types by testing a panel of nausea-inducing or anorexigenic humoral stimuli (Aim 1).
Next, I will map and identify vagal inputs to the genetically defined area postrema excitatory neuron types
using viral tracing and channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping techniques (Aim 2). These
experiments will reveal how vagal inputs and humoral cues can regulate the functions of the area
postrema neurons which mediate nausea-associated aversive behaviors. Following this training, I will be
poised to transition to the R00 phase of my career and establish a unique independent research program
incorporating targeted cell-type manipulation in vomiting animal models (Aim 3). These studies will
elucidate the cellular and neural mechanisms nausea and may guide the design of novel anti-emetic
therapies. Central to this proposal is the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Liberles, an expert in internal
sensations, Dr. Brad Lowell, an expert in functional circuit mapping, Dr. Frank Reimann, an expert in gut
hormone signaling, Dr. Chenghua Gu, a leader in blood-brain barrier mechanisms, and Dr. Charles Horn,

Dental caries is a persistent public health problem that impacts a large fraction of the US population. Nearly all
adults in the United States are considered at risk of developing tooth decay, and for children it is a common
chronic disease. Though widely and routinely used, there are always concerns about patient exposure to X-rays
during radiographic imaging – a concern especially heightened with children.
Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD) proposes to develop an improved digital X-ray detector for dental
radiography that will retain all the benefits of a current digital technology, while improving sensitivity and
reducing patient dose. The device will involve the integration of two technologies - silicon based imaging arrays
and semiconductor x-ray conversion layers. The silicon capabilities are well understood, with CCD and CMOS
devices well established in dental imaging. The application of a semiconductor conversion layer is the more
innovative and challenging aspect of the concept.
RMD's innovation is to replace the commonly used CsI or amorphous selenium X-ray receptors with the
semiconductor thallium bromide (TlBr). TlBr will provide a much greater dose efficiency and higher image
contrast. The advantage to dental imaging is that dentists will get the high resolution images that they are
accustomed to, but now with a much lower dose to the patient.
During Phase I, RMD will develop the processes to fabricate high quality films of TlBr and compare the
technology to existing detector films to demonstrate the superiority of TlBr. The work plan will encompass film
deposition, investigation of compatible electrode layers to work in conjunction with the TlBr, identification and
mitigation strategies of technical challenges that arise, and completion of a wide range of electrical and physical
tests to gauge X-ray sensitivity and image quality. In Phase II RMD will optimize the processes, fabricate X-ray
imaging detectors on KA Imaging CMOS ROICs and fully characterize a complete detector system. The result of
this research will be a new digital radiography detector with comparable or better image quality and significantly
lower patient dose than currently used detectors."

With recent advances in structural biology and supercomputing technology, all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation technique has gained momentum as a prominent tool for the study of protein structural
dynamics. Brute-force MD, however, is not capable of adequately sampling most functionally relevant
biomolecular processes such as large-scale protein conformational changes. Various approaches have been
developed over the last three decades to address the “timescale gap” that hinders the use of MD in real-
world applications. Free energy calculation methods, enhanced sampling techniques, and path-finding
algorithms are examples of umbrella terms that describe many of these methods. This project specifically
aims at employing, tailoring, and fine-tuning state-of-the-art enhanced sampling and path-finding
algorithms to address important biological and biomedical questions. The overall aim of this project is to
develop and employ robust and practical sampling and analysis protocols to study functionally relevant
conformational changes of various proteins from fibroblast growth factor to coronavirus spike protein. Our
proposed methodological framework specifically takes advantage of (1) robust theoretical formalisms
rooted in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and differential geometry; (2) system-specific enhanced
sampling protocols that are tunable for the specific problem at hand; and (3) and integrative and synergistic
approach to experimental (specifically smFRET) and computational (specifically MD) techniques. Some
of the systems proposed to be studied here include proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters, influenza
hemagglutinin, ATP-binding transporters, coronavirus spike proteins, mechanosensitive channel of large
conductance, membrane insertase YidC, serotonin transporter, and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) protein.
The common theme in all of these projects is the large-scale conformational changes involved in the
function of these proteins. The successful use of the methodology proposed in this project will allow the
characterization of these conformational changes at the molecular level and pave the groundwork for the
routine application of state-of-the-art enhanced sampling techniques in the study of real world biological
problems."

Sepsis is a syndrome characterizied by a dysregulated host immune response to an infection that leads to
organ dysfunction. Because sepsis is among the leading causes of death among hospitalized patients and
accounts for substantial harms, costs, and loss of quality of life, many efforts have been made to improve
sepsis care. The mainstay of treatment is timely recognition and prompt initiation of broad-spectrum an-
timicrobial therapy. However, identification of sepsis is fraught with uncertainty in busy and complex clinical
environments and treatment delays are common in the emergency department, hospital ward, and intensive
care unit. As a result, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to provide
timely clinical decision support (CDS) has good face validity to improve care. Despite hundreds of published
papers on predictive sepsis systems, there is very little evidence that such systems actually improve care
processes or patient outcomes. Therefore, this proposal outlines three important knowledge gaps at the in-
tersection of AI/ML methods and clinical care that have so far hindered the development of successful sepsis
CDS systems. First, the optimal outcome (i.e., training label) on which to develop predictive systems for sep-
sis is unknown. Current sepsis definitions were designed primarily to standardize clinical trial enrollment and
epidemiologic surveillance rather than to support bedside treatment decisions. Second, although sepsis is
currently defined by changes in organ function from baseline, the optimal approach to capture time-varying
changes in clinical parameters remains unknown. Many AI/ML methods are uniquely suited to learning such
important patterns in the data but their use in predicting sepsis remains under-explored. Third, there are
significant differences in patient outcomes and clinical presentation between community- and hospital-onset
sepsis. However, how these differences might affect predictive accuracy, estimates of variable importance,
timing and use of predictive alerts, among other important considerations for CDS development, remains un-
known. Thus, this proposal seeks to answer these fundamental questions to overcome key knowledge gaps
and realize the promise of AI/ML methods for improving sepsis care. Broadly speaking, we will consider sev-
eral state-of-the-art approaches to answer these questions, including the use of i) informatics methods such
as active learning to facilitate efficient and large-scale clinician review of patient data, ii) advanced causal
inference methods such as target trial emulation to compare the clinical effects of treatment according to
different sepsis definitions, and iii) AI/ML methods such as convolutional neural networks and denoising
autoencoders to determine the optimal representations of complex and time-varying clinical features. An-
swering these questions will pave the way for the development of AI/ML CDS systems that are relevant at
the bedside, scalable across a diverse range of care contexts and patient populations, and most importantly
that improve clinical care and patient outcomes."

Tremendous growth in the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is expected, with
estimates indicating that by 2050 two-thirds of adults with ADRD will reside in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). There is an urgent need to identify individuals at highest risk for ADRD at its earliest stages in order to
better target prevention and early intervention strategies. While mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is intended to
identify cognitively symptomatic individuals who are at greatest risk of progressing to dementia, most knowledge
regarding the measurement of MCI, its risk factors, and its prognosis comes from high-income countries. In
addition, MCI demonstrates significant variability in its course, given that large numbers of individuals with MCI
either revert to cognitively normal or remain with a stable MCI diagnosis over time. Differences in life-course
environmental determinants of cognitive health, biological risk, representativeness of study populations, MCI
criteria, and cognitive measurement methods may contribute to this variability. Moreover, little is known from a
global perspective about MCI measurement, its risk factors, and prognosis, particularly among LMICs which are
expected to carry the greatest future ADRD burden. The overall goal of this study is to improve the cross-national
measurement of MCI and to characterize its longitudinal course across populations with varied social, economic,
cultural, and healthcare life experiences. Data from the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP)
Network offers a unique opportunity to generate harmonized MCI and dementia diagnoses and to investigate
the course and predictors of MCI cross-nationally. We will use data from 3 studies with longitudinal HCAP data:
the Health and Retirement (HRS) HCAP in the US; the Mexican Health and Aging Study’s (MHAS) ancillary
study on cognitive aging (Mex-Cog); and the Longitudinal Aging Study in India–Diagnostic Assessment of
Dementia (LASI-DAD). In Aim 1, we will harmonize MCI and dementia classifications cross-nationally and will
compare the longitudinal prognosis of MCI across the US, Mexico, and India. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
unique and shared sociodemographic, lifestyle, health, and biological risk factors associated with incident MCI
and dementia across the US, Mexico, and India. In Aim 3, we will study the unique and shared cognitive and
functional predictors of incident MCI and dementia risk cross-nationally and explore whether these predictors
are consistent across levels of educational attainment, sex/gender, and literacy. This proposal will enhance the
field of ADRD globally by improving the measurement of MCI and identifying the sociocultural and biological
pathways to ADRD from MCI to aid in the early identification of individuals at most risk of dementia, for whom
interventions should be prioritized."

An individual’s phenotypes related to their health conditions are associated with the complex interplay between
the individual’s biological, behavioral, social, and environmental processes, including phenomena that occur both
within (e.g., genetics, emotion, cognition) and external (e.g., social, built, and natural environments) to the
organism. Behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the
systematic study of behavioral and social phenomena relevant to health—is key to understanding how these
internal and external processes interact to alter health, and for developing efficacious interventions.
Nevertheless, BSSR of health face substantial challenges in part due to its broad and complex research
landscape, but also because of the “inconsistent use of terms and classification systems making it challenging
to integrate findings from individual studies and in turn to cumulatively build bodies of knowledge even in domains
that are consistently studied.” Ontologies provide a way to address these challenges in BSSR. Recognized and
sponsored by the NIH and various other agencies and professional societies, the National Academies of
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) formed a multidisciplinary committee to study ways to improve
the development and use of ontologies in the BSSR domains and produced a comprehensive consensus report
identified barriers, opportunities, and recommended approaches to advancing BSSR ontologies important to
health. Motivated by the Report, the NIH aims to create a BSSR ontology development network with research
projects (PAR-23-182) covering a wide range of disciplines related to BSSR across multiple NIH
Institutes/Centers, with a Dissemination and Coordination Center (DCC; PAR-23-181) to (1) facilitate
collaboration and cross-project learning; (2) provide ontology-related technical, computational, and informatics
expertise and support; (3) facilitate dissemination of resources and training to support ontology expansion,
development, and use; and (4) provide active outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders to increase
understanding of and demand for BSSR ontology-related tools and resources. In response to PAR-23-181, we
established a multidisciplinary team with the necessary subject matter expertise to carry out the functionalities
of the DCC, leveraging existing ontology resources and tools (e.g., Protégé) that we have developed, and the
long-standing ontology community (e.g., BiPortal) we have built and sustained. Our Specific Aims are to (1)
provide administrative and logistical support for the U01 Research Network; (2) develop a common technical
framework with standard operating procedures (SOPs) to guide the development of BSSR ontologies in the U01
Research Network; and (3) develop a “toolbox” of resources through which the products of the Network can be
shared with, and adopted for use, by all the relevant communities."

Some of the most interesting and important aspects of behavior and brain function arise from social interactions.
The dynamics of dyads or larger groups of animals can be critical for survival, such as development of territories
and foraging patterns, building of housing structures such as nests or burrows, and co-parenting to ensure that
at least one experienced caretaker is attending to the needs of offspring. Methodological advances in the last
five years now enable studies of the neural circuits for social and parental behavior in complex environments in
ways not formerly feasible or even possible. Specifically, technical developments in wireless recording,
optogenetics for measuring and manipulating certain cell types, algorithms for neural data analysis, methods for
quantifying multi-animal behavioral interactions, and the capacity to store and share large data sets have each
enabled fundamental discoveries and conceptual breakthroughs relating brain activity to quantitative behavior.
 In this proposal, we take advantage of each of these advances with an integrated approach to examine
social and parental behavior in mice in the lab as well as outdoors. This application is a collaborative effort
between the Graham lab at Princeton and the Froemke lab at NYU. For the last several years we have been
collaborating, ‘rewilding’ lab mice by placing them outdoors for several weeks at the Stony Ford field station near
the Princeton campus. Rewilded mice express many interesting behaviors that we have developed approaches
for monitoring and tracking, with multimodal imaging and analysis of behavioral and physiological variables. We
believe it is now the time to study these interesting behaviors and interactions, in complex social and spatial
environments in conjunction with neural recordings. The central hypothesis is that neurons of the central oxytocin
system track the identity and behavior of other animals in a social network, promoting pro-social behaviors to
minimize environmental stressors (hunger, hypo- or hyperthermia, crying infants). We will use quantitative
behavioral methods based on RFID tracking, video and thermal imaging, combined with neural recordings from
hypothalamic neurons including oxytocin neurons. In Aim 1 we examine adult social interactions in same-sex
groups of females or males, and in Aim 2 we examine collective parenting by groups of females. Our overall goal
is to determine what features of group dynamics emerge in a complex outdoor ecosystem, and how the oxytocin
system might enable successful navigation of this socio-spatial environment. These studies will provide direct
data towards the central aims of the BRAIN Initiative: quantitative behavioral analysis of interesting multi-animal
behaviors in complex environments coupled to neural data collection, to understand essential brain functions
related to group survival."
10940756,"Neuronal activity is critical for brain development and altered activity-dependent plasticity is found
in neurodevelopment disorders. RNA binding protein FMRP, encoded by the X-linked Fragile X
Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1) gene, has been shown to regulate activity-dependent
neuronal function and plasticity. FMRP loss of function leads to fragile X Syndrome (FXS) 7-9, the
most common heritable cause of intellectual disability and a top contributor to autism spectrum
disorders (ASD). Despite extensive interest, the mechanisms underlying FXS and FMRP
regulation, especially in humans, are not fully clear. Neurons have high energy demand and both
mitochondrial content and oxidative phosphorylation increase during neuronal maturation and
activation. We published the first paper to show that FMRP deficiency in mouse neurons leads to
mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired mitochondrial function. To translate these exciting
findings into humans, we assessed human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs)-differentiated neurons
and discovered that FMRP-deficient human neurons have not only mitochondrial fragmentation
but also reduced amount of mitochondria. In addition to MFNs, human FXS neurons also have
reduced PGC1α (PPARGC1A), a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy
metabolism. We and others have shown that human FXS neurons exhibit hyperexcitability in the
absence of stimulation. Our preliminary study found that human FXS neurons had reduced
response to neuronal activation stimulus. Using CLIP-seq we have identified RACK1 (Receptor
for Activated C Kinase 1) as a direct target of FMRP in human but not mouse neurons. RACK1-
defieicent human neurons phenocopy mitochondrial deficits and hyperexcitability of human FXS
neurons and exogenous RACK1 rescues deficits of human FXS neurons. RACK1 is essential for
both human and mouse development; however, the role of RACK1 human neuron development
is unknown. We hypothesize that FMRP is required for neuronal activity-dependent mitochondrial
biogenesis and energy metabolism during human neuron development and RACK1 is a key
mediator of such regulation. We will investigate the impact of FMRP and RACK1 deficiency on
activity-dependent mitochondrial dynamics and functions in human neurons; determine the
mechanisms underlying RACK1 regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and energy metabolism in
human neurons, and comprehensively characterize proteome and metabolome of FXS human
neurons. The proposed work will fill a major gap of our knowledge in understanding metabolic
regulation in human neuron development, which is critical for therapeutic development for FXS,
ASD, and other brain disorders."

Gaucher disease (GD) is a common lysosomal storage disease, occurring at a rate of 1 in 500 in Ashkenazi
Jews and 1/60,000 in the general population. Defective acid β-glucosidase (GCase) in GD results in progressive
accumulation of glycolipid substrates in tissues leading to hepatosplenomegaly, weakened bone, impaired blood
clotting and neurological impairments. Despite many advances in GD therapy, treatments are only partially
effective for the more common visceral forms and are completely inadequate for a highly symptomatic and
frequently lethal subtype of the disease, neuronopathic GD (nGD), affecting the central nervous system (CNS).
Current enzyme replacement treatments (ERT) for nGD are limited by two major challenges: limited penetration
of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and instability of GCase of existing ERT resulting in short half-lives in circulations
and organs. We have developed a novel Saposin C (SapC)-dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) nanocarrier that
can penetrate the BBB. When SapC-DOPS is combined with a novel stable enzyme, named fGCase, allows for
efficient transport into the brain with sustained bioactivity. Our intravenously delivered, long-acting SapC-DOPS-
fGCase retains kinetic stability in mouse plasma and cells, penetrates through the BBB into the CNS, and
displays prolonged activity leading to reduction of brain-accumulated glycolipid substrates. Preliminary results
suggest that interplay between SapC, phosphatidyl serine (PS), a receptor for SapC, and the lymphatic system
influences SapC-DOPS’s ability to transport the enzyme across the BBB and process in the brain. These
preliminary findings strongly suggest that the highly brain-stable SapC-DOPS-fGCase will maintain adequate
and sustainable activities to restore GCase function in GD brains. Based on these promising features of SapC-
DOPS and fGCase, our overall hypothesis is that SapC-DOPS-fGCase will reestablish GCase function in GD
brains and improve brain disease outcomes to advance enzyme treatment for nGD. In Aim 1, we will 1) determine
the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of SapC-DOPS-fGCase, 2) evaluate the therapeutic impact in nGD
mouse models and human nGD iPSC-derived midbrain-like organoid model, and 3) investigate the underlying
mechanism(s) of this novel CNS-ERT approach in protecting neuronal cell functions. In Aim 2, we will define the
pathways involved in the transport of SapC-DOPS-fGCase across the BBB. Our focus will be to investigate the
interplay of cell surface PS and SapC-DOPS and the role of CNS-lymphatics for SapC-DOPS-fGCase
processing in the brain. Completing this preclinical study will provide proof of concept for SapC-DOPS-fGCase
to be a transformative ERT for human nGD. Additionally, we will gain a deeper understanding of PS-dependent,
CNS-targeting of SapC-DOPS through the CNS-lymphatic system."

with either MD, PharmD, and/or PhD degrees) with substantial potential to become successful and 
transformative biomedical researchers at the Georgia CTSA partner institutions (Emory University, Morehouse 
School of Medicine, Georgia Institute of Technology [Georgia Tech], and the University of Georgia). A solid
foundation has been established for the KL2 Core over the past 14 years. Our KL2 program has supported 60
scholars (including 26 during the current cycle of funding); 70% have been women (Georgia CTSA is in the top 
3 hubs nationally in the proportion of women KL2 scholars) and 27% are underrepresented minorities. Among 
the 46 scholars who have completed training, 43 (93%) remain in careers engaged in CTR; 70% of our former

Biliary atresia (BA) is an inflammatory, sclerosing lesion of the biliary tree that presents in infancy and is
associated with significant biliary fibrosis. The degree of fibrosis at presentation is unprecedented compared to
any other organ-specific disease of infancy and the vast majority of BA patients will need liver transplantation
for survival. Various immune pathways have been implicated in cholangiocyte injury in BA, yet key immune
pathways that promote fibrosis are unknown. A critical barrier to discovering novel therapies in BA is the lack of
an understanding of key cellular mechanisms promoting biliary fibrosis. The biomarker CXCL8 (IL-8), a
neutrophil chemoattractant and activator, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been previously
shown to predict worse outcomes in BA. Significant preliminary data within this proposal reveals that
neutrophils are chronically activated in BA patients, with persistent CXCL8-CXCR2-mediated NET formation
(NETosis). Constituents of BA NETs include pro-fibrogenic proteins and NETs positively correlate with
biomarkers of injury and fibrosis. The hypothesis to be tested is that the immunopathogenesis of BA involves
CXCL8-CXCR2-mediated NETosis, resulting in NET-induced portal fibroblast and stellate cell activation. The
rotavirus-induced mouse model of BA (murine BA), as well as analyses of human biospecimens, will be
employed to address the hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will determine if neutrophil CXCR2 activation is essential
for NETosis in murine BA. Specific Aim 2 will determine the predominant source of reactive oxygen species
that is necessary for NETosis (NADPH-oxidase dependent versus mitochondrial source). Specific Aim 3 will
establish the pro-fibrogenic role of NETs in BA, including portal fibroblast and hepatic stellate cell activation
through use of primary cell lines and hepatic organoids. Impact. Discoveries from this research could be highly
impactful, with increased knowledge gained in neutrophil biology and with the identification of novel
therapeutics targeting NETosis that would prevent biliary cirrhosis in children with BA."

Development Program since 1999. Our group was one of 12 academic centers to be selected as 
an ETCTN Lead Academic Organization (LAO) for the phase 1 component, and subsequently 
selected as one of 10 academic centers to integrate phase 2 clinical trial efforts, with responsibility 
for developing, leading, and accruing to ETCTN clinical trials for adult cancer patients. We now 
propose to be a member of the NCI ETCTN as the Pittsburgh Cancer Consortium (PCC) Lead 
Academic Organization in a consortium with the University of Florida Health Cancer Center and 
the Albert Einstein Cancer Center. The goal of the PCC is to create a unified, integrated clinical 
trials network that will allow for more seamless advancement and progress of novel experimental 
agents and/or combinations through early stages of drug development. The eventual goal of our 
program is to greatly facilitate and accelerate the delivery of new cancer therapies to the citizens 
of Pennsylvania, North-Central Florida, Bronx, NY, and their respective catchment areas."
10938706,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Family formation plans (e.g., whether/when to have children) vary by micro-level factors like
sociodemographics (age, race/ethnicity) and individual- and couple-level influences like finances and job
security. These micro-level influences do not fully account for variations in reproductive life plans, which are
also influenced by macro-level factors like state and local laws and structural inequities. Sexual and gender
minority (SGM) people's health and wellbeing may be particularly affected by these macro-level factors. Our
research and that of others demonstrate that structural stigma (macro-social conditions like anti-LGBT
legislation that negatively impact wellbeing) worsens SGM people's mental and physical health. Given current
high levels of structural stigma in the US, there is an urgent need to understand the potential health and
wellbeing impacts to halt the widening of already gaping health disparities. One aspect of health and wellbeing
potentially impacted by anti-LGBT legislation and other forms of structural stigma is having children. Almost
40% of SGM people are interested in parenting but may face unique barriers in doing so. Being unable to
freely plan when, whether, and how to have children excludes SGM people from a health-promoting life stage,
which may drive some SGM-related health disparities (e.g., alcohol use, cardiovascular health, depression).
The proposed mixed-methods study will prospectively examine multi-level impacts on SGM couples' family
formation plans. Aim 1. Quantitatively test multi-level influences on family formation plans through a large-scale
survey of SGM couples. We hypothesize that couples living in states with higher levels of structural stigma will
be less likely to plan to have children and more likely to report that state-level policies influence their decision-
making. These associations will be moderated by the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the couple, as
well as by SES. Aim 2. Qualitatively describe multi-level factors influencing SGM couples' family formation
planning. From the Aim 1 sample, we will recruit couples from states with high and low structural stigma for in-
depth dyadic interviews (N=120). We will describe multi-level influences on family formation planning. Aim 3.
Given the dynamic sociopolitical landscape for marginalized populations, we will quantify changes in impacts of
multi-level factors on family formation plans and well-being over time. We will follow the Aim 2 subsample with
dyadic pulse surveys (i.e., brief/regular surveys across three years) and a final in-depth dyadic interview. Using
qualitative trajectory methods and prospective analyses of dyadic pulse surveys, we will test our hypotheses
that changes (or lack thereof) in couples' contexts (e.g., moving to another state, legislation changes) will
influence decision-making, mental health, relationship quality, and family formation. This project will produce
the first investigation of how multi-level factors prospectively influence SGM couples' family formation plans.
This work will have a positive impact by revealing for the first time the multi-level needs of LGBTQ couples as
they form families, thereby informing interventions to reduce entrenched inequities."

Hypospadias, a urethral opening on the underside of the penis, is one of the most common birth defects in
boys (1 in 250 newborns). Left untreated, hypospadias may affect quality of life, cosmetic appearance,
urination, sexual function, and fertility. Currently, parents must make this important, preference-sensitive
treatment decision with neither evidence-based guidance nor a clearly superior option. Consequently, 55-71%
of parents experience decisional regret regardless of whether they choose surgery which is strongly associated
with decisional conflict. We aim to reduce parental decisional conflict and regret by improving information
delivery through use of a shared decision-making (SDM) tool called the Hypospadias Hub. It was developed
and pilot-tested at two U.S. sites by our team. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation study of the Hypospadias Hub Intervention. Our two-arm randomized controlled
trial will assess its effectiveness to: 1) improve quality of SDM during hypospadias consultations as measured
by parent report (primary outcome), and observer report (secondary outcome), 2) decrease decisional conflict
and regret, and increase decision-relevant hypospadias knowledge (secondary outcomes). We will also assess
barriers and facilitators to its future implementation. Our aims are 1. Compare the effect of the Hypospadias
Hub Intervention vs. control on the quality of SDM (primary outcome). We will assess how providers
influence parents’ choices using qualitative content analysis of transcripts of the consultations. Parents will be
randomized to the respective arms of the study. Hypothesis: The quality of SDM during the consultation will be
higher in the intervention than the control group. 2. Compare the effect of the Hypospadias Hub
Intervention vs. control on decisional conflict, decision-relevant knowledge, and decisional regret
(secondary outcomes). Hypothesis: Decisional conflict and regret will be lower, and knowledge higher in the
intervention vs. control group. 3. Assess barriers and facilitators to future implementation using
constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We will use qualitative
interviews with a diverse sample of parents, providers, nurses, and clinic staff to explore recommendations for
implementation, and potential future implementation strategies. Evidence of the effectiveness of the
Hypospadias Hub Intervention to improve quality of SDM and decision quality for parents making decisions
about hypospadias, combined with insights gained from our implementation assessment, will support wider
adoption, and inform development of tools for other preference-sensitive decisions, which will improve child
health and quality of life."
10939186,"Project Summary
Cystinuria is a rare disease characterized by chronic, recurrent lithiasis (stone formation) in the urinary tract due
to accumulation of high concentrations of cystine in the urine. This accumulation results from impaired
reabsorption of the amino acid cysteine and its poorly-soluble, oxidized form, cystine, from the kidney back into
systemic circulation. Current therapeutic strategies involve lowering the effective cystine concentration or
increasing its solubility in the urine, but patient compliance is low due to treatment burden and unfavorable side
effect profiles. Chronic kidney disease is common and surgical intervention is a necessary and recurrent event
in the lives of these patients. For these reasons, the disease burden due to cystinuria represents an unmet
clinical need. In short, both the disease and its narrow range of treatment options exact a heavy toll on cystinuria
patients, resulting in greatly diminished quality-of-life. Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide safe,
effective therapies that not only prevent or slow the growth of cystine kidney stones, but also carry a low
treatment burden and thus promote adherence to therapy.
Human enzyme therapy represents an attractive, tractable means of combatting metabolic disorders that
manifest as metabolite imbalances in the systemic circulation or in tissue compartments that are addressable
through manipulation of the systemic circulation. In principle, cystinuria fits this treatment modality, as cysteine
and cystine (cyst(e)ine) derived from the blood are filtered into the urine where they concentrate due to defective
reabsorption mechanisms, leading to lithiasis. Lowering circulating levels of cyst(e)ine to concentrations that
will normalize urine metabolite levels but not affect cyst(e)ine homeostasis should prevent or reduce the rate of
stone formation, even in the context of impaired reabsorption of these amino acids. Therapeutic enzyme-
mediated normalization of amino acid levels has been clinically validated for other diseases.
This project seeks to determine if a human enzyme therapeutic that degrades cyst(e)ine can prevent or slow
lithiasis and mitigate associated kidney pathology in the Slc3a1 knockout mouse model, a translationally-relevant
model of human cystinuria. Changes in stone volume and multiplicity will be assessed by computed tomography
and values will be compared to controls and baseline values as appropriate. Importantly, the long-term safety
of this approach will also be evaluated by chronically dosing human cyst(e)inase in mice and undertaking a
rigorous health assessment of treated animals, including body weight and behavioral measurements, blood-
based measures of physiological function, and metabolomics."

Sanfilippo Syndrome type B.
Project Summary
The AAVtcm8-coNAGLU vector is able to correct the Sanfilippo Syndrome type B mouse model
to normal lysosomal storage, hearing and lifespan when injected either into the brain or into the
cisterna magna at 1.5E+11 vg/gram of brain. Additional studies in mice, dogs, and non-human
primates (NHP) indicate broad brain distribution and NAGLU expression at the same dose in
vg/g of brain weight by cisternal delivery. This project will perform the development of the
AAVtcm8-coNAGLU product to the stage of Investigational New Drug approval. Potency assays
and neutralizing antibody assays will be developed. Minimal and optimal effective dose
assessment studies will be performed along with assessment of immune response to the capsid
and NAGLU protein. Optimization of production to ensure purity and reduce empty capsids will
be performed and reproducibility of the process will be assessed for purity, potency, and
stability. Toxicology studies will be performed with the optimized product in mice and non-
human primates at half dose, target dose and 3-fold target dose to establish distribution of
vector, enzyme, and tissue toxicity. Pre-IND regulatory profiles will be submitted to and
approved by the FDA. GMP production will be performed with the optimized production methods
and assessments. Toxicology and distribution assays will be re-performed with mice and NHP
using Good Laboratory Practice to enable IND. Assays of clinical endpoints of serum and
cerebrospinal fluid NAGLU activity and heparan sulfate level will be validated. The clinical study
parameters will be determined and approved, and the IND will be submitted for FDA approval."

Depression is a heterogenous and widespread disorder (lifetime prevalence >20%) and confers a substantial
societal burden. Current pharmacological therapies are effective for many patients; however, more than 30%
fail to achieve remission, and even responders exhibit significant residual symptoms including anhedonia.
One pathophysiologic pathway shown to contribute to symptoms of depression is inflammation. Elevated
inflammatory markers are observed in both the periphery and central nervous system in a significant proportion
of patients with depression, particularly in patients that are resistant to conventional antidepressant therapies.
Basic and clinical findings indicate that inflammation can affect striatal dopamine availability and release to
contribute to symptoms of anhedonia and reduced motivation. We previously reported a relationship between
inflammation and functional connectivity (FC) in dopaminergic reward circuitry in patients with major
depressive disorder (MDD) whereby patients with higher plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations
exhibited lower FC between the ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which was
correlated with symptoms of anhedonia. Preliminary data from our current study demonstrate that VS-vmPFC
FC connectivity was increased after acute administration of the dopamine precursor, levodopa (L-DOPA),
compared to placebo in patients with high CRP (indexed as CRP >2 mg/L). Clinical and translational evidence
from our group and others suggests that inflammation may impact corticostriatal circuits by decreasing the
availability and release of dopamine, indicating that increasing dopamine with L-DOPA can reverse the impact
of inflammation on this circuit.
in MDD patients with high infla
We hypothesize that treatment with L-DOPA will improve depressive symptoms
mmation and anhedonia by increasing FC in reward circuitry and improving
motivation. To determine a dosing strategy for L-DOPA that affects VS-vmPFC FC and behavior in the R61
Phase, medically-stable and medication-free adults with MDD, plasma CRP >2 mg/L, and high anhedonia will
receive treatment with three doses of L-DOPA compared to placebo (randomized, double-blind, crossover).
Patients will undergo resting-state and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to probe FC
in reward circuity in relation to bioavailability of L-DOPA at baseline and after 1 week at each dose. Safety and
tolerability and data on the effect of L-DOPA on anhedonia and motivation in relation to target engagement in
the brain (FC) will also be assessed. If L-DOPA increases VS-vmPFC FC at our Go/No-Go threshold, we will
compare the dose of L-DOPA exhibiting optimal target engagement and tolerability to placebo in the R33.
Subjects meeting the above criteria will be randomized to L-DOPA or placebo to determine whether L-DOPA
has potential for clinical impact (Go/No-Go criteria: change in depression severity) and whether response is
influenced by change in FC, anhedonia and/or motivation. Additional baseline behavioral, biological and MRI
measures will be collected for use as possible predictors of response and to enhance interpretation of results."
10915234,"ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) is a nationwide epidemic. Many HF patients are presented with left bundle branch block
(LBBB) morphology and mechanical dyssynchrony, which are strong predictors of cardiovascular mortality. For
patients with prolonged QRS duration >150 ms, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended to
restore normal activation patterns in the heart. About 30% of patients, however, still do not improve after CRT
(non-responders), and the percentage of CRT non-responders has remained relatively constant. To address
the issue of CRT non-responders and improve the treatment of conduction disorders, there are new exciting
developments in pacing therapy (e.g., HIS bundle pacing, left branch bundle (LBB) pacing, LV endocardial
pacing). When ischemia and/or a scar are present, experiments have shown that lead positioning and timing of the
LV stimulation are critical parameters that require precise optimization to achieve positive CRT responses. This is
especially relevant when a large number of CRT recipients (≥50%) in North America and Europe have ischemic
cardiomyopathy (ICM), and the percentage of CRT non-responders is higher in ICM patients than in non-ICM
patients. As such, computational models are powerful tools that can be exploited to optimize CRT response on a
patient-specific basis. In this Phase I grant, we will develop a software tool for the optimization of therapies to
reduce non-responder rates and patient identification for CRT, conduction system pacing (CSP), and LV
endocardial pacing (LVEP) therapies using physics-based modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine
learning (ML). Coronary flow and electromechanics models will be coupled bi-directionally. We pioneered
modeling of this coupling that includes coronary flow regulation mechanisms. These studies suggest a
threshold in coronary perfusion, depending on the ischemia location and size, where CRT is ineffective (i.e.,
“point of no return”). With patient-specific data, we can translate our swine-specific models to the clinic, as we
did for our study on the effects of an LV assist device on a failing human biventricular unit. This work will be
accomplished by the following two Specific Aims: (1) Modify an existing experimentally-validated cardiac
electro-mechanics-perfusion computational framework to simulate the acute effects of CRT, CSP, and
LVEP in treating mechanical dyssynchrony in LBBB + ischemia; and (2) Integrate the computational
modeling framework with ML and optimization algorithms to optimize CRT, CSP, and LVEP in patients
with ischemia. This proposal will provide a software tool for optimizing therapies to reduce non-responder
rates and patient identification for CRT, CSP, and LVEP therapies. This would have a substantial impact on
improving treatment and reducing the healthcare cost of the HF epidemic. A successful Phase I will pave the
way to Phase II to advance this technology through regulatory approval of software as a medical device to
improve CRT outcomes."
10907676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disease listed in top 10 and top 15 most disabling
illnesses in women and men, respectively, according to the Lancet in 2017 and has a predicted prevalence of
2.3% in the United States. OCD is characterized symptomatically in humans by obsessive thought patterns
and compulsive motor behaviors. Synaptic deficits have been linked to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental
diseases, including OCD, but the influence of disease-linked synaptic proteins on cellular, circuit, and
behavioral outputs are incompletely understood. SAPAP3 is a synaptic protein, whose mutation is correlated
with OCD diagnosis in humans. Constitutive SAPAP3 deletion in mice produces compulsive motor grooming
behaviors, which are rescued by chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and
striatum-localized SAPAP3 re-expression. The SAPAP3-deletion model of OCD, therefore, has symptomatic
as well as treatment validity and can be used to investigate cellular- and circuit-level striatal dysfunctions
underlying this compulsive motor phenotype. Preliminary evidence highlights striatal cholinergic interneurons
(ChIs) as a likely contributor of widespread striatal dysregulation in this model. These cells display increased
evoked release of Acetylcholine (ACh) in the SAPAP3-lacking striatum, which can modulate striatal circuits
through myriad subtypes of widely expressed ACh receptors. This proposal combines electrophysiology,
optogenetics, and 2-photon scanning laser microscopy (2PLSM) to test the overarching hypothesis, that
functional dysregulation of ChIs is tied to maladaptive striatal ACh release and compulsive motor behavior in
the SAPAP3-lacking model.
In (Aim 1), patch-clamp electrophysiology in ex vivo brain slices will be used to compare intrinsic ChI function,
and brain slice immunohistochemistry will be used to probe synaptic ACh release machinery. This will uncover
SAPAP3 deletion’s impacts on intrinsic functional properties related to ACh release by ChIs. (Aim 2) will
leverage viral optogenetic and ACh sensor constructs, electrophysiology, and 2PLSM to test for input-specific
changes to synaptically evoked striatal ACh release. Finally, (Aim 3) will selectively rescue SAPAP3
expression in ChIs to test if this model’s disrupted striatal ACh release and OCD-like phenotype are intrinsically
driven by SAPAP3-deletion in these cells. This will inform whether ChI-targeted therapies may be sufficient to
modify this OCD-like circuit and behavioral phenotype."
10907836,"Abstract: Older people require specific care when undergoing an operation, principally because events around
surgery and anesthesia can precipitate delirium. The prevalence of postoperative delirium depends on type of
surgery, but an overall postoperative incidence of 17% is a reasonable estimate. The pathophysiological
mechanisms that underpin postoperative delirium and its sequelae have yet to be systematically studied. Certain
pathways may account for the development of delirium itself, while others may drive longer-term cognitive
outcomes such as progression of dementia. The degree to which these interrelate, are separate or shared is
completely unknown. One approach to investigate the neural basis of delirium has been to use CSF samples
obtained through regional anesthesia. We propose investigating the neural basis of delirium by using CSF
samples obtained in the course of spinal anesthesia, combining biomarkers with clinical and demographic
information. Our preliminary data indicates arginine metabolism may be a predictor of delirium in CSF. In this
study we aim to extend on our previous work, and accurately quantify all arginine related metabolites and
complement this data set with protein expression levels for this metabolic cascade. Our goal is to develop a
comprehensive picture of arginine metabolism in CSF and correlate these results with current pathophysiological
biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease. Further, having extended our biochemical coverage of arginine metabolism,
we will develop novel biomarkers capable of predicting those patients at greatest risk of developing delirium and
subsequent cognitive decline. Having defined the biochemical signature of delirium, it will be important to
determine which patients later developed dementia and/or significant neurodegeneration following surgery.
Therefore, we will complete a long term follow up of our original patients to determine who developed Alzheimer’s
disease or one of its related dementias and correlate those findings with our results. Moreover, and to ensure
the validity of our delirium biomarker panel, we will prospectively recruit participants undergoing planned joint
replacement surgery at Beaumont Health (>4,000 at Beaumont Royal Oak, 2018), perform pre-operative clinical
and cognitive assessments and postoperative delirium screening. Having access to such a large and diverse
patient population will provide the us with an optimal, independent validation set. In summary, our overarching
goals for this proposal are to: (i) develop an existing collaboration with the largest CSF-delirium repository to
date (n=358) in order to extend on current findings; (ii) develop new biomarker panels; (iii) perform a long term
follow up of our initial cohort and (iv) validate our findings in a large and diverse US based population."

Preclinical imaging is widely used in cancer research to devise novel tumor detection strategies, assess tumor
burden and physiology/biology, as well as to validate novel therapeutic strategies and predictive and biomarkers
of response to therapy. More recently, the use of patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) and genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) has ushered an era of co-clinical trials where preclinical studies can inform
clinical trials, thus potentially bridging the translational gap in cancer research. However, differences in the
deployment of the instruments, differences in imaging formats and protocols, differences in animal models, and
variability in analytic pipelines among other factors result in non-tractable data and poor reproducibility.
Importantly, current databases are not compatible with complexity and growing demands in preclinical cancer
imaging which include big data needs and collection of metadata/annotation to support NCI’s precision medicine
initiative. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop a unifying imaging informatics and workflow management
platform to support cancer research, which will ultimately support the premise of translational precision medicine.
We propose to develop an open-source preclinical imaging informatics platform—Preclinical Imaging XNAT-
enabled Informatics (PIXI)—to manage the workflow of preclinical imaging laboratories, harmonize imaging
databases, and enable deployment of analytic and computational pipelines in preclinical imaging. PIXI will be
based on XNAT as the underlying informatics architecture. XNAT is used by over 200 academic institutions and
industry entities as the backbone for data management across a wide range of imaging applications in clinical
research, and thus offers a robust platform for the development and deployment of PIXI. Through this effort, we
will 1) develop the PIXI database and server to capture preclinical imaging associated data, metadata, and
preclinical imaging workflow and experiments; 2) develop the PIXI “point-of-service” interface, notebook
capabilities, and software development kit (SDK); and 3) develop the PIXI container-based application (“App”)
environment to implement portable analytic pipelines. Overall, the development of a preclinical imaging
informatics platform is expected to have a profound impact on the management of preclinical imaging in cancer
research which will ultimately support translational precision medicine."

Brain metastasis is prevalent among patients with metastatic breast cancer. Brain metastasis can emerge as
multi-focal, inoperable, and radiation-resistant lesions and remains a leading cause of death for breast cancer
patients. No effective therapies nor cures are currently available for breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM).
Emerging evidence indicates that one of the rate-limiting steps in brain metastatic evolution is the overt
outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells through concurrent engagement of proliferative and survival pathways.
One key protein involved in these pathways is the Yes Associated Protein (YAP) transcriptional co-activator.
YAP is a target of the Hippo signaling cascade; its nuclear localization and association with the TEAD family
transcription factors activates downstream genes required for proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Work
from Dr. Er (co-PI) and others have shown that YAP-TEAD association is necessary and sufficient for breast
cancer cells’ metastatic outgrowth in the brain downstream of cell adhesion signaling and
mechanotransduction, suggesting that targeting the YAP-TEAD interaction can potentially provide clinical
benefit for inhibiting metastatic outgrowth of disseminated cancer cells in the brain. Several TEAD auto-
palmitoylation inhibitors such as VT104 have been identified as a new class of potent YAP inhibitors that can
effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. However, one challenge in using these drugs for
brain metastasis treatment is their limited accumulation to the multi-focal metastatic lesions because of the
presence of multiple biological barriers such as the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers. Currently existing
drug delivery approaches are not sufficiently effective in overcoming these barriers. Driven by this pressing
need, we propose to develop a macrophage-based technology (Macrophage Enabled brain Metastasis
Targeting, MEMT) for targeted delivery of YAP/TEAD-targeting drugs to multi-focal brain metastases. MEMT is
composed of macrophages carrying YAP inhibitor loaded nanoparticles (NPs) on their surface. Leveraging the
active migration of macrophages toward tumor, MEMT shuttles surface-anchored NPs to brain metastatic
lesions. We hypothesize that targeted disruption of the YAP-TEAD interaction in metastatic cells enabled by
MEMT could inhibit metastasis growth, offering a new approach for treating BCBM. Two independent aims
have been planned. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize MEMT capable of delivering NPs to multi-focal
brain metastatic lesions. We will study the tissue- and cell-level distribution of MEMT to assess its capability in
delivering NPs to brain metastatic lesions in murine and humanized BCBM models. In Aim 2, by incorporating
a preclinically-tested YAP inhibitor into MEMT, we will evaluate MEMT’s efficacy in disrupting the YAP-TEAD
interaction and inhibiting brain metastasis progression in vivo. If successful, MEMT will revolutionize how
BCBM can be effectively targeted/treated and opens a new avenue for clinical research by unlocking
unrealized applications of YAP/TEAD-targeting drugs in treating brain metastases."

Therapeutic Potential of Macromolecules: The human interactome, potentially comprising over 650,000
protein-protein interactions (PPIs), remains an underexplored frontier for therapeutics discovery. As just one
example, the interaction between the melanoma antigen, MAGE-A4, and an E3 ligase, RAD18, is hypothesized
to increase DNA damage tolerance, leading to increased resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapies.
Disrupting this interaction could increase the efficacy of chemotherapies.
Macromolecule therapeutics (e.g., peptides and peptidomimetics) are well-suited to disrupt disease-causing
PPIs. However, their design is non-intuitive with challenges including entropic costs associated with protein
binding and limited cell permeability. While existing strategies to decrease the entropic cost, like peptide stapling
and cyclization, have yielded potent therapeutics, they often result in molecules locked in a rigid conformation
that struggle to access their targets within cells due to poor permeability. Interestingly, some bioactive peptides
and peptidomimetics have been identified benefit from some lack of rigidity for cell permeability. Identifying the
role of macromolecule conformation, i.e., degree of disorder, in desirable properties including protein binding
and cell permeability will facilitate the development of a new class of therapeutics.
We propose that compact, yet non-rigid, macromolecules offer valuable, yet under exploited scaffolds for
bioactive macromolecules. This proposal aims to address key biological questions: How does macromolecule
conformation impact binding to “undruggable” protein surfaces and other essential characteristics, such as cell
permeability?
Accelerating Innovation in Macromolecule Therapeutic Design: Our vision is to accelerate the design of
macromolecule-based therapeutics by developing rapid characterization strategies that guide predictive
algorithms. These methods will provide unprecedented comparisons of macromolecule conformation, guiding
the design of macromolecular therapeutics. Three key challenges are addressed in this proposal:
 1. Conformational Characterization: We will establish colorimetric and fluorimetric assays to assess
 average conformation and dynamics of disordered peptides and peptidomimetics.
 2. Predictive Algorithm Development: Develop algorithms capable of identifying sequence spaces that
 favor conformations with a desired degree of disorder.
 3. Protein-Protein Interaction Disruption: By leveraging favorable sequences with desired
 conformations, we will identify effective, cell permeable, disruptors of protein-protein interactions using
 the MAGE-A4 and E3 ligase interaction as a model system.
Innovation and Impact: We aim to provide powerful predictive capabilities that leverage rapid conformational
characterization to guide the design of potent macromolecule therapeutics, specifically for PPI disruption."
10919771,"Over 70% of Veterans who receive health care at the VA are overweight or obese, and obesity rates of
Veterans receiving care at the VA are higher compared to non-Veterans and Veterans who do not use the VA.
Obesity contributes to loss of mobility which is a significant determinant of morbidity and loss of independence.
Obesity also is associated with elevated cardiometabolic risk factors, including lipid profile, insulin resistance,
hypertension, and inflammation. Though weight loss of as little as 3% improves physical functioning and
reduces type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, most subjects are unsuccessful at long-term weight
maintenance, regaining almost half the weight lost within the following two years and return to baseline weight
within the next 3-5 years. This clinical trial takes on the challenge of maintaining weight reduction by altering
energy balance and possibly skeletal muscle substrate oxidation to mitigate weight regain in overweight and
obese older Veterans with mobility limitations.
 The objective of this award proposal is to test in a randomized clinical trial the effectiveness of an
intensive weight management program with and without intermittent fasting (IF) to combat weight regain and
the obesity crisis in our Veterans. IF refers to short periods of intense energy restriction. We propose to enroll a
total of 200 overweight and obese Veterans with mobility impairments into a 12 weeks weight loss program
that incorporates a low calorie Heart Healthy (HH) diet and exercise at the Baltimore and Atlanta VAMCs.
Following weight loss (WL), Veterans will be randomized to weight maintenance (WM: continuation of HH and
exercise guidelines) program or weight maintenance with intermittent fasting (WM+IF) for 24 weeks. Our
central hypothesis is that IF will provide the stimulus for prevention of weight regain at 36 weeks and will
improve cardiometabolic and functional health factors. Further, we hypothesize that the ability to appropriately
modify fuel utilization through skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation enzymes is an important factor in weight
maintenance and weight regain.
 This CSR&D Clinical Trial Merit Award introduces an innovative practice of IF to prevent weight relapse
after clinically significant weight reduction and could provide evidence-based recommendations to promote this
type of intervention in the Veteran population."

 This program aims to develop new chemical methods for the practical synthesis of bioactive cyclic and
microcin J25-inspired lasso peptide scaffolds. Cyclic bioactive peptide natural products with oxidative linkages
at tyrosine (Tyr), and other phenolic residues, have inspired our development of residue-selective strategies to
prepare Tyr-linked (poly)cyclic peptides. Developed peptide cyclization methods will immediately support
applications toward constrained antimicrobial peptides. Over the next five years, we will develop strategies to
prepare cyclic/bicyclic peptides and demonstrate their potential as antimicrobial peptide therapeutic leads.
Targeted applications will prepare structure-stabilized antimicrobial peptides with anticipated activity against
multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria. This program also outlines an integrated experimental and
computational platform to address the standing challenge of microcin J25-inspired lasso peptide chemical
synthesis. This innovative approach will develop methods to enable reversible cyclization and provide informed
folding stabilization criteria to access synthetic microcin J25-inspired lasso peptides. We will iteratively guide this
process with molecular dynamics simulations to quantify lasso fold stability and probability. Longer term, we
anticipate that developed peptide cyclization and lassoing methods will enable the design and synthesis of novel
peptide therapeutic scaffolds to address challenging human disease targets."

The Dissemination, Implementation, and Community Engagement (DICE) Core recognizes the transformative
potential of well-equipped and diverse teams of scholars, scientists, and clinicians collaborating with patients,
advocates, and communities to drive meaningful and sustained progress in addressing rheumatic and
musculoskeletal disease (RMDs), both in the Deep South and nationally. Led by a strong multi-disciplinary
team with expertise in D&I science, community engagement, research recruitment, virtual/digital, and other
novel strategies, the DICE Core will endeavor to make notable strides towards realizing health equity and
enhancing health outcomes for underrepresented racial/ethnic groups and rural populations by pursuing the
following aims: Aim 1: To Facilitate the Recruitment of Diverse People Living with RMDs for BIGDATA
Research Projects. The DICE Core will aid in the adoption and implementation of evidence-based innovative
strategies for engaging underrepresented race/ethnic and rural populations, ensuring their meaningful
participation in RMD research studies. Via hybrid engagement methods, including online communities and
registries, social media campaigns, and direct-to-patient recruitment approaches, DICE will promote inclusivity
to reach these underrepresented groups. Aim 2. To Provide Comprehensive and Innovative Resources to
the BIGDATA Research Community in Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) Science. We will offer
comprehensive consultation and support to RMD researchers enabling them to effectively test interventions to
implement, de-implement, and disseminate evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes for people
living with RMD. Consultations will build on expertise in patient D&I theory, patient navigation, and training/
enrichment. These offerings will equip researchers with the knowledge and skills necessary to translate RMD
research discoveries into practice. Aim 3. To Engage Communities to Promote Equity in Recruitment,
Dissemination, Implementation and in other BIGDATA Research. In this cross-cutting aim, the DICE Core
will function as a conduit for enabling bidirectional communication between RMD researchers and RMD
communities by leveraging the collaboration of an overarching Patient Advisory Committee (PAC). In its
entirety, the DICE Core will assume a pivotal role in equipping investigators aligned to NIAMS-mission and the
BIGDATA subtheme of health equity and community engagement with the skills, assets, and virtual
mechanisms to propagate research discoveries effectively as well as amplify the involvement and enlistment of
historically marginalized groups. As we pursue the aims outlined by the DICE Core, we are dedicated to
fostering equity, addressing health disparities, being culturally sensitive, and responsive to the unique needs of
underrepresented populations living with RMD. We aim to bridge the gap between research and practice, to
improve patient outcomes, and to contribute to the broader goal of achieving health equity in RMD research."
10928431,"OVERALL CCCR ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the UNC CCCR is to enhance the design and conduct of clinical studies in
Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMDs) with a focus on osteoarthritis (OA), a particular
strength of our research community. Unfortunately, RMDs remain a major burden to patients and society.
Many RMDs are rare, and even those that are common, such as OA, are so heterogeneous that no effective
therapies have yet been identified. Improved understanding of phenotypes within RMDs, and individualized
management targeted to these groups, is needed to improve the health of our patients. Understanding and
incorporating phenotypic information in clinical observational studies and trials will be crucial to move
the field forward and is a major goal of our CCCR. Importantly, this pursuit will address the NIAMS long-
range plan for clinical research which emphasizes that, “clinical characterization of disease subtypes is critical
to assessment of epidemiological data and efficient design of clinical trials in these disease areas.” The
proposed renewal UNC CCCR will build on the current, transformative CCCR which has had a major impact on
OA phenotyping and precision medicine research. Although the CCCR will maintain its focus on OA, the
analytical methods used for phenotyping and precision medicine are readily applicable to other RMDs that are
strengths within our research community including RA, back pain, lupus, and myositis. Our goal is to optimize
the design, analysis and implementation of clinical studies and trials in OA and other RMDs to advance
clinical care and public health efforts targeted toward individuals with these conditions through the
following aims: 1) Administrative Core: Provide leadership, oversight, coordination, evaluation, and general
administrative support for all CCCR activities; 2) Methodology Core: Provide a comprehensive suite of state-of-
the-art resources to optimize the quality, efficiency and innovation of the CCCR research community that
includes local, national and international members; 3) Phenotyping and Precision Medicine Resource Core:
Develop and characterize a new, high value, real-world data resource while continuing to provide consultative
services around phenotyping and precision medicine analyses and training/educational opportunities in data
science. The combined and integrated activities proposed in the three cores combined with the extensive and
successful research community, make for a Center that truly is greater than the sum of its individual parts. This
CCCR will provide a unique resource to benefit those working in RMD research but ultimately all those
who have or might develop RMDs."
10929320,"The Administration Core (Core A) will have primary responsibility for overall scientific and financial
management of the P01. The overall mission of this P01 is to assemble a comprehensive program that integrates
bioinformatic and genomic expertise to enable not only identification of disease-causing variants in individuals
with SCID and T cell deficiencies, but also to exploit genome editing as a truly personalized approach to
treatment. The P01will have three research Projects: Project 1,Systematic identification of candidate
disease-causing variants in patients with T cell insufficiency; Project 2. Genome editing to create,
validate and correct allelic variants responsible for T cell insufficiency; and Project 3, Functional analysis
of allelic variants responsible for T cell insufficiency. These will be complemented by three Cores (including
this one): Core A, Administration; Core B, Informatics Infrastructure and Bioinformatics Analysis; and
Core C, Participant Enrollment and Sample Management. The Administration Core will meet its
responsibility by implementing four specific aims: 1) Provide strong scientific leadership; 2) Provide
administrative support; 3) Provide fiscal oversight and management of all P01 activities; and 4) Facilitate all
planning and evaluation activities for the P01. This work will ensure effective progress, optimal utilization of
resources, and enhancement of the synergies among P01 investigators and Projects. The Administration Core
includes a Steering Committee consisting the Co-Principal Investigators and the Project and Core Leads, which
will be responsible for reviewing progress and making major decisions, and will be based at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF)."
10929324,"CORE C, Human Participants and Sequencing: ABSTRACT
The past decade has seen a rapid increase in diagnosis of genetic primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs)
involving T lymphocyte dysfunction, in part due to the advent of population based newborn screening for
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). This Program Project will combine new approaches that utilize
deep sequencing, high-throughput cellular screening, genomics, gene editing, and functional testing in cellular
systems and animal models to transform our understanding of human lymphocyte differentiation and function,
and to create new, personalized treatments for affected individuals. The Projects and Cores of this Program
will address the major challenges that have stood in the way of realizing this transformation by integrating
clinical data from T-cell insufficient patients with basic investigations drawing on the expertise of leaders in
immunology, bioinformatics, target validation, and genome editing. The Human Participants and Sequencing
Core (Core C) serves the essential roles for the entire Program of (i) enrolling the human subjects, and (ii)
conducting the deep sequencing. Subjects to be studied will be patients with T cell insufficiency or severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) whose genetic diagnosis is unproven despite having had known genes
responsible for these conditions investigated. Parents will be enrolled also. Core C will be the entry point and
tracking hub for: informed consent, receiving samples, and collecting and recording phenotypic data (Aim 1);
preparing samples for studies to be carried out by all the Projects and Cores (Aim 2); and obtaining special
samples, including CD34+ primary cells from SCID patients for Projects 2 and 3 (Aim 3). Furthermore, Core C
will obtain genomic DNA and cell-subset RNA sequencing for all Projects (Aim 2), sharing it, as permitted, with
national databases to contribute to publicly available de-identified information on rare diseases (Aim 4)."
10905742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this R21 application is to develop methods to predict how the presence of multiple subtypes
of ventricular cardiomyocytes influences cardiac function. Recent studies using single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) have documented the presence of multiple cardiomyocyte subtypes, but these are described only
in terms of gene expression patterns, and their functional consequences remain unclear. We will use a
combination of approaches in this exploratory project to advance the linkage of gene expression to
physiological function. We will first perform scRNAseq on purified cultures of CMs derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate primary data about CM subtypes. Simulations with mechanistic
mathematical models will then serve as a computational bridge linking gene expression and function, and
physiological experiments to measure action potentials and intracellular [Ca2+] waveforms will test the
predictions generated by the simulations.
This R21 grant proposal is submitted in response to Notice of Special Interest NOT-HL-21-024, “Bold New
Bioengineering Research for Heart, Lung, Blood and Sleep Disorders and Diseases.” The major advance of
the planned research will be the development of computational tools, based on mechanistic models, that can
link scRNAseq data to experimentally-testable predictions. The work will therefore not only provide new insight
into cardiomyocyte subtypes, but will also deliver strategies and tools that can be applied in other contexts.
This proposal combines the expertise of PI Eric Sobie, in cardiac physiology and mathematical modeling, with
co-Is Ravi Iyengar, in systems biology and omics experiments, and Jens Hansen in computational analysis of
omics data. The combined efforts of the investigators will generate new quantitative data and will yield new
computational methods that can be applied broadly to understand cell subtypes in different contexts.
To achieve the overall project goals, we will combine three complementary approaches, scRNAseq,
mechanistic mathematical modeling, and physiological assays to test modeling predictions, as summarized in
the following general goals:
 1. Use scRNAseq to determine the characteristics and abundances of different subtypes in purified
 cultures of myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells.
 2. Perform simulations with mechanistic mathematical models to predict functional consequences of the
 presence of multiple cardiomyocyte subtypes.
 3. Test predictions of the simulations in experiments measuring action potentials and intracellular calcium
 in purified cultures of cardiomyocytes."
10907708,"ABSTRACT
Subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have three- to six-fold higher fracture risk compared with subjects without
diabetes, and although bone mineral density (BMD) – the clinical standard to assess osteoporosis and fracture
risk – is lower in subjects with T1D compared to controls, BMD alone cannot explain the disproportionate
increase in fracture risk associated with T1D. The risk of fracture in middle-age and older subjects with long-
standing T1D might be compounded by young-onset T1D, the accumulation of advanced glycation end
products (AGEs) due to chronic hyperglycemia, or by a potential superimposition of aging and long-term T1D
effects on bone. The “Bone Health in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes” study (R01DK122554) aims to explore BMD
and bone strength at the hip using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) in subjects with long-standing
T1D and age-, sex- and body mass index-matched controls, as well as to investigate the effects of chronic
hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia on bone health. However, bone strength – the main determinant of bone
fracture – is determined by BMD, bone quality, and its microenvironment including bone marrow adipose
tissue. Therefore, we propose an ancillary study to the “Bone Health in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes” parent
study and leverage its well-characterized cohort of subjects, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data to assess
phenotypes of bone marrow adiposity (BMA) and bone microstructure in middle-age and older subjects with
long-standing T1D using advanced imaging and image analysis techniques. Using chemical shift-based water-
fat separation magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography
(HR-pQCT) we aim to assess differences in 24-month changes in BMA at the proximal femur and in bone
microstructure at the distal radius and distal tibia between middle-age and older subjects with long-standing
T1D and controls without diabetes. Furthermore, differences in the spatial distribution of 24-month changes in
BMA between the two groups will be investigated using voxel-based morphometry; and the associations of
chronic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia with 24-month changes in BMA and bone microstructure will also be
explored. Due to the increase incidence of T1D and improved medical care, the life expectancy of subjects with
T1D is expected to increase, and although subjects with T1D have an increased risk of fracture during the
entire life, most fractures occur at older age when the total fracture burden is greatest in the general
population. Therefore, there is a critical need to better understand the etiology of T1D-related bone disorders to
develop clinical strategies to prevent clinically and economically costly fractures in this large vulnerable
population."
10907416,"Prostate cancer is the most common deadly cancer of men. Bone metastasis is a painful complication of
advanced prostate cancer associated with significant morbidity. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a prostate cancer-
secreted factor that activates the osteoblast endothelin A receptor (ETAR) causing osteoblast proliferation and
pathologic new bone formation. In turn, osteoblasts send chemotactic and growth cues back to the prostate
cancer cells. Preliminary data have unexpectedly demonstrated that ablation of both ET-1 and androgen action
in osteoblasts is necessary to reduce bone lesion growth in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Furthermore, osteoblast generation of active androgens from adrenal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) further
fuels osteoblast-directed prostate cancer progression in bone.
 The goals of this proposal are to investigate the actions of ET-1 and androgen on tumor burden in an
animal model prostate cancer bone metastasis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the effects of
castration and DHEA replacement combined with ETAR blockade in a “humanized” animal model of prostate
cancer bone metastasis. Scid mice will undergo castration or sham surgery, and treatment with the ETAR
antagonist zibotentan or a vehicle control. The effects of sustained-release DHEA to negate the effects of
combined zibotentan and castration on the development of prostate cancer skeletal lesions will be tested. It is
expected that DHEA treatment, in castrated mice treated with ETAR blockade, will increase the development
and/or size of prostate cancer lesions in bone compared to control mice not receiving DHEA. Aim 2 will
examine the effects of Hsd3b7 knockout on the progression of prostate cancer bone lesions in DHEA-treated
mice. It is hypothesized that the protein encoded by Hsd3b7 is responsible for osteoblast conversion of DHEA
to androstenedione, and androstenediol to testosterone. It is expected that knockout of Hsd3b7 will negate the
effects of DHEA on the development of prostate cancer lesions in castrated mice treated with ETAR blockade.
Aim 3 will determine if combined ETAR blockade and androgen depletion prevents the initiation of skeletal
lesions, the progression of established lesions, or both. The combination of castration and ETAR
pharmacologic blockade reduced the number of skeletal lesions in a mouse model of bone metastasis
compared to either alone. The timing of androgen depletion and ETAR blockade required to reduce skeletal
tumor burden is unknown. Male scid mice will undergo castration or sham surgery before inoculation of tumor
cells or at the point when skeletal lesions have been established. It is expected that the combination of
androgen depletion and ETAR blockade will prevent both the initiation and the progression of established
lesions.
 ADT is the standard treatment in men with metastatic prostate cancer, but disease progression to CRPC
and bone metastases in most men mark the fatal form of the disease. The clinical implication of this research is
that ETAR blockade may be effective only with maximal androgen blockade. These findings generated by this
proposal will be a catalyst for clinical trials to reduce the morbidity and mortality of CRPC in veterans."
10907561,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This is an application for a five-year K01 award for Dr. Lawrence Long, a Research Assistant Professor at
Boston University. The K01 award will support a complementary set of training activities and research aims
aimed at establishing Dr. Long as an independent researcher in the field of HIV prevention and behavioral
economics. This will allow Dr. Long to reach his long-term career goal of leading HIV research that guides the
design of health delivery programs (treatment and prevention) which encourages optimal health behavior and
decision making. The K01 will provide the support necessary to accomplish the following training goals: 1) to
obtain expert technical knowledge in the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men who have sex with
men; 2) to learn, master and apply the theory of human decision making; 3) to become skilled in the design
and implementation of behavior change interventions and 4) to successfully apply for independent research
funding. In order to achieve these training goals Dr. Long has proposed a career development plan centered
around strong mentorship supported by didactic training in behavioral economics, qualitative research
methods, and research approaches for working with vulnerable populations. Despite the largest HIV treatment
program in the world South Africa’s HIV incidence remains high, in particular amongst key populations such as
men who have sex with men (MSM). The recent inclusion of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as part of
the national prevention package in South Africa is considered key to reducing incidence in these populations,
yet pilot studies show sub optimal uptake and poor persistence amongst those most at risk. Dr. Long’s
research will focus on understanding why PrEP uptake and persistence amongst MSM in South Africa is low
and how the delivery of PrEP to this population could be altered to encourage those most at risk to start
treatment. The research will aim to: 1) identify predictors of PrEP initiation and persistence amongst South
African MSM testing negative at PREP pilot sites; 2) qualitatively examine the role of cognitive bias in the
decision to request, offer, accept and continue on PrEP from a health care provider and patient perspective;
and 3) develop and pilot a simple intervention to increase the uptake of and persistence on PrEP in MSM using
behavioral economic theory to improve decision making. In order to accomplish these aims Dr. Long has
access to the two pilot sites currently offering PrEP to MSM in South Africa. Before the completion of the K01
award Dr. Long will use this research as the basis for an R01 grant application which would aim to conduct a
randomized control trial to establish the effectiveness of behavioral economic interventions in improving PrEP
uptake amongst various key populations."
10908480,"Physical and chemical sensing enables detection of functional states of individual end organs for state-
dependent neuromodulation. NEST 5 focuses on developing robust sensors for temperature, motility, pH,
acetylcholine, and catecholamines, and performing extensive benchtop testing to ensure reliable in vivo
performance for end organ sensing.
 Proper functioning of end-organs is dependent on the local organ temperature. Therefore, accurate, in vivo
temperature sensing of end organs can provide valuable information on their functional states. We will develop
micropatterned platinum thin film-based resistive temperature sensors encapsulated in Parylene C for in vivo
temperature sensing.
 Motility of certain end organs is associated with their functional states such as esophagus expansion and
sphincter contraction. We will develop resistive and capacitive strain sensors encapsulated in Parylene C or
polyurethane for motility sensing of target end organs. We will conformally coat commercial bend sensors with
Parylene C as encapsulation and suture them in a pre-bent configuration to convert contraction and expansion
to bending deformations. In parallel, we will conformally coat a commercial stretchable capacitive sensor with
polyurethane as stretchable encapsulation.
 Acetylcholine functions both as a neuromuscular transmitter and neuromodulator, and is found in the central
and peripheral neurons, in target organs of the parasympathetic nervous systems. NEST 5 develops
electrochemical acetylcholine sensor using an enzyme-free sensing membrane doped with an organic and stable
receptor. We will integrate the sensing membrane in a Parylene-C based platinum microarray. The end-organ
electrochemical sensing of pH can be used for detecting functional states of individual end organs for enabling
state-dependent neuromodulation. We will develop a platinum microarray on a Parylene substrate and
electrodeposit iridium oxide as the active pH sensing material.
 The end-organ electrochemical sensing of catecholamines, and norepinephrine (NE) in particular, can be
used for detecting the efficacy of autonomic neuromodulation on restoring the sympathetic-parasympathetic
balance, as well as functional or disease states in organs and the body. We will develop a platinum microarray
on a Parylene substrate and detecting catecholamines using the established methodology of fast scan cyclic
voltammetry. Extensive thermally accelerated benchtop testing will be performed in saline for all sensing
modules to de-risk the technology for long-term end organ sensing. Electrochemical sensing modules will be
tested pooled serum media (in addition to saline solutions) for evaluation of sensor biofouling."
10908563,"Neuron loss is a frequent result of neural injury or degeneration. A fundamental but unresolved challenge is how
to restore the lost neurons and repair the neural circuits in the adult central nervous system. Stem cell-based
transplantation has limitations on immune compatibility, neuronal survival, and functional integration; and it has
the potential for tumorigenesis. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define innovative regenerative strategies
by using a patient’s own scar-forming cells without cell transplantation. In response to injury or neural
degeneration, glial cells become reactive, proliferate, and form scars. Scar formation is initially beneficial by
restricting damage but ultimately detrimental to neural regeneration through acting as a physical and chemical
barrier to axonal regeneration and growth. Our prior research showed that reactive astrocytes can be in vivo
reprogrammed to expandable neural progenitors, which can further produce mature neurons in the adult central
nervous system. The current proposal will focus on NG2 glia, another major component of the glial scar. Our
preliminary data indicate that they can be in vivo reprogrammed to become neurogenic. We here propose to
determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the reprogramming process of NG2 glia in adult
mouse. We will also examine the excitability and synaptic integrations of the induced neurons from NG2 glia.
Finally, we will investigate the biological function of these newly generated neurons in a mouse model of neural
injury. Results from this work may lead to paradigm-shifting regeneration-based therapeutic strategies for neural
injury and degeneration."
10908569,"Project Summary
The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050,
contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already
stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive
impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that
even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have
documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this
project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini-
Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record
(EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop
and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients
and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools
they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing
web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already
seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic
diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically
validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic.
After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30
primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician
confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS
system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in
adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We
will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart
audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change
theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to
evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system
is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform
already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as
described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a
prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care
and guidance within primary care."
10906566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The blood brain barrier (BBB), formed by vascular endothelial and supporting cells, functions to regulate blood-
brain exchange of substances and cells, and to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from neurotoxins and
pathogens. Building on our efforts toward ameliorating HIV-associated CNS complications and achieving HIV
cure, we now must address the growing evidence that BBB impairment is associated with acute and/or repeated
cocaine use
. Cocaine misuse (intranasal, intravenous, inhalation) is common
among people living with HIV
(PLWH) and viral reservoirs in brain can be seeded by infected immune cells that penetrate the BBB
. As the field
pursues new strategies to mitigate CNS consequences of HIV infection in the context of substance use, and
achieve cure, it will be critical to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected cells and cocaine impact BBB
integrity and the subsequent consequences on both the viral reservoir and cognition in PLWH. We
propose a
central model wherein historical cocaine misuse causes a persistent deficit in BBB integrity that underlies
cognitive impairment in PLWH. In this model, PLWH with historical cocaine use disorder (CUDH) 1) have higher
prevalence of CCR2+ALCAM+ intermediate monocytes that harbor HIV proviral DNA and migrate to the brain,
and 2) this higher prevalence of CCR2+ALCAM+ intermediate monocytes results in increased transmigration
across the BBB disrupting BBB permeability and tight junctions (TJ).
In vivo studies in humans have not assessed
CUDH
and long-term BBB integrity in PLWH. The recent development of the Water-extraction-with-phase-
contrast-arterial-spin-tagging (WEPCAST) MRI sequence facilitates in vivo measurement of BBB permeability to
small molecules without contrast. We propose using WEPCAST MRI to assess BBB integrity in vivo in 175 PLWH
with CUDH
and 75 PLWH without CUDH. We will determine the effect of immune cell phenotypes, HIV proviral
DNA burden and in vitro alterations to BBB TJ on in vivo BBB integrity in PLWH with and without CUDH. Aim
1: Determine the contribution of immune cell phenotypes to BBB permeability in PLWH with and without CUDH.
We will assess BBB permeability via WEPCAST in relation to monocyte and T cell phenotypes implicated in
transmigration of activated cells across the BBB. Aim 2: Determine the contribution of immune cells harboring
HIV proviral DNA to BBB permeability in PLWH with and without CUDH. We will assess HIV proviral DNA via the
Intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) in monocytes and CD4 T cells in relation to BBB permeability via
WEPCAST. Aim 3: Determine mechanisms by which monocytes that harbor HIV proviral DNA increase BBB
permeability in PLWH with CUDH. We will assess BBB permeability using an in vitro model of the BBB to elucidate
how HIV infected monocytes shape BBB tight junctions.
Our in vivo study utilizing a noninvasive BBB integrity
measure combined with immunophenotyping, reservoir analysis and a mechanistic approach to determine the
effect on BBB TJ are highly innovative. Data will provide support for addressing BBB integrity in PLWH with
CUDH and guide investigation of therapeutics aimed to promote BBB health in substance use disorders."
10909072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Development of liver metastases among stage I-III colorectal cancer (CRC) patients following resection
suggests the presence of clinically undetectable liver micro-metastases prior to CRC diagnosis. Non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quickly emerging as the most common liver disease worldwide with
an estimated prevalence of 20-30% in the U.S. population. To date, various lines of evidence support our
hypothesis of the potential role of liver fat in enhancing CRC liver metastasis; the next step is to
demonstrate the utility of quantitative assessment of hepatic fat as a prognostic biomarker for stage I-III
CRC patients in clinical settings. Almost all CRC patients in the U.S. get a computerized tomography (CT)
scan at diagnosis, and NAFLD is a highly prevalent and treatable disease, thus, if our hypothesis is
confirmed, we hope to establish a safe and cost-efficient prognostic biomarker, which is currently lacking.
The recently expanded C-SCANS (CRC-Sarcopenia and Near-term Survival) cohort was derived from the
Kaiser Permanente Northern California cancer registry, with ascertainment of patients with stage I-III CRC
diagnosed between 2006 and 2018, aged 18−80 years, who underwent surgical resection. Inclusion criteria
include that patients had baseline CT images within 4 months of diagnosis, and prior to treatment.
In Aim 1,
hepatic fat (quantitative assessment) will be measured in CT scans performed at time of CRC diagnosis,
and prior to treatment. First, measurements will be performed manually, and then using a novel machine
learning-based tool for liver segmentation, and measurement of liver and spleen attenuation. In Aims 2 and
3, we will examine (a) whether increased hepatic fat infiltration is associated with higher risk of liver
metastases, recurrence, and CRC mortality, and (b) whether associations are modified by comorbidities
and risk factors related to the metabolic syndrome. In Aim 4, we will examine whether hepatic fat affects
liver metastases through a direct and/or indirect effect (e.g., mediated through the metabolic syndrome).
Specifically, we hypothesize that the direct effect of hepatic fat is more important in explaining the
relationship between hepatic fat and liver metastases than the indirect effect. Data on body composition,
including
skeletal muscle and total, subcutaneous and visceral fat, and hepatic fat for each patient are
measured on the same CT scans, which combined with assessment of behavioral risk factors, clinical data,
and metabolic plasma markers around the same time , provide an unprecedented opportunity to rigorously
study these effects. Thus, this cost-efficient and innovative application will address the urgent need for
more accurate prognostic biomarkers and relatively safe interventions to improve prognosis in stage I to III
CRC patients. Considering the alarming rise in prevalence of NAFLD, this application has the potential to
reduce morbidity and mortality in a substantial number of stage I-III CRC patients."
10909073,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells for which new treatments and precision guided
approaches are acutely needed. Current treatments target the plasma cell biology thought to be common to all
myeloma. However, response to these treatments is highly variable pointing to an underlying heterogeneity in
biology. One recently identified source of heterogeneity with important therapeutic implications involves
dependence on the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which includes Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. These proteins regulate cell
survival and are the targets of a new class of drugs being studied for use in myeloma. Although both normal
plasma cells and myeloma are typically dependent on Mcl-1 for survival, a subset of myeloma with a B cell-like
phenotype is Bcl-2 dependent and sensitive to venetoclax, a Bcl-2 specific inhibitor. This B cell phenotype is
notable because B cells are also Bcl-2 dependent and B cell malignancies such as CLL are highly sensitive to
venetoclax. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that in a subset of myeloma, B cell
transcriptional and signaling networks remain active and contribute to Bcl-2 dependence and venetoclax
sensitivity as well as resistance to conventional plasma cell directed therapy. The studies proposed will define
the mechanisms of Bcl-2 family dependence in myeloma and identify biomarkers capable of selecting myeloma
patients most likely to respond to Bcl-2 inhibitors such as venetoclax. Aim 1 will characterize the mechanisms of
BATF3 activity, an AP-1 transcription factor that increases Bcl-2 dependence and sensitizes myeloma to
venetoclax, using genomic and epigenomic analyses on cells with CRISPR mediated BATF3 overexpression or
knockdown. Aim 2 will directly interrogate the origins of Bcl-2 dependence and intrinsic resistance to venetoclax
in myeloma using CRISPR screens targeting genes that are differentially expressed in venetoclax sensitive and
resistant cells. Finally, Aim 3 will utilize state of the art mass cytometry on ex vivo tested myeloma patient
samples to develop a novel biomarker that could be used for future precision medicine trials to predict response
to inhibitors of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1. These studies will be conducted by Dr. Vikas Gupta, whose long-term
career goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist studying the molecular pathogenesis of
multiple myeloma. He is seeking an NIH K08 career development award to acquire the additional skills necessary
for independence. With the help of a multi-disciplinary group of experts serving as mentors and advisors, he will
receive hands on training in advanced research techniques such as targeted CRISPR screens, RNA sequencing,
bioinformatics, and mass cytometry as well as mentoring in manuscript and grant writing, clinical trial
development, laboratory management, and leadership skills. Completion of the work proposed here will lay the
foundation for future R01 applications studying approaches to overcome mechanisms of resistance to Bcl-2
family inhibitors."

This CDA proposal seeks to investigate the long-term impact of modifiable health-related behaviors (e.g.,
smoking, exercise) on cognitive decline over time among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS; Specific
Aim 1). This is important given the detrimental impact of cognitive impairment in MS, affecting
symptom management, instrumental activities of daily living, and independence. Since there are no
proven treatments for cognitive impairment, it is imperative to identify modifiable risk factors –
specifically health-related behaviors – that can serve as potential treatment targets. Moreover, in order to
modify these behaviors, this proposal will explore disease (MS)-related, person-specific, and
environmental facilitators and barriers to engaging in health-related behaviors (Specific Aim 2). Such
aims are consistent with the mission of the National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research
(NCMRR) to “determine the impact of modifiable lifestyle and health-related behaviors on
prevention of secondary conditions, psychosocial functioning, and community participation,” as
outlined in the 2016 NIH Research Plan on Rehabilitation.
The Specific Aims will be accomplished via two longitudinal, observational studies among persons with
MS. Cognitive trajectories will be established by standardized neuropsychological assessments. Health-
related behaviors will be evaluated using self-report inventories. Facilitators/barriers to engaging in
health-related behaviors will be determined by quantitative inventories and qualitative semi-structured
interviews. Data from this investigation will serve as pilot data for a R01 grant in which a
multicomponent lifestyle intervention to improve cognition among persons with MS will be proposed.
Such intervention has been recently conducted in older adults at-risk of developing dementia, with
ongoing replications around the world. Information from this project will help adapt this type of
intervention to individuals with MS by accounting for MS-specific facilitators and barriers to engaging in
health behaviors.
I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team, with expertise in clinical neuropsychology,
cognitive rehabilitation, epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, and clinical trial design. By completing the
proposed training and research plans, I will be able to achieve my training goals, including: (1) applying
population-based survey research design to the role of the social determinants of health on lifestyle
behaviors; (2) learning qualitative research design and advanced statistical techniques; (3) learning how to
conduct clinical trials; and (4) honing my professional development skills, such as manuscript writing,
grantsmanship, laboratory management, and mentorship. Achieving these goals will help me transition
into an independent clinical investigator, with a long career of grant-funded research."

Most sensory hearing loss is diagnosed and treated with little distinction. Indeed, ”sensorineural hearing loss”
is a catch-all term. However, promising results over the last few years suggest that otoacoustic emissions
(OAEs) can distinguish among sensory hearing losses that appear similar by audiogram. OAEs are non-
invasive indicators of cochlear health and dysfunction that can be recorded in normal hearers and those with
up to moderate degrees of hearing impairment. Though they offer a non-invasive, pre-neural window into the
cochlea, their application in the audiology clinic has stagnated over the last two decades despite significant
advances in the laboratory. Current clinical utility of OAEs includes only the detection of hearing loss; nothing
is learned about the etiology of the hearing loss once detected. This project proposes to translate into the
audiology clinic a rapid, research-proven technique to evoke OAEs with sweeping tones, allowing for the
efficient, near-simultaneous recording of the two basic OAE classes: emissions produced by cochlear
nonlinearities such as the distortion-product OAE (DPOAE), and those produced by cochlear reflections such
as the stimulus-frequency OAE (SFOAE). These two types of emissions elucidate distinct cochlear properties,
and each is uniquely sensitive to different auditory pathologies and etiologies. Analyzing combined OAE
outcomes produces new relational metrics that exploit the unique diagnostic information offered by both, which
initiates differential diagnosis of sensory hearing loss. Additionally, our advanced OAE system has
incorporated innovative calibration techniques that mitigate the effects of ear-canal standing-wave interference,
a known source of undesirable variability. These advanced calibrations improve the test-retest reliability of
emissions, which allows for more accurate serial monitoring of hearing status and an expanded high-frequency
test range. In this project, we will: 1) integrate existing software modules that calibrate, measure, and analyze
swept-tone OAEs into a cohesive and user-friendly software program for the interleaved recording of DPOAEs
and SFOAEs; 2) analyze DPOAE and SFOAE measures in a combined fashion to detect and monitor hearing
loss and perform differential diagnosis for hearing impairments of confirmed etiology; and 3) strategically pare
down the Combined-OAE Profile and validate its performance in an independent group of participants to
produce an abbreviated clinical test for the diagnosis of sensory hearing loss. These steps will modernize and
advance OAE assessment well beyond the rudimentary goal of detecting hearing loss and provide a degree of
diagnostic specificity that will facilitate personalized intervention for individuals with hearing loss."
10909643,"The primary goal of this proposal is to hasten therapeutic development by validating outcomes and refining clinical trial strategies for pediatric-onset FSHD. Cross sectional studies have suggested an association between a younger age of onset and greater clinical severity. They also show that having 1-3 D4Z4 repeats is associated with extra-muscular complications in pediatric FSHD. Prospective studies in early-onset FSHD to date have been limited by small number of sites and low ability to recruit and follow patients. Rationale: FSHD is caused by the aberrant expression of a normally silenced gene, DUX4, which causes a toxic gain-of-function and may be a target for therapy. The key abnormality in FSHD is particularly amenable to molecular knock- down or silencing of DUX4, making strategies like the use of antisense oligonucleotide or RNA interference possible. Several pharmaceutical companies have active programs for targeted treatments in adult FSHD, and many more are planned and on the horizon over the next five years. Early-onset pediatric FSHD is a population of high interest to drug companies for the following reasons: 1) early-onset pediatric FSHD results in more significant disease burden than in adults; 2) treating FSHD at earlier ages may have a more lasting and profound effects; and 3) smaller body size and faster rates of progression may make AAV delivered gene therapies more feasible. The FSHD Clinical Trials Research Network (CTRN) will be utilized and is comprised of international academic centers, which has leveraged support from key stakeholders to create infrastructure for study coordination, evaluator training, and data management/statistical support. The study will be a prospective 24-month study of 80 pediatric FSHD participants (at least half meeting criteria for early-onset FSHD) and will validate the pediatric FSHD Composite Functional measure (FSHD-COM Peds), Reachable Workspace (RWS), and quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures intra-muscular fat content, which have shown to be responsive to disease progression or treatment in adults with FSHD and correlated to performance. The study proposes the following aims. Aim 1 will determine the validity of the pediatric FSHD COM and RWS as a primary clinical outcome assessment (COA) for FSHD clinical trials. Also, will determine multicenter test-retest reliability, cross sectional associations to other FSHD disease measures, responsiveness to FSHD disease progression, predictive baseline clinical characteristics for trial planning, and minimal clinically important changes. Aim 2 will determine the validity of qMRI as a prognostic or monitoring biomarker for FSHD clinical trials. Similar to aim 1, this determines the convergent validity, responsiveness to disease progression, and baseline cut offs useful for trial planning. At the completion of this study, the FSHD-COM Peds, RWS, and qMRI will be validated for use in pediatric FSHD clinical trials and will investigate differences between the early-onset and childhood and adolescent onset FSHD for trial planning purposes."
10929343,"Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is common, occurs more frequently in SSc than in other connective
tissue diseases and is its leading cause of death, manifesting as interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH). Only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds (nintedanib
and tocilizumab) have been shown to slow the decline of lung function in SSc-ILD, but do not stop or reverse the
progression of SSc-ILD. This highlights an unmet medical need for improved molecular understanding of SSc-
ILD pathogenesis for identification of novel targets for drug development. SSc-ILD is thought to be triggered by
immune-mediated microvascular injuries that induce and perpetuate inflammation, autoimmune responses, and
fibroblast-to-myofibroblast activation with subsequent collagen deposition ultimately leading to lung fibrosis. We
have recently provided the largest known lung proteome in human and mouse, encompassing more than 8000
proteins, uncovering novel druggable mediators and cell types driving lung fibrosis. We have identified several
shared mediators of fibrosis (e.g., the SMAD3/TGF-beta pathway) between SSc skin lesions and IPF lung tissue.
An accurate quantification and characterization of the SSc lung proteome, however, remains to be performed.
Using novel technological advances, we propose to define and quantify the intricate composition of the fibrotic
SSc lung and uncover components within the lung proteome that will serve as peripheral biomarkers and/or drug
candidates for the monitoring and treatment of SSc-ILD, respectively. The overarching goal of this application is
1) to define, in greatest detail, the molecular composition of the SSc-ILD lung and peripheral blood, 2) to
identify novel disease-specific network modules and mechanisms of tissue fibrosis for improved drug
development, and 3) to uncover proteins that can serve as diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive
biomarkers for SSC-ILD. We hypothesize that the SSc lung proteome identifies SSc-specific druggable cues,
produced by resident fibroblasts, that drive persistent lung fibrosis. We will define and quantify changes in the
composition of the proteomes of the lung and blood of SSc-ILD patients that correlate with disease
severity in cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of SSc-ILD patients. We will provide the SSc-ILD lung’s
epigenetic landscape and transcriptome at single cell resolution by performing gene expression and open
chromatin accessibility assays using Chromium single multiome ATAC + Genome Expression analysis in nuclear
preparations of lung cell suspensions. Finally, we will use a novel drug screening platform of TGF-beta-
induced Smad translocation in SSc-derived primary fibroblasts, and characterize inhibitors of the class
III phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) vacuolar protein sorting 34 (Vps34) as novel targets for the
inhibition of lung fibrosis. We will work closely with the other CORT cores and projects to generate novel data
on common and specific drivers of SSc-ILD for the identification of new druggable targets underlying the
pathobiology of fibrotic pathways in SSc-ILD."
10929347,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-PAH)
and is dependent on several vascular cell types. However, key systems of molecular cross-talk remain
enigmatic. Previously, we defined a key regulatory axis between the transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ with
the enzyme glutaminase, establishing a new paradigm of how glutamine metabolism is related to vascular
stiffness in PAH. Yet, crucial questions remain. What are the triggers that activate YAP/TAZ to initiate PAH and
do they originate from separate cell types? Downstream of those triggers, can vascular glutamine metabolism
serve as a diagnostic indicator of SSc-PAH? Our unpublished data demonstrate that platelets from SSc patients
show dysregulated mitochondrial energetics which correlate with the severity of vascular manifestations in these
patients and cause increased glutaminolysis in pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts. Hypothesis: Altered platelet
energetics signal to PA fibroblasts, resulting in specific alterations of glutamine metabolism to control
collagen deposition, vascular stiffness, and SSc-PAH. In this translational proposal, we will define the
presence of dysregulated platelet energetics and fibroblast glutamine metabolism in SSc-PAH. We will also
determine if fibroblast glutamine uptake can be targeted for the development of more effective diagnostics. Aim
1) Determine whether dysregulated platelet energetics is associated with the severity of vascular
symptoms in SSc and with lung vascular fibroblast glutaminolysis in SSc-PAH. We postulate that
dysfunctional platelet energetics can serve as a biomarker of progressive vascular damage in SSc and is
associated with increased glutaminolysis in pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts in SSc-PAH. To investigate,
platelets will be isolated from SSc-PAH, SSc, and control patients and energetic profiles will be analyzed and
correlated with measures of clinical vascular measures. In parallel, single cell RNA sequencing of human SSc-
PAH vs. control explant lungs will determine if platelet energetic transcriptional profiles correlate with vascular
fibroblast glutaminolytic profiles. Aim 2) Utilize 18F-fluoroglutamine PET imaging to measure glutamine
uptake in SSc-PAH vs. controls. We found increased glutamine uptake into pulmonary vessels and right
ventricle in rodent PAH, as quantified by PET imaging of a 18F-FGln tracer and by spectral (MIMS) imaging of
15N-glutamine. In a first-in-human study, we will investigate 18F-FGln PET/CT in SSc-PAH patients vs. SSc alone
and non-diseased controls. This aim will define the relevance of glutamine metabolism in human SSc-PAH and
the potential of 18F-FGln to serve as a novel diagnostic tracer for SSc-PAH. Significance: Our multi-disciplinary
team is uniquely positioned to define the clinical relevance of a platelet-to-fibroblast metabolism pathway critical
for inducing vascular stiffening and PAH. We will leverage those findings to embark on a first-in-human diagnostic
study of 18F-FGln PET/CT. In sum, we will define the intercellular axes that converge upon platelet and fibroblast
metabolism in SSc-PAH, thus offering much needed targeted diagnostics in this deadly disease."

improvement of GM/CA and, in consultation with Ogata and Stepanov, set long-term goals for GM/CA.
The administrative structure to operate a successful user program includes systems to receive, track and
prioritize requests for advance-scheduled and rapid-access beam time, to schedule beam time, to provide
an expert host for each user group, to receive feedback from users following their beam time, to gather
metrics on beam time use, to track user productivity in terms of publications and structural data deposited
in the PDB, and to organize beamline maintenance and improvement. Kristin Ahrens maintains
databases of users, beam time use, user publications, PDB depositions and user funding, and she
provides expert administrative support for all GM/CA activities. Dr. Michael Becker, together with Ogata

10929363,"The primary goals of the GM/CA@APS Training and Outreach Core are to train users about the advanced
technologies offered by the GM/CA macromolecular crystallography resource and to reach out to the
scientific community with information about GM/CA technologies. Dr. Janet Smith (PI) leads the Training
and Outreach Core; most GM/CA staff have roles in one or more aspects of training and outreach.
Training of both remote and on-site users is achieved through personal interactions with GM/CA staff
hosts and through videos and documentation available at the GM/CA website. The on-line materials will
be updated frequently to keep pace with the growing sophistication of the JBluIce user interface and the
associated data processing pipelines. To provide improved training for remote users, who are the majority

to user labs at locations where there are several user groups and provide hands-on training during user
beam time. We will continue to host the successful annual CCP4/APS School for Macromolecular
Crystallography, now in its twelfth year, and to teach the data collection section of the School. An
important goal is to reach out to the user community with information and training about the new
capabilities that will be available with the upgraded APS (APS-U) with its 100-fold brighter beam. We will
develop training materials and workshops to prepare for the exciting new opportunities with APS-U. We
will continue general outreach to the scientific community through staff attendance and presentations at
scientific conferences. We will also promote the GM/CA Resource by highlighting significant user results
through our website and the APS and Argonne communications offices.

10929353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The biology of multicellular organisms is organized on multiple levels. Molecular abundance and interactions
regulate cell function; Communication of cells with nearby cells and environments further shapes cellular states
and functions; Cells form highly interconnected functional networks organ-wide. Thus, a function or a dysfunction
of an organ is manifested through the orchestrated action of individual cells comprising the organ. To
mechanistically comprehend how a disease develops, we need to understand how the abnormal alteration in a
cell is translated into system-level dysfunctions. With remarkable progress in sequencing, imaging, and genetic
manipulation, researchers are now a step closer to decipher how cellular genotype gives rise to system-level
phenotype in vivo. Single-cell sequencing probes the genetic profile of individual cells comprising a tissue.
Organ-scale phenotyping, such as CLARITY, probes the detailed morphology of cells, cellular wiring, and the
spatial organization of cells throughout an organ. CRISPR-based genetic perturbation establishes causal links
between genes and phenotype in vitro at unprecedented throughput. However, these technologies mostly probe
a single facet of a complex biological system. This limitation makes it challenging to integrate information
obtained from different molecular types and scales, and to extract the mechanistic underpinning of system-level
phenotype, especially in vivo. We aim to address this critical gap by developing a transformational, multiscale,
multimodal imaging platform that screens a large tissue volume to identify cells with abnormal phenotype and
characterize the complete and quantitative molecular contents or the abnormal cells as well as nearby cells. This
platform will identify how the abnormal genetic change in a cell alters its phenotype, affects nearby cells, and
contributes to disease development. Despite its immense potential, streamlining organ-scale proteomic
phenotyping and in situ single cell transcriptomics is impossible due to the incompatibility of chemistry and
imaging requirements. We propose to develop a series of chemical tools to enable multiscale, integrative profiling
of proteins and RNAs: reversible protection of RNAs in an intact tissue; tissue transformation chemistry for multi-
omic profiling; and quantum dot-based NIR imaging platform for thick-tissue imaging. Integrating these tools, we
will develop and implement the multiscale, integrative imaging platform to characterize phenotypic abnormalities
in autistic brains, such as ectopic neuronal connections, and profile cellular transcriptome at the region of
phenotypic defects. Such study will provide a holistic view of diseased tissues to decipher pathogenic
mechanisms behind a phenotypic abnormality at a molecular level, through the identification of altered gene
expression patterns near an abnormal phenotype, intercellular communication network that leads to the system-
level phenotype, and the spatial organization of differential cell types in healthy versus diseased tissues. In
addition to enabling new biological studies, the newly developed chemical tools will drive innovations in a wide
range of biomedical science, including RNA biology, genetics, imaging, and tissue engineering."

Application Title: Workshops of the National Academies' Roundtable on Science and Welfare
in Laboratory Animal Use (ILAR Roundtable)
Funding Opportunity Title: FDA Scientific Conference Grant Program (R13); PAR-19-306.
This request is for funding from the Office of the FDA Commissioner (OC/OCS/OCET).
The Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR) of the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine established the Roundtable on Science and Welfare in Laboratory
Animal Use in the Fall of 2013. The purpose of the Roundtable is to foster communication
and problem solving among the many different constituencies with strong interests in the use
and welfare of laboratory animals in research and testing, including, government agencies,
pharmaceutical and consumer product corporations, vendors, animal advocacy groups,
professional societies, and academic institutions , including scientists and veterinarians. The
workshops will be open to the public and webcasted, and there will be no fee charged to attend
or view the workshop via the web.
This application requests funds from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to provide partial
support toward convening up to two workshops a year, beginning in 2020 for a period of five
years under the auspices of the Roundtable. Each workshop will focus on a critical issue related
to the science and welfare of laboratory animal use, such as Micro-Physiological Systems for
Efficacy and Safety Studies: A Workshop on Advances in Organs-On-Chip Technologies for
Animals; The 4th R: Rehoming and Retirement of Non-Human Primates Used in Research; the
Ethics and Use of Genetic Modifications in Xenotransplantation; and Laboratory Animal Use and
the One Health Paradigm. The workshops present opportunities for 1) outreach to and dialogue
with all communities who share an interest in the use of laboratory animals in research; 2) sharing
of cutting-edge scientific information; and 3) increased understanding of the topics and
identification of possible follow-on activities to improve the quality of biomedical research and
laboratory animal welfare.
Animal-based research is a fundamental component of the preclinical research and development
and proof-of-concept studies of drugs, biologics and medical devices. Ensuring the highest
quality of these studies while maintaining appropriate care and use of the animals used depends
on building trust and maintaining and information sharing among the research, scientific and
veterinary medical communities. As such, the purpose of Roundtable and its workshops is
consistent with the mission of the FDA: ""…protecting the public health by assuring the safety,
efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our
nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation”. "
10940859,"Nearly half of all mammalian genomes originate from mobile sequences and ancient retroviruses called
RetroElements (REs). REs consists of tens-of-thousands of nearly identical repetitive copies per RE-family and
have been historically considered “Molecular Parasites” or “Junk DNA” as most are immobilized by mutations
and epigenetic silencing. However, rare instances of gene disruption following RE integration have led to an “US
versus THEM” model that fails to reflect symbiotic relationships developed over millions of years of co-
evolution. This is best demonstrated by the well-known but poorly understood phenomenon of “RE-reactivation”
in mammalian preimplantation embryos, in which thousands of related REs express simultaneously at distinct
stages. REs are essential for development, as their disruption is embryonic lethal. Some REs have maintained
regulatory features that influence expression, structure, and function of nearby genes and RE-signatures tightly
overlap with events that are unique to preimplantation embryos, including zygotic genome activation, totipotency,
reprogramming and pluripotency, supporting the hypothesis that RE-reactivation was perhaps the innovative
catalysts for promoting conserved embryo specific programs through domestication of viral functions and rewired
gene networks. In support, our single cell technologies and preimplantation RNA-Seq analysis to assess RE
function revealed highly conserved expression patterns of RE families across 8 mammalian species. To study
these, we developed an embryo editing technology (CRISPR-EZ) to delete 5 specific RE insertions in mice, each
resulting in unique developmental defects. These findings revealed the first essential retrotransposon in
mammalian development and established reactivation as part of “Normal Development” and shifting our view on
“Junk DNA”. While silenced in most tissues, unintentional RT reactivation is commonly observed (and largely
ignored) during epigenetic breakdown occurring in aging, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, and cancer.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to characterize RE regulatory networks and mechanisms that ensure
proper development and leverage this information to explore the therapeutic potential of “synthetic RE-
reactivation” to re-engage beneficial “emergent properties” in epigenetically compromised cells or block RE-
Signatures in compromised cells to ameliorate or even reverse pathologies. This proposal pioneers a
combination of comparative biology, genome editing and parallel in vivo / in vitro strategies using CRISPR/CAS9
variants and consists of three interconnected but independent aims. We use a human centric criterion to select
RE candidates to 1) characterize conserved RE-mechanisms in development through humanized mouse
models, 2) define RE regulation through a combined in vitro/in vivo CRISPR strategy and 3) assess the
therapeutic potential of RE modulation in adult and diseased cells. Together, our findings will provide an atlas of
REs that have been domesticated by host genomes as a reservoir of genetic innovation and how they can be
further harnessed to study human embryo development and used as a therapeutic tool to improve human health."
