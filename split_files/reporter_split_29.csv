 Air pollution research is increasingly adopting emergent cost-effective technologies to measure pollutant
levels at spatial and temporal scales ﬁner than that delivered by the geographically sparse network of regulatory
monitors. Low-cost air-pollution monitors, while promising, introduce a series of data features like need for ﬁeld
co-location and calibration to eliminate noise, spatio-temporally correlated massive datasets, and repeated mea-
sures on exposures. Current statistical methodology for more traditional air-pollution data collection schemes
are not optimized to properly exploit the noisy, high-throughput, and spatio-temporally dependent low-cost data.
This proposal pursues multi-faceted statistical methods development motivated by the unique features of the
low-cost monitoring data to improve the rigor and widen the breadth of scientiﬁc ﬁndings based on such data.
 Our ﬁrst innovation is a spatial-ﬁltering method for calibration of the noisy low-cost data. Regression calibra-
tion of low-cost networks using ﬁeld co-location with regulatory monitors leads to underestimation of air-pollution
peaks – a critical ﬂaw from a health perspective. The current practice also fails to exploit the spatial correlation
among exposure levels in the network. Our proposed ﬁltering approach mitigates both issues and will be used
to produce network-wide calibrated and smooth high resolution spatio-temporal maps of pollutants.
 Our next set of innovations concern proper utilization of the high-throughput data from low-cost networks.
The large low-cost datasets have increased uptake of data-intensive machine-learning (ML) methods like ran-
dom forests (RF) for exposure prediction modeling. However, exposure data are spatio-temporally correlated
and RF encounters numerous issues for dependent data leading to loss of accuracy. We proposed RF-GLS,
a novel extension of RF that explicitly accounts for spatio-temporal correlation to improve predictions. We will
develop extensions of RF-GLS for use in the spatial-ﬁltering, for predicting categorical exposure data (like Air
Quality Index category), and for estimating exposure effects after accounting for confounders. We will use
RF-GLS for predicting personal exposures using the low-cost ambient and wearable network data in Baltimore.
 We recognize that the rich repeated measures data on exposures from low-cost monitors can be directly
used in association studies between health and air-pollution without any ad-hoc and lossy data reduction like
using the mean exposure. We propose a scalar-on-distribution-analysis (SoDA) that uses the entire sample
of exposures as a distribution-valued covariate in association studies. SoDA is tailored to repeated measures
covariates and will be more efﬁcient than the general-purpose SoFR (scalar-on-function-regression). SoDA will
be used to directly assess which aspects of an individual's exposure distribution correlate most with their health,
which in turn can help re-evaluate and update current air quality standards.
 The statistical methods proposed here will be applied to analyze low-cost ambient and personal exposure
networks in Baltimore. We will also implement the proposed methods in publicly-available user-friendly software."
10740910,"Mechanical stimuli, such as sound, touch, stretch and gravity, activate mechanosensory neurons that mediate
mechanosensory modalities such as hearing, proprioception, touch, and blood pressure regulation. The central
player in mechanosensation is the mechanotransduction channel that detects mechanical forces and
transduces them into electrical outputs. Remarkably, in addition to neurons, many other cell types, such as
those in the bone, muscle, kidney and eye, also respond to various mechanical stimuli. Despite the prevalence
of mechanotransduction channels, few such channels have been identified in mammals. Apparently, novel
types of mechanotransduction channels must be present in mammals but remain to be identified. In particular,
the molecular identity of the mechanotransduction channel mediating hearing in mammals remains obscure
and highly controversial. The development of new strategies and new model systems may facilitate the
identification of novel types of mechanotransduction channels. C. elegans represents a valuable genetic model
for the study of sensory biology. To survive and thrive in the harsh environment, worms have evolved a rich
repertoire of sensory systems that allow them to sense and react to odor, tastant, touch and light, covering four
out of the five primary sensory modalities. More importantly, the genes encoding sensory receptors and
channels tend to be evolutionarily conserved in worms. This, together with its short generation time (~3 days)
and facile genetic tools, makes C. elegans an ideal system for identifying novel sensory receptors and
channels. Nevertheless, worms are considered insensitive to sound. Here, we propose to develop C. elegans
as a new model for studying sound sensation and the underlying neural and genetic mechanisms. To do so,
we will take a multidisciplinary approach combining molecular genetics, behavioral analysis, functional
imaging, and electrophysiology. As sensory receptors and channels tend to be evolutionarily conserved in C.
elegans, the proposed work will provide novel insights into our understanding of sound sensation in mammals.
On a broader perspective, as many cell types are mechanosensitive, yet only a few mechanotransduction
channels have been cloned, the proposed work will also facilitate the identification of novel
mechanotransduction channels mediating other mechanosensory modalities (e.g. touch, proprioception, blood
pressure regulation, etc.) in mammals."

As the prospect for the elimination of COVID-19 in the near future remains uncertain, non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) such as limiting social gatherings, quarantine after exposure to the virus, and school
closure, will continue to play important roles in mitigating the morbidity and mortality associated with the
pandemic. Since these interventions impose immense economic, social, and health-related costs, their use
should be recommended only when epidemic control benefits outweigh their adverse consequences. Our
overall objective in this proposal is to develop an analytical decision tool to optimize the use of NPIs based on
latest information related to the local epidemiology of COVID-19, the effectiveness of different NPIs, and the
population’s stated disutility associated with these interventions. This decision tool is structured to provide a
transparent mechanism to communicate the rationale for the current policy regarding the use of NPIs and the
conditions under which the policy would change. To develop our decision tools, this proposal has three specific
aims: 1) to develop state-level decision models that identify the optimal combination of NPIs, in real-time, and
based on the projected loss in the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the disutility borne by the population
under various combinations of NPIs under various combinations of NPIs; 2) to design, conduct, and analyze
discrete-choice experiments to estimate the disutility weights of different NPIs as borne by population members
due to social, economic, and health consequences of these programs; and 3) to estimate the societal tolerance
for loss in QALYs due to existing infectious diseases without triggering NPIs. This tolerance threshold can be
estimated using historical data related to past pandemic and seasonal influenza and will serve as a benchmark
to decide when the burden of COVID-19 is low enough to lift all NPIs, at least for a short term. The research
proposed in this project is innovative as it develops a novel, principled approach to consolidate real-time data
from three different sources to optimize the use of NPIs: 1) COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths as
projected by existing and new predictive models of COVID-19 pandemic, 2) effectiveness of various NPIs in
breaking the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and 3) disutility weights of NPIs directly elicited from target
populations. The proposed research is significant because it meets the critical needs of policymakers to
identify evidence-based and real-time recommendations regarding the efficient use of NPIs to contain the
burden of COVID-19. The methods and decision tools developed as part of this project could also be used in
responding to other existing and future infectious threats where NPIs are employed."

Chronic pain affects more than one third of the U.S. population, incurring an annual health care cost of
$1 trillion. Some of the most prevalent “idiopathic” pain conditions that frequently co-occur, such as chronic low
back pain (cLBP), temporomandibular disorders, and fibromyalgia, are referred to as Chronic Overlapping Pain
Conditions (COPCs). Among various COPCs, cLBP has the highest prevalence and is one of the top 10 most
disabling conditions worldwide. Unfortunately, having multiple COPCs can further interfere with individuals'
adaptive pain coping and exacerbate pain-related disability. However, much focus to date has been placed on
individual anatomically-based chronic pain conditions and/or one COPC at a time, while little is known about
the mechanisms underlying progression to multiple COPCs. A paradigm shift from anatomy-based approaches
to mechanism-based approaches recognizing common and modifiable risk factors of multiple COPCs is crucial
in developing effective interventions to treat and prevent multiple COPCs. Emerging evidence suggests that
sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances—common clinical features across COPCs—that are modifiable, may
serve an important role in progression to multiple COPCs via enhancement of pain amplification and
psychological distress, which are two critical proximal determinants of multiple COPCs. For the present study,
we propose to recruit a total of 300 participants with cLBP (i.e., 200 with cLBP only vs. 100 with cLBP and
other COPCs) at baseline. Among these, 200 participants with cLBP only will be followed for 12 months. Sleep
and circadian rhythms will be assessed longitudinally (i.e., baseline and 6-month follow-up) using a cutting-
edge wireless EEG sleep monitoring device, 24-hour evaluation of the rhythm of urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
(aMT6s), wrist worn actigraphy, and daily sleep diaries. Pain amplification (measured by quantitative sensory
testing), psychological distress (measured by well-validated self-report measures), and the number of pain
sites (measured by a well-validated pain body map) will be assessed at baseline, and 6- and 12-month follow-
up visits. The proposed study will (1) comprehensively characterize the severity of sleep and circadian
disturbances using ecologically valid multimodal ambulatory assessments among individuals with single and
multiple COPCs; (2) prospectively examine whether baseline and changes (0 to 6 months) in sleep and
circadian disturbances are associated with changes (0 to 6 months) in pain amplification and psychological
distress; and (3) whether pain amplification and psychological distress at 6 months and their changes (6 to 12
months) are related to progression (6 to 12 months) in the number of pain sites (i.e., a valid proxy measure of
multiple COPCs), while controlling for the effects of baseline sleep and circadian disturbances. The findings
from this proposed work will provide novel insights into potential mechanistic pathways underlying progression
to multiple COPCs, which may inform treatment and prevention strategies for these challenging conditions."

 Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are often triggered by environmental stimuli that were
not directly present during trauma, but which nevertheless elicit strong fear responses. Thus, understanding
how fear spreads to non-trauma associated stimuli is paramount to PTSD treatment. Recently, I found that
different contextual memories encoded close in time (i.e., 5 hours) are linked by sharing an overlapping neural
ensemble, making recall of one memory more likely to trigger recall of another memory encoded close in time.
My lab has preliminary evidence that increasing the negative valence of a memory extends the temporal
window of retrospective linking, such that the fear of an aversive context is linked with neutral stimuli
experienced days prior. Linking aversive experiences to past events is ecologically valuable, as the past has
predictive value for the future. However, overlinking traumatic experiences to everyday memories could be
maladaptive and may promote PTSD symptoms. To observe dynamic ensemble activity across long time
scales, I have co-developed a wire-free Miniscope which allows in vivo calcium imaging in untethered, freely
behaving mice. Using the Miniscope, we found that neutral and aversive memories are linked by an increased
overlap in their hippocampal neural ensembles, and that this overlap emerges sometime after learning. We will
therefore test the hypothesis that the enhancement of memory-linking by aversive experience emerges through
co-reactivation of memory representations during an offline consolidation period. We will test the sufficiency and
necessity of ensemble reactivation, as well as synaptic plasticity, in the linking of aversive memories and safe
memories. This work could therefore shed fundamental light on the spread of fear in PTSD and how it might be
clinically targeted."

There is a significant need for clinically trained practitioners with structured research training in environmental
health to translate research findings to clinical and policy realms. The overarching goal of the University of
Washington Pediatric and Reproductive Environmental Health Scholars (UW PREHS) career development
program is to bridge clinical training to research independence, through a mentored research experience in
pediatric and reproductive environmental health. The program integrates the outstanding research and training
opportunities at the University of Washington, forming a novel partnership among the Departments of Pediatrics,
Family Medicine, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Environmental & Occupational Health Sciences, and Epidemiology.
Nationally recognized PREH physicians-scientists and Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU)
leaders, Dr. Catherine Karr and Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, are uniquely suited to lead the program to prepare
future leaders in PREH research and research to policy and practice translation. Our primary aims are to:
1. Recruit and train scholars in PREH science, rigorous research methodology and research skills.
2. Support scholars in completion of an impactful PREH research project.
3. Involve scholars in research translation practice activities through the NW Pediatric Environmental Health
Specialty Unit.
4. Establish and maintain a collaborative network of mentors for scholars to support their success in the UW
PREHS program and in transition to independence upon completion of the program.
Scholars will participate in a tailored career development program anchored in a set of core competencies
spanning four primary domains: 1) PREH content expertise, 2) Research methods development, 3) Practice
based research translation (PEHSU), and 4) Career development toward independence. Central structural
elements include mentor advised individualized learning plans, a novel PREH seminar series, involvement in
PEHSU consultation and outreach, and development and implementation of at least one research project.
Ongoing evaluation plans for scholars, mentors, and the program provides continual improvement for this new
program. A senior Advisory Committee will provide oversight of the program evaluation based on identified
benchmarks. The program is poised to recruit and train up to 6 scholars for 2-3 year periods each. Scholars will
be prepared to serve not only as scientists, but clinician-advocates and trusted and impactful voices on policy
and practices to improve environmental health conditions of children and families."
10912031,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke occurs commonly in older patients and is a leading cause of long-term disability. Disability and death
from stroke can be reduced with timely reperfusion interventions (i.e., intravenous thrombolysis and
endovascular thrombectomy) and high-quality stroke center care. Unfortunately, patients from minority or
underserved populations have less access to reperfusion interventions and acute stroke expertise. This is
largely because stroke centers – the hospitals best equipped to care for stroke patients – are not
geographically distributed to match where patients live and many patients initially present to smaller, non-
stroke center hospitals. Valuable work has been done to improve the capabilities of that first, smaller hospital,
for example through the expansion of telestroke. However, the most effective interventions for stroke will
require transfer. Endovascular thrombectomy is only available at hospitals with advanced capabilities, and
there are significant geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in access to this highly efficacious intervention.
An optimized system of interhospital stroke patient transfers could be a solution to more equitable access to
high-quality stroke care. While many factors contributing to disparities in access and outcomes are relatively
fixed (e.g., patient demographics or hospital locations), the process of interhospital patient transfers is dynamic
and subject to intervention. The decision to transfer, and the timeliness and destination of that transfer decision
can be influenced toward improved outcomes tomorrow. Yet there are many factors influencing patient transfer
decisions. In this mixed-methods study, we use statewide, all-payer claims data to study the network of over
340 California hospitals connected through stroke patient transfer to understand the relationship between
transfer decisions and disparities in patient access and outcomes. We will apply methods from network
science, which are ideally suited to characterize and study the dynamic, multi-level, interdependent structure of
the stroke patient transfer network. We will develop and apply new methods in network community detection to
identify clusters of hospitals closely connected through patient transfer and to study how the racial/ethnic
composition of hospital clusters is associated with stroke-related capabilities in the cluster and how clusters
change over time (Aim 1). We will quantify patient-level racial and ethnic disparities in stroke access and
outcomes and identify factors at the hospital cluster-level associated with disparities (Aim 2). Then, upon
identifying clusters of hospitals that are positive and negative deviants (as outliers in achieving high levels of
access and low disparities), we will use qualitative methods to identify scalable strategies to reduce inequalities
in stroke access and outcomes (Aim 3). We believe that that these solutions will be valuable to health system
leaders and policy makers aiming to ensure better access and outcomes for all stroke patients. On a broader
level, our findings will be applicable to hospital transfer networks across a broad range of conditions, (e.g.,
trauma, acute myocardial infarction) to achieve more equitable access to care and improved patient outcomes."

Our healthcare system does not treat patients equally: some receive poorer quality care based on their racial/
ethnic identity, social class, health literacy, age, gender or medical conditions such as obesity, sickle cell disease,
and substance use disorders. While there may be many factors that contribute to these disparities, implicit bias
among clinicians is one important factor that remains difficult to measure. Clinicians may convey and acquire
bias towards patients from each other when communicating orally or when writing/reading medical records.
Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, few studies have evaluated
patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another. Our own preliminary work has
found that language used in medical records has a direct influence on subsequent clinicians who read the notes,
both in terms of their attitudes towards the patient and their medication prescribing behavior; that there are racial
disparities in the use of stigmatizing language; and that this language reflects actual attitudes held by the
clinicians. This is an important and overlooked pathway by which bias can be passed from one clinician to
another, further impairing healthcare quality for the individual patient as well as exacerbating disparities overall
for those who are stigmatized. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality and equity of care for persons who
are disrespected and stigmatized in healthcare. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to define and develop
a taxonomy of stigmatizing language in medical records using qualitative analyses with input from clinicians and
patients across 5 different medical specialty areas, (2) to measure and test for bias in the use of stigmatizing
language in medical records using natural language processing (NLP) that can efficiently detect and quantify
stigmatizing language in electronic patient records, and then (3) to reduce stigmatizing language in medical
records using proven implementation science (IS) strategies (stakeholder engagement, education, audit and
feedback, and champions) to motivate and enable health system change. Every encounter with a patient is
documented in the medical record. Because language may have a powerful role in influencing subsequent
clinician attitudes and behavior, attention to the language used in medical records could have a large impact on
the promotion of respect and reduction of disparities for stigmatized groups."
10876997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The aim of this proposal is to determine how heterozygous mutation of the chromatin remodeler CHD7
(Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein 7) disrupts development of the neocortex, leading to the
neurodevelopmental anomalies associated with CHARGE syndrome. CHARGE syndrome is characterized by
substantial behavioral and cognitive problems, including executive dysfunction and Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD). The proposed research team recently identified abnormalities in the neocortex of Chd7 heterozygous
mice, implicating CHD7 in key, temporally distinct developmental processes. Preliminary data suggest that
anterior-posterior (A-P) patterning of the neocortex is disrupted in these mice and that CHD7 directly regulates
the expression of a master regulator of A-P patterning, Nr2f1 (COUP-TF1). These mice also exhibit cortical
hypoplasia, implicating Chd7 in cortical growth. Furthermore, excitatory and inhibitory synapses onto deep layer
principal neurons of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are affected by Chd7 haploinsufficiency. Both executive
dysfunction and ASD have been linked to PFC dysfunction. Thus, these findings provide the long-sought
opportunity to identify the mechanisms whereby CHD7 haploinsufficiency disrupts neocortical development.
Chd7 function is context-dependent; hence, a significant focus will be to define sex-, region- and cell-type-specific
functions and mechanisms. This project's specific aims are to 1) test the hypothesis that Chd7 haploinsufficiency
disrupts A-P patterning of the neocortex, 2) define the molecular and cellular functions of Chd7 in neural
stem/progenitor cells of the neocortex and subpallium and 3) test the hypothesis that Chd7 has cell-type-specific
functions in the development of synapses in the PFC. The team will use standard and innovative methods to
visualize and quantify the expression patterns and levels of markers of A-P patterning, and quantify region-, cell-
and sex-specific abnormalities in excitatory and inhibitory neurogenesis. Bulk and single cell next generation
sequencing approaches will be used to identify transcriptional and chromatin changes in different regions and
cell types of the Chd7-deficient developing neocortex in both sexes. The multi-institute team brings together
expertise in neurodevelopmental functions of CHD proteins (Basson), translational and modeling studies of
CHARGE syndrome (Martin), genomics of cortical development (Kwan), and synapse physiology (Andreae).
Together, this work will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of CHD7 haploinsufficiency on
multiple processes in development of the neocortex and identify cell-type-specific functions for CHD7 in neural
progenitor differentiation and PFC circuit assembly. Successful completion of this work will generate the
knowledge and tools necessary to identify the neurodevelopmental mechanisms and circuits that underlie
specific behavioral and cognitive phenotypes associated with CHARGE syndrome and other related disorders."
10920440,"Physical activity (PA) is an important modifiable behavior that has enormous impacts on chronic
cardiopulmonary health. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and heart failure (HF) are similar
systemic syndromes where patients are often deconditioned and suffer exercise intolerance and dyspnea.
Importantly, these patients share a dramatically high risk of sedentary behavior that portend poor outcomes.
While PA is paramount in disease management (with improvements in exercise capacity, quality-of-life, and
hospitalizations) available exercise programs are underutilized and inaccessible, and long-term adherence to
PA is universally problematic. Novel strategies to increase PA in these populations are greatly needed.
 In recent years, there is rapidly emerging interest in use of internet/technology-mediated interventions
to promote health behavior change in chronic disease populations. Our prior work investigated a web-based
PA platform with motivational and educational content coupled with a wearable step tracker with individualized
step goals that demonstrated increases in PA in patients with cardiopulmonary disease in the short term. At the
same time, there is also a growing and robust literature on the benefits of mind-body exercise for health
behavior change. In HF and COPD, we have shown improvements in quality-of-life, exercise capacity, and PA,
with data suggesting that self-efficacy may be an important factor to facilitate long-term behavior change.
 In a previously funded NIH developmental grant (R34AT009354) we leveraged our experience in web-
based PA interventions together with our expertise in mind-body therapies to develop a novel multi-modal
intervention (Mindful Steps) for patients with COPD and HF to foster longer-term PA adherence. Our
theoretical model posits that the integration of a mind-body curriculum enhances key behavioral constructs in
the existing intervention and also targets new areas that will lead to enhanced self-efficacy and increased,
sustained PA. In a pilot study, we have demonstrated study feasibility (recruitment, retention, all-remote data
collection), and intervention feasibility/acceptability (including online, synchronous mind-body classes).
 In this R01, we propose the next step RCT (N=136) to test the efficacy of Mindful Steps, compared to
usual care, to promote PA (objectively measured by daily step counts) in patients with COPD and/or HF
(primary aim). Secondary aims will examine cognitive-behavioral measures within our theoretical model (self-
efficacy for exercise and for disease management, intrinsic motivation, mindfulness, interoceptive awareness)
and patient-centered clinical outcomes (disease-specific quality of life, exercise engagement, dyspnea,
fatigue). Coupling technology with traditional mind-body exercise principles, Mindful Steps emphasizes a whole
person approach that aligns well with NCCIH’s strategic priorities. Based on a compelling rationale and
rigorous feasibility data, a larger-scale remotely-delivered efficacy trial is the next step in evaluating this
accessible, web-based PA intervention that may provide broader reach in COPD and HF."

Many VA patients are susceptible and succumb to infections with the opportunistic
pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can occur as a complication of COPD,
emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer and immunosuppressive drug therapy. Exposure
to this ubiquitous bacterium can result in nosocomial infections, which are common via
respiratory ventilators, catheters, lumbar punctures and general surgery. P. aeruginosa
is highly tolerant or resistant to most antibiotics, making it difficult to control such
infections, which leads to a high rate of morbidity/mortality. The goal of this research is
to improve our understanding of the biosynthesis and regulation of a protective capsule-
like polysaccharide called alginate, which is produced as a virulence factor by P.
aeruginosa. During chronic respiratory infections (e.g., COPD), adaptive mutations are
observed to occur in vivo that lead to the over production of this exopolysaccharide,
which confers a mucoid colony phenotype and resistance to phagocytic killing. This
suggests a high selective pressure for alginate production in the lung environment. Most
of the enzymes for the production of alginate are clustered in the large algD operon. The
mucoid phenotype is usually due to mutations that activate sigma-22. However, we have
discovered an alternate pathway for alginate production that involves a 2-component
regulator pair (AlgB-KinB) and sigma-54 (RpoN). Also, sigma-38 (RpoN) plays an
important role in alginate production, but this is not understood. Improving our
understanding of this pathogenic mechanism in P. aeruginosa will enhance the
management of pulmonary disease caused by this bacterium. In this study, we will: (1)
Determine the role of RpoN (sigma-54) in the control of alginate production, (2)
Determine the role of RpoS (sigma-38) in the control of alginate production and (3)
Identify drugs that enhance the phagocytosis of mucoid Pseudomonas as potential
therapeutic agents. The long-term goal of this research is to better understand alginate
production by P. aeruginosa as a critical virulence factor during pulmonary infection. The
information gained could be vital for the development of new therapeutic approaches in
the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections."
10726601,"Tauopathies are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized pathologically by neuronal loss
and the accumulation of aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein Tau in surviving CNS neurons.
Collectively, these disease, which include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are a common and important cause of
progressive neurological disability in veterans. Current treatments only partially mitigate symptoms and do not
alter the course of these diseases; consequently, there is an urgent need for new approaches that address
pathogenic mechanisms and prevent disease progression. Convergent genetic and pathological evidence strongly
suggests that Tau is centrally involved in causing neurodegeneration in these diseases, and there is accumulating
evidence that microglial activation and pathological microglial synaptic pruning in response to Tau accumulation
plays a key role in pathogenesis. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms regulating aberrant
functions of microglia in tauopathy and whether this could be targeted by novel therapies. During the current
funding period, we discovered that a chemical inhibitor of bromodomains (protein modules that bind acetylated
lysine residues) rescues both neurological function and neuroinflammation in a novel zebrafish tauopathy model.
By using CRISPR/Cas9 to make zebrafish genetic null mutants, we found that the chemical targets a
bromodomain and extraterminal motif-containing (BET) protein, Brd4, which has previously been implicated
in pro-inflammatory signaling. Building on this work, our overall guiding hypothesis is that: Brd4 is necessary
for microglial activation and synapse elimination in tauopathy and is a valid therapeutic target for treatment
of these diseases. To address this hypothesis directly in vivo, we have crossed our novel zebrafish tauopathy
model with a transgenic line expressing a fluorescent reporter protein in its microglia, allowing direct intravital
microscopic imaging of microglial dynamics in the intact brain in vivo (Aim 1A) and recovery of microglia by
flow cytometry for gene expression analysis (Aim 1B). We will determine how microglial functions and
transcriptional programs are altered in tauopathy and by modulation of Brd4. We will further restore Brd4
expression within microglia of Brd4-null zebrafish to establish whether critical functions of Brd4 in tauopathy
are cell-autonomous to microglia (Aim 1C). We will next determine how Brd4 influences neuronal tauopathy,
oxidative stress and synaptic integrity using intravital imaging and biochemical approaches (Aim 2). Finally, we
will test all available bromodomain inhibitors, including some that have already been used in human clinical
trials, for activity in preventing neurological and neuroinflammatory phenotypes in the zebrafish tauopathy
model (Aim 3A). We will take the most promising candidate into a mammalian tauopathy model to test its
translational potential (Aim 3B). Together, these studies will elucidate the role of Brd4 in tauopathy and provide
unique and innovative translational opportunities for development of Brd4-directed therapeutics."
10726602,"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in adult humans including veterans and service personnel.
Stroke promotes significant motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. However, there is no efficacious
therapy to prevent post-stroke brain damage and neurologic deficits. Recent studies showed that modulating
specific microRNAs (miRNAs) leads to neuroprotection and better functional recovery after stroke in rodents.
As the reagents like miRNA mimics and antagomiRs are available to rapidly increase or decrease the levels of
a specific miRNA, they became attractive targets for stroke therapeutic development. In preliminary studies, we
identified that miR-21 levels increase in a sustained manner when cerebral ischemic tolerance was induced in
adult rodents. Preliminary studies also confirmed that miR-21 levels can be increased by >75 fold in mouse
brain without any toxicity using a miR-21 mimic. Treatment with miR-21 mimic induced significant
neuroprotection and motor function recovery in both male and female mice subjected to transient focal
ischemia. In the present proposal, we will rigorously test the therapeutic efficacy of miR-21 in a mouse stroke
model following the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) stipulated criteria.
We will test the hypothesis that miR-21 is a potent neuroprotective miRNA that prevents post-stroke brain
damage. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the efficacy of miR-21 mimic in a mouse transient middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. We will test many STAIR criteria including window of therapeutic efficacy,
long-term motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes, effect of sex, age and diabetes (comorbid condition
for stroke) on miR-21 mimic-induced neuroprotection following transient MCAO.
We further hypothesize that miR-21 mediated post-stroke neuroprotection is due to prevention of gut
microbiome dysbiosis leading to curtailed inflammation.
miR-21 targets several pro-inflammatory genes and treatment with miR-21 mimic suppressed some of those in
post-ischemic brain. This indicates that miR-21 mediated neuroprotection might be in part due to curtailed
post-stroke inflammation. Recent studies showed that gut microbiome influences inflammation in the post-
stroke brain. Curiously, miR-21 is a regulator of the gut microbiome. Hence, in Aim 2, we will evaluate if miR-
21 induced neuroprotection is mediated by preventing gut microbiome dysbiosis.
The overall goal is to establish miR-21 as a neuroprotective miRNA with potential to decrease post-stroke brain
damage and improve functional recovery by rectifying gut dysbiosis and inflammation. If successful, these
studies leads to establishment of miR-21 as a new therapy to help service personnel and veterans who suffer a
stroke.
Relevance of the proposed work to the VA patient care mission: Every year, ~15,000 US veterans suffer a
stroke and many of those who survive struggle with long-term functional deficits. The negative impact of this
devastating condition on veterans is enormous for the families as well as society in terms of financial loss and
quality of life. Successful completion of the proposed studies to identify if miR-21 mimic treatment leads to
better recovery of functions in surviving stroke sufferers will be enormously helpful to veterans."
10931469,"Abstract
This proposal focuses on IDH-mutant gliomas, a leading cause of cancer-related death in people under
45 years old. IDH mutations result in profound distortions in metabolism, chromatin structure and the
epigenetic control of gene expression. The oncogenicity of mutant IDH, together with its ubiquitous
expression across malignant cells in IDH-mutant gliomas make it an attractive therapeutic target.
However, we and others have found that the responses of IDH-mutant cancers to mutant IDH inhibitors
(IDHi) are mixed: some tumors show growth inhibition in the presence of IDHi, while others do not.
Clinically, studies in patients with progressive high-grade gliomas have shown scant signs of activity,
but recent data showed signs of objective tumor responses in subset of patients with low-grade gliomas.
The basis for this differential response in patients and in models is unknown. Our hypothesis, based
on our preliminary data, is that IDHi may act as a differentiation therapy in subsets of glioma
patients by inducing the differentiation of glioma progenitor cells towards mature glial lineages;
we further hypothesize that both intrinsic and extrinsic factors will influence the capacity of
glioma cells to respond to IDHi. To rigorously test our hypotheses, we propose (Aim 1) to perform
single-cell multi-omics analysis in a cohort of IDH-mutant gliomas with and without clinical response to
IDHi. We propose to profile IDHi-treated tumor specimen, and include matched pre- and on-treatment
sample pairs. Leveraging novel human and murine low-grade glioma models, we then suggest to
dissect how mutations associated with glioma progression (Aim 2) and how extrinsic
microenvironmental factors (Aim 3) are affecting the tumor’s response to IDHi. Altogether, this co-PI
R01 research proposal seeks to systematically dissect the neurodevelopmental, genetic and
microenvironmental cues that determine IDH-mutant glioma’s response to IDHi throughout their
progression."

 The goal of this project is to enable the clinical translation of systemically delivered Oncolytic Adenoviruses
(OAds) for combined diagnostic imaging and curative therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a
devastating disease without effective therapies. PDAC has no effective screening methods, and its spread and
metastases are difficult to assess. This new generation of OAds expressing Sodium-Iodide Symporter (OAd5/3-
NIS vectors) developed in the Davydova lab, induces uptake of radioactive iodine by pancreatic cancer cells,
thus facilitating both SPECT/CT imaging and radiotherapy with 131I. We have demonstrated remarkable pre-
clinical data to support the applicability of the OAd5/3-NIS platform to facilitate radioiodine-based imaging and
treatment of PDAC. However, the clinical translation of intravenously administrated OAds has been stalled by
the lack of an animal model that allows OAd replication. Murine tissues do not support replication of human
adenovirus, preventing the use of mice to study biodistribution and off target effects of systemically delivered
OAds. Moreover, all rodent systems lack Adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) receptors necessary to bind to Ad3-based
vectors (including our OAd5/3-NIS). The need for reliable animal models is critical. Less than 5% of anti-cancer
treatments that are promising in murine models are successful in human clinical trials. Therefore, to address this
urgent need, we are developing a novel translational swine model of PDAC. Pigs have been attractive as an
alternative platform for cancer modeling because of their similarity with humans in terms of anatomy, metabolism,
tumorigenesis, genetics, immunity, and body size. Furthermore, as we have recently reported, unlike rodent and
canine models, pigs permit replication of both Adenovirus type 5 and Adenovirus type 3 vectors on the level
similar to that in humans. Validating systemic administration of OAd5/3-NIS in our swine model of pancreatic
cancer is the next step before clinical trials. In this work, we will 1) Produce a novel transgenic
KrasG12D/+/TP53R167H/+ swine model of PDAC; 2) Monitor and characterize PDAC tumor development; and 3)
Conduct the preclinical studies to evaluate the potential of intravenously administrated OAd5/3-NIS to facilitate
both radioiodine-based imaging and radiotherapy with 131I in swine PDAC models. Completion of this proposal
will enable clinical translation of systemically injected OAd5/3-NIS vectors for treatment and diagnostic imaging
of patients with PDAC, including patients with metastatic cancer. Importantly, these studies will generate
essential information on biodistribution, clearance, off target effects, and overall therapeutic potential of other
OAds in a clinically relevant, adenovirus replication permissive, immunocompetent model. In addition, our novel
pig model will overcome many of the disadvantages inherent in rodents, particularly with respect to size, genetics,
cancer biology, metabolism, and immunity leading to translation of safer, more effective cancer treatments for
patients with PDAC, a dismal disease with no effective treatments available.

Malignant brain tumors are aggressive cancers that have high proliferative rates with much higher
energy requirements and high mortality rates. Despite intense clinical and drug development
efforts in the last two decades, there has been no improvement in survival. To support the
abnormal growth commonly seen in tumors, the cancer cells have altered their metabolism
compared to normal cells in healthy tissues. Most of the knowledge to date on cancer metabolism
is derived from cultured cell lines. Probing metabolism in intact tumors will be critical to understand
how the tumor cells grow in a patient under the complex biological tumor environment. From our
pilot study involving a small number of patients, we have demonstrated that gliomas and brain
metastases have the capacity to oxidize acetate in the citric acid cycle to meet their bioenergetic
requirements, and glucose and acetate together contribute up to 63.0% of the total acetyl-CoA
pool in these tumors. The remaining acetyl-CoA that provides carbon sources for biomolecular
synthesis, must be derived from other nutrients. The following are the goals of this proposal: (1)
determine if acetate and ketone body (beta hydroxybutyrate, BHB) utilization is a common
property of all gliomas or specifically linked to high grade GBMs (2) examine whether acetate and
BHB provide carbons for 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) synthesis in IDH mutated glioma patients (3)
preclinical testing of the effects of small molecule inhibitors of acetate and BHB, in freshly resected
tumor tissue slices. We have Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved clinical protocol to infuse
non-toxic and non-radioactive 13C-enriched acetate in patients who will be undergoing surgical
removal of a brain tumor. Using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass
spectrometry of these surgically resected tumor tissues, we will investigate the above described
aims on energy metabolism of primary brain tumors. The attractiveness of this technology is that
no radioactivity is involved. We anticipate that the outcome of this study will generate a detailed
understanding of in vivo utilization of acetate and ketone body in brain tumor patients. This
knowledge will lead to identification of key metabolic targets that may be further exploited for the
development of new therapies. Additionally, it may identify novel biomarkers which may be helpful
in designing non-invasive in vivo MRI methods to track acetate utilization by tumors for diagnostic
purposes."

Melanoma is an aggressive and highly metastatic skin cancer. Although modern combination checkpoint
inhibitors revolutionized clinical outcomes in advanced cases, over half of all patients are refractory to
immunotherapy and require alternative or complementary treatment options. The discovery of ferroptosis
provided a novel way to treat cancer. Recently described vulnerability of melanoma cells to ferroptosis offers
a new therapeutic opportunity, particularly against the malignant cells which are resistant to current therapies.
However, how to exploit such vulnerability is still unclear due to the lack of mechanistic understanding of
ferroptosis regulation in melanoma and the tumor-infiltrating immune cells. We discovered that an
indiscriminate induction of ferroptosis of the entire tumor tissue has a deleterious impact on protective anti-
tumor immune responses, which promotes melanoma progression. Specifically, we found that ferroptotic
death of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC) in tumors is a major mechanism
of immune suppression. Therefore, a shift in the current approach to harness ferroptosis for cancer therapy
is required. Only by understanding the regulatory mechanisms of ferroptosis in different cellular compartments
of the tumor microenvironment (TME) will we be able to engineer effective melanoma therapy based on the
differential modulation of ferroptosis. Utilizing cutting-edge redox lipidomics mass spectrometry and single-
cell lipidomics imaging methods, this project will uncover critical mechanisms of ferroptosis regulation in the
intratumoral PMN-MDSC and melanoma cells. In addition, we will optimize our recently developed therapeutic
approach which will promote ferroptosis of the malignant cells while protecting and enhancing anti-tumor
immunity. To achieve these goals, we will pursue three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will decipher how the
processes of melanogenesis and cell differentiation regulate melanoma cell susceptibility to ferroptosis. The
results will provide a strategic approach to maximizing the efficacy of pro-ferroptotic therapy against
melanoma cells. Aim 2 will focus on identifying mechanisms of ferroptosis-mediated immune regulation by
PMN-MDSC in melanoma TME. The results will reveal how to protect anti-tumor immune responses via
targeted ferroptosis inhibition in the myeloid cells of the TME and prevent immune tolerance to cancer. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will expand on our preliminary data to investigate therapeutic potential of differentially regulating
ferroptosis in the malignant and the myeloid cells of the melanoma TME. This will be accomplished using our
previously developed nano-delivery systems based on graphene quantum nanodots and carbon nanotubes.
Such approach is highly clinically relevant as it employs both cytotoxic and immunomodulatory strategies
against melanoma aimed at reducing immune tolerance to cancer and overcoming modes of cancer
resistance to the standard-of-care combination immune checkpoint and Braf/MEK inhibitors, currently
representing a significant clinical challenge."

Current therapies for patients with heart failure (HF) have limited efficacy because drugs and surgery can only
relieve the symptoms of HF but cannot save necrotic cardiomyocytes. Hence, there is an ongoing need to find
novel treatment strategies for HF following Myocardial Infraction (MI). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
shown to improve cardiac function and reverse remodeling after MI where the underlying mechanism is
multifactorial and recently studies suggested that much of this repair can be attributed to extracellular vesicles
(EVs) that are released by MSCs. Main challenges impeding the translation of EVs into clinical application are
establishing advanced characterization method to document reproducibility and large-scale production for
clinical grade EVs. We have developed large-scale manufacture process using Quantum Bioreactors and this
project will aid in establishing methods to evaluate batch-to-batch variability. Our centralized hypothesis for this
project is that EV restore cardiac function by reducing cardiac remodeling through promotion of tissue
homeostasis, inhibition of inflammation, and promotion of angiogenesis. We hypothesize that repeated, systemic
delivery of WJMSC EVs will have additive impact for improving cardiac function and reducing cardiac remodeling
as compared to single dosing and WJMSC EVs provide underlying molecular mechanisms that is beneficial for
cardiac repair. Our study objectives are: 1) to evaluate the feasibility and safety of repeated injections of WJMSC
EV administered systemically in small animal model; 2) to observe effect on cardiac structure and function in an
experimental MI model; 3) to determine an optimal dose response. The long-term goal is to elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of WJMSC EV cargo on cardiac function and remodeling and the optimal dose and
regimen showing an improvement in cardiac function and reduced remodeling that will be used to investigate
the clinical effectiveness of our established clinical dose of WJMSC EV product in a large animal (porcine) MI
model. We are expecting that at least high dose of EV with repeated systemic administration will show greatest
improvement in cardiac function and seeing similar outcome with the medium and lower dose of EV. This would
coincide with absorption of EV into the heart tissue observed at 24 hours after administration and accompany of
finding key molecular mechanism of improving cardiac repair from RNA bioinformatic analysis. In addition, we
will be able to establish characterization criteria to reduce donor-to-donor variability. The positive outcome of this
study will establish the premise for moving toward large animal MI model and translating the technology and
innovation for clinical application."

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) provide the sole source of visual information to the brain and form the building
blocks for all downstream vision. In primates, considerable progress has been made in characterizing the three
most common RGC types, which make up 80% of the retinal output, and much less is known about the remaining
15+ rarer RGC types. A key barrier to progress has been the difficulty of targeting these rare RGCs in acute
experiments. These challenges have been overcome with an approach for visualizing the structure and function
of foveal RGCs in the living macaque eye by combining calcium imaging, retrograde tracers and fluorescence
adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (FAOSLO). FAOSLO imaging is non-invasive and enables study
of the same RGC populations for months or years. This technique has enabled in vivo classification of foveal
RGCs to identify the elusive rarer types. This proposal aims to extend the capabilities of FAOSLO imaging to
directly test the roles of these rare RGCs in vision while establishing the foundation for an independent research
career. Aim One will implement high-speed scanning strategies and voltage indicators to read the retinal code
in the living eye and achieve the temporal resolution necessary to study rare motion-sensitive RGCs. Aim Two
will directly test the hypothesis that the rare ON direction selective RGC type contributes to optokinetic eye
movements in primates using targeted laser lesions of individual RGCs. Aim Three will establish a paradigm to
isolate rare RGCs and the visual functions they mediate through transneuronal retrograde degeneration following
V1 lesions. This line of investigation will also clarify the timeline of RGC loss and the underlying physiological
changes that occur in RGCs following V1 damage in strokes. The research goals of this proposal are reinforced
by a comprehensive training plan that will provide the new skills and knowledge necessary to achieve the
candidate’s research goal of establishing the links between rare primate RGCs and visual functions. The
candidate will carry out the mentored phase with Dr. David Williams, a pioneer in the use of adaptive optics for
imaging the eye. Co-mentor Dr. Bill Merigan will contribute expertise in behavioral experiments, lesions and viral
vectors. Additional training from a first-rate advisory committee (Drs. Krystel Huxlin, Tony Movshon and Jesse
Schallek) will put the candidate on a strong pathway to independence. Together, the research and training
proposed will facilitate the candidate’s successful transition to a tenure-track faculty position at a research-
intensive university."
10738792,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and debilitating neuropsychiatric consequence of
military combat, representing a significant burden for many Veterans. PTSD is also a highly heterogeneous
disorder, with symptoms varying from patient to patient—complicating clinical decision-making. The
diversity in symptom presentation has led to a growing interest in developing a biologically-grounded
framework for neuropsychiatric disorders, where the focus is on symptoms, not diagnostic categories, and
where symptoms are a consequence of dysfunctional neural circuits. Symptom-derived biomarkers can then
guide precision medicine approaches by identifying the underlying symptom-specific neural circuits that are
most sensitive to specific treatments. Yet, much of what we know about the circuit pathology associated with
PTSD comes from comparing diagnostic groups on a single mechanism using a single neuroimaging measure.
These univariate neuroimaging approaches precludes identification of the more complex relationship
between neural mechanisms and PTSD symptoms. This complexity underscores the need for an integrated
and multivariate approach to probe multiple neural circuit mechanisms underlying specific PTSD symptoms.
 The current proposal aims to address this gap by measuring the combined contribution of two critical
mechanisms of PTSD: 1) the ‘top-down’ cognitive control over working memory (WM) storage, and 2)
‘bottom-up’ inhibition of fear responses during fear extinction recall. First, we posit that misallocating WM
resources to task-irrelevant threat may help partially explain the trauma-related intrusive memories, and
inability to extinguish fear responses that are characteristic of individuals with PTSD. To investigate this,
Veterans (N=85) that have experienced a criterion-A trauma and have mild to severe levels of PTSD
symptoms will complete separate measures including an affective WM task and a fear extinction recall
paradigm while undergoing fMRI. The first goal of the project will be to use fMRI to test our hypothesis that
Veterans with elevated PTSD symptoms unnecessarily maintain threat-distracters in WM and consequently
diminishing WM capacity. The second goal will be to identify the common neural circuit underlying WM
control and fear extinction recall. The primary goal of the study will be to test the hypothesis that the neural
integration between WM and fear extinction recall dysfunction predicts PTSD symptom clusters. To
investigate this last goal, we will use an innovative multivariate neuroimaging analytic strategy called
multimodal neuroimaging fusion. Multimodal fusion analysis allows for the identification of unique and high-
dimensional neural patterns among multiple neural measures and PTSD symptoms that a univariate
approach would miss. This project will be one of the first studies to apply a multimodal neuroimaging fusion
analysis in a Veteran PTSD population. Results from this project will lay the groundwork for establishing and
validating the multimodal approach to develop biomarkers of PTSD symptom heterogeneity within cognitive
and extinction-based mechanisms, two mechanisms that are clearly integral to current PTSD treatments.
 Building upon the applicant’s prior experience with neural measures of WM dysfunction in anxiety, the
proposed training plan provides an opportunity for new hands-on training in fear learning methodology,
multimodal neuroimaging, and advanced multivariate neuroimaging analysis to meet the immediate goal of
developing skills in these domains. This dovetails with the long term career goal for the candidate of
developing of expertise in the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities for the purpose of enhancing
clinical utility of neuroimaging for PTSD diagnostic assessment and treatment prediction. Data from this
project will provide critical and direct pilot data for successful preparation of a VA Merit Award. Together, the
research and training plan will make the applicant well-positioned to transition to an independent clinical
researcher within the VA system."
10738728,"The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading cause of death due to diarrheal disease in young
children, particularly in the context of malnutrition, milder infections often result in growth faltering. The
incidence of cryptosporidiosis drops off sharply after the age of two in areas of high transmission, yet in
regions with low transmission adults remain susceptible, as demonstrated by frequent outbreaks in the U.S.
More than 50% of waterborne disease in the U.S. is caused by this parasite which is resistant to water
chlorination and considered a category B potential bioterrorism agent. The epidemiology in children
suggests that initial infection results in long lived protective immunity, a phenomenon also observed in the
context of veterinary cryptosporidiosis. Harnessing this immunity into a vaccine could prevent the disease
and dramatically impact child mortality and development. However, there are significant gaps in our
knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie immunity to Cryptosporidium. We developed a new natural
model of Cryptosporidium infection in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice that mirrors important aspects of
human cryptosporidiosis and in which host and parasite are genetically tractable. This proposal assembles
an interdisciplinary team of experienced parasite molecular biologist and immunologist to define how the
infected enterocyte senses infection, how it responds to and restricts infection, and how it interacts with
dendritic cells and T cells to trigger and execute a protective immune response. This research will impact
our fundamental understanding of immunity in the gut and drive translation towards prevention of an
important contributor of child mortality.

10738731,"Considered one of the most urgent microbial threats by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
estimates of the excess costs of C. difficile infection (CDI) to the healthcare system range from $897 million to
over $4 billion. Our long-term goal is to develop tools to identify patients at risk for CDI that could reduce its
incidence, decrease transmission, improve patient outcomes, and reduce healthcare expenditures. We have
developed and validated an algorithm using the electronic health record (EHR) to identify patients at high risk
for CDI several days in advance of their diagnosis. However, there is a gap in knowledge as to whether real-
world data-driven risk models can improve outcomes by guiding interventions in a clinical setting.
To fill this gap in knowledge and improve CDI prevention efforts in hospitals, we propose the following specific
aims: 1) to prospectively deploy an institution-specific daily risk prediction model for CDI and
assess how elevated risk relates to colonization with C. difficile; 2a) to conduct a quality improvement study
assessing a hospital-wide intervention bundle that incorporates patient risk for CDI; and 2b) to identify
heterogeneous intervention effects across different subgroups (e.g., colonized versus not colonized; specific
ribotypes) and secondary outcomes (e.g., reduced severity/complications). We will apply our model to daily
extracts of EHR data, collect discarded rectal swabs and stool after standard clinical testing is completed to
determine colonization status / ribotypes, and assess our model with respect to colonization status, potentially
incorporating it to further improve the model. Using rates of hospital-acquired CDI, we will also assess the
impact of a hospital-wide, risk-based prevention bundle rolled out for each ward in stepped-wedge, cluster-
randomized fashion. The bundle will include both infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship
components. This project’s successful completion would provide a model for improving the prevention of CDI
and other healthcare associated infections in hospitals and health centers."
10738735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lysosomes are small, membrane-bound organelles that participate in numerous critical processes
including macromolecular degradation, secretion, membrane repair, signaling, nutrient sensing and cellular
metabolism. Central to lysosomal function is its acidic lumen, which can reach pH values as low as 4.5. The
low pH activates degradative enzymes that break down proteins, damaged organelles and other
macromolecules into building blocks that can be recycled for cellular use. In neurons, defects in lysosomal
function can lead to accumulation of potentially cytotoxic macromolecules such as ab, a-synuclein, tau and
others. Consequently, lysosomal dysregulation is associated with numerous human diseases, including many
neurodegenerative diseases. In this application, we propose experiments that will elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of two lysosomal ion transport proteins, TMEM175 and CLC-7, whose mutation can lead to
defects in lysosomal homeostasis and are associated with disease in humans and mice.
 TMEM175 is a lysosomal K+ channel that was identified in as a highly potent risk-factor for the
development of Parkinson’s Disease. In cells, TMEM175 establishes a membrane potential between the
lysosomal lumen and the cytosol and is critical for lysosomal and cellular homeostasis. Loss of TMEM175
leads to dysregulation of lysosomal pH, deficiencies in autophagy and mitophagy and an increased
susceptibility to cytotoxic stress. Despite its importance in Parkinson’s Disease and cellular homeostasis, both
the molecular details of TMEM175 function and its physiological roles are only starting to be understood. We
recently determined cryo-EM structures of TMEM175 in open and closed states that demonstrated that
TMEM175 is structurally unrelated to other K+ channels. Moreover, the structure confirmed that its gating,
permeation and selectivity mechanisms are distinct from those characterized for other K+ channels. Through a
combination of biophysical, biochemical and structural analyses, we will determine the permeation, gating and
selectivity mechanisms underlying TMEM175 function and gain insights into how its mutation can lead to
lysosome dysfunction and disease.
 CLC-7 is a member of the CLC family of Cl- channels and Cl-/H+ exchangers that requires a b-subunit,
OSTM1, to function in lysosomes and the ruffled border of osteoclasts. CLC-7 is a lysosomal Cl-/H+ exchanger
whose mutation can lead osteopetrosis, lysosomal storage disease and developmental delay. Notably, several
of the mutations associated with associated with disease in humans result in changes in gating. While studies
of prokaryotic and eukaryotic CLC proteins have established a framework for the transport cycles, the gating of
CLCs is poorly understood at the molecular level. Using structural and electrophysiological approaches, we will
elucidate mechanisms by which pH and ligands regulate the gating of CLC-7. These studies will serve as a
foundation for better understanding the role of CLC-7/OSTM1 in lysosomal physiology."
10726614,"Significance: Diabetes is a global epidemic with 48 million people affected in USA, and the prevalence is
expected to increase to 63 million by 2045. The disease represents a significant public health problem. Diabetes
within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) poses a significant challenge because the estimated
prevalence of diabetes among its enrolled patients is as high as 25%, substantially higher than the general
population. Diabetes is the third most common VHA diagnosis and accounted for 25% of pharmacy costs and
over 1.7 million hospital bed days. Diabetic retinopathy, a microvascular complication of diabetes is the leading
cause of vision loss in middle-aged adults. Despite the use of therapeutics targeting the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), about two thirds of patients do not recover vision, and the effect is transient, needing
repeated intravitreal injections of drugs. Rationale: Chronic inflammation in retina plays a major role in BRB
alteration resulting in vascular leakage. Our preliminary work presents novel evidence that there is increased
influx of monocytes and activation of microglia in the retina in diabetes. The goal of this research proposal is to
determine what factors are secreted by the activated microglia and how those factors interact with vascular
cells leading to alteration of the BRB. Hypothesis: Activated microglia in the diabetic retina secrete
factors that affect pericyte-endothelial interactions leading to BRB alteration. Aims: 1)
Determine effect of microglia depletion on the retinal vasculature and structure in the context of diabetic
retinopathy, 2a) Identify and prioritize “candidate genes” by analyzing the core transcriptional signatures of
activated retinal microglia in an animal model of diabetes in relationship to blood-retinal barrier alteration.
2b) Validate the role of “microglial candidate genes” on endothelial cell permeability and blood retinal
barrier alteration in diabetes and 3) Test the druggability of the functionally validated candidate genes
using an off-patent small molecule library in cell culture models and a diabetic animal model. Design: In
this research proposal, next generation sequence (NGS) technology will be utilized to investigate the molecular
basis of alteration of the BRB in diabetes. This research will address a critical scientific gap by identifying
molecular mediators beyond VEGF that alter the BRB. Relevance: The findings may help in development of
novel biomarkers and improved therapeutic strategies targeting these molecules in both type 1 and 2 diabetes
patients that may prevent vision loss in those who poorly respond to anti-VEGF drugs. Our approach is
innovative because this proposal introduces an innovative strategy that targets the mechanisms of stabilizing
the initial step of microglia dysfunction in diabetes, a critical upstream event for the development of diabetic
macular edema."
10902007,"Abstract
Advances in non-invasive monitoring of human brain function under normal and pathological conditions will lead
to breakthroughs in our understanding of the brain in health and disease, and lead to the development of devices
available for everyday use, with applications such as monitoring patients with brain injuries or neurodegenerative
disease, studies of brain function in natural environments, and brain-computer interfaces. Among the various
brain imaging techniques, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an optical method that images the
hemodynamic response to brain activation by measuring the oxy-(HbO) and deoxy-(HbR) hemoglobin
concentration changes due to brain activation. It is especially useful for populations and for studies for which
other imaging modalities are limited, e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), including for children,
infants, and studies that involve motion and interactions or require high temporal resolution. However, fNIRS
brain sensitivity in adult humans is typically around 10%, and fNIRS alone does not provide quantitative
information about all the hemodynamic parameters as it does not measure changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF).
Here, we propose to develop a fiber-based speckle contrast optical spectroscopy (SCOS) system to measure
CBF variations due to brain activation in humans. SCOS uses relatively low-cost complementary metal–oxide–
semiconductor (CMOS) cameras as detectors. The performance of SCOS can surpass that of existing optical
systems for human measurements of CBF in terms of contrast to noise ratio (CNR) by at least one order of
magnitude with equal or less cost. The combined SCOS-fNIRS system developed in the UG3 phase will provide
measurements of all the hemodynamic parameters associated with brain activation, achieve an up to 3x
improvement in brain sensitivity compared with fNIRS alone, and permit estimation of evoked changes in
CMRO2. The high-density SCOS-fNIRS system developed in the UH3 phase will provide images of all the
hemodynamic parameters with high spatial and temporal resolution. This work will result in a new approach for
functional brain imaging and demonstrative results that will motivate adoption by others and future advancements
towards wearable devices at a reduced cost."
10908717,"Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses. Over the last two decades, coronaviruses have led to severe respiratory infections in humans. Most recently, SARS-CoV-2 led to a global pandemic and resulted in more than 6.5 million deaths globally since December 2019. We currently lack a sufficiently broad set of antiviral drugs targeting different aspects of coronavirus replication. Therefore, developing new antiviral drugs targeting currently untargeted aspects of coronavirus replication may help reduce the mortality of future coronavirus infections. As such, it is critical to understand the molecular mechanisms of many different aspects of coronavirus replication as this will help to determine which aspects of viral replication may be useful targets for the development of new antiviral drugs. One aspect of coronavirus replication that is not well understood is the mechanisms by which coronaviruses remodel host cell membranes. Once coronaviruses infect host cells, a set of nonstructural proteins (nsps) are produced from the viral RNA. Three of these nsps, nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6, are integral membrane proteins that remodel host cell membranes to generate double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These DMVs serve as the assembly sites for the replication and transcription complexes that are critical to producing viral RNA. In addition, DMVs have been shown to contain viral RNA further highlighting the critical role of DMVs in viral RNA production. While it is clear that membrane remodeling by coronaviruses is essential for their replication, we currently lack an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which coronaviruses remodel host cell membranes to generate DMVs. One major reason for our limited understanding of this process, is that no studies have investigated the structure and function of the membrane-spanning regions of nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 using purified proteins. As such, we will purify nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 for structural studies using cryo-EM and for biochemical investigations using model membranes including liposomes and giant unilamellar vesicles. Importantly, this will work will not only provide new insight into the mechanisms of coronavirus replication, but it will also help reveal if membrane remodeling by coronaviruses may be a useful target for the development of future antiviral drugs."
10894918,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Treatment-seeking insomnia sufferers most often present in primary care where their first and usually only
treatment is a prescription hypnotic medication. More than 65% of individuals prescribed hypnotics use them for
more than a year, and more than 30% remain on them for more than five years. Such agents may be useful for
acute insomnia and certain cases with chronic sleep difficulties, but prolonged hypnotic use can lead to
dependency and increased morbidity (e.g., falls, cognitive/driving impairments). Reducing or discontinuing
hypnotics after prolonged use is a challenging task for both prescribing physicians and the patients who use
them. Although evidenced-based physician-supervised medication tapering (SMT) protocols have shown
efficacy, such interventions have yet to be disseminated widely in primary care. Most primary care providers
(PCPs) are willing to refer their insomnia patients to alternative evidence-based non-drug treatments such as
cognitive behavioral insomnia therapy (CBTI), but such treatment is often difficult to access outside of specialty
sleep centers. Given this gap between research and clinical practice, there is a pressing need to develop and
validate cost-effective interventions to facilitate the management of insomnia and hypnotic tapering in primary
care. In response to PAR-20-183, This application has been carefully designed to address these issues. We
will conduct a large randomized trial to compare the combined digital CBT (dCBTI)/SMT intervention, to the
SMT intervention delivered alone for producing hypnotic discontinuation and insomnia symptom improvement.
A sample of 430 hypnotic-reliant patients drawn from 8-10 primary care clinics within a practice-based research
network affiliated with the University of Colorado Medical School in Aurora, Colorado will serve as study
participants. The main objective of the project is to compare the performance of dCBTI+SMT with SMT used
alone for achieving hypnotic reduction/discontinuation and insomnia symptom improvement. In addition, we
will incorporate an Effectiveness-Implementation assessment into the RCT to identify patient- provider- and
system-level factors that may impact adoption, implementation and maintenance of the types of interventions
tested. Findings from the effectiveness/implementation should help design future trials of implementation
strategies identified herein to promote dissemination of dCBTI and SMT interventions into primary care should
these treatments prove effective in the current trial. We also will gather exploratory data to determine who
responds best to dCBTI/SMT. This study will provide new and useful information about the feasibility, clinical
utility, and patient-, provider-, and system-level acceptability of these interventions to manage insomnia and
reduce/eliminate hypnotic use in primary care. This project should serve as a necessary first step toward the
eventual dissemination of accessible, cost-effective strategies to manage a significant public health problem and
improve the quality of life of millions of chronic users of controlled-substance sleep aids."
10923937,"Project Summary
Rotator cuff tears are a significant clinical problem, resulting in 30% of all visits to orthopaedic surgeons and over
150,000 surgical procedures per year. Rotator cuff tears occur frequently in the middle-to-late aged population
and can cause severe pain, disability and activity limitations. Exercise therapy is typically prescribed for initial
treatment of rotator cuff tears and is often effective at relieving symptoms. However, exercise therapy fails to
relieve symptoms in 25-50% of cases, requiring surgical intervention. Thus, we conducted a prospective
observational cohort study of 109 individuals with a symptomatic isolated supraspinatus tendon tear who
underwent a personalized exercise therapy program (POETT Cohort). In addition to a much lower incidence of
surgery (6.4%) at 2-year follow-up, our exercise therapy program led to significant improvements in passive
glenohumeral range of motion, isometric muscle strength, patient-reported outcomes, and in-vivo
arthrokinematics without increases in rotator cuff tear size. Initial computational modeling efforts using subject-
specific inputs demonstrate that individuals who underwent surgery have less stable glenohumeral joints after
exercise therapy. Due to the lower incidence of surgery in the POETT Cohort and the aforementioned findings,
we seek to determine the mechanistic and clinical factors that could be associated with the improved outcomes.
Therefore, the overall objective of our project is to determine the long-term viability of exercise therapy
for treatment of individuals with rotator cuff tears using our unique POETT Cohort by assessing
important biomechanical and clinical parameters. The project will address three specific aims: Aim 1)
Determine durability of an exercise therapy program to provide clinicians with information related to factors
associated with the success or failure of exercise therapy. Changes in PROs at 3-, 4-, and 5-years; rotator cuff
tear size at 5-years; in-vivo glenohumeral kinematics at 5-years and subsequent surgery following exercise
therapy will be collected; Aim 2) Assess the relative magnitude of improvements in arthrokinematics over 5-
years for the POETT Cohort with respect to healthy control subjects; Aim 3) Assess restoration and maintenance
of glenohumeral joint stability in subjects with a rotator cuff tear that undergo exercise therapy. Changes in the
magnitude and direction of the glenohumeral joint reaction force will be determined for those that were
successfully treated with exercise therapy compared to those that underwent subsequent surgery and control
subjects utilizing musculoskeletal models. We hypothesize that exercise therapy maintains the health of the
rotator cuff over a period of 5-years and joint function will be similar to age-, sex- and hand dominance frequency
matched individuals. These analyses will allow for continued development of individualized treatment protocols
through determination of the durability of exercise therapy long-term and comparisons to controls and those who
underwent subsequent surgery. Restoration of shoulder function for those with a rotator cuff tear is essential for
maintaining a healthy, active lifestyle, particularly in our aging population."

Lyme Disease (LD) is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States. While more
than 80% of the LD cases can be effectively treated using established antibiotic treatments, 10-15% of patients
develop post-treatment, long-term sequalae manifested as fatigue, cognitive impairment, joint pain, and other
symptoms and termed Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS) causing patients to experience
substantial loss in quality of life and resulting in a marked financial burden on both patient and health care
system. The absence of approved molecular diagnostic tests leads many physicians to dismiss the notion of
PTLDS entirely, leaving patients with few or poorly defined treatment options. While currently no approved
treatment for PTLDS exists, emerging evidence suggests substantially better clinical outcomes from early
intervention with targeted therapies in a number of chronic and autoimmune disorders. Early risk assessment
of developing PTLDS offers a window of opportunity by alerting both the patient and the physician to anticipate
a long-term symptomatic result and adjust symptom-based treatment. The proposed study focuses on the
urgent need to identify immunologic biomarkers for predicting the risk of a patient developing PTLDS early
during the acute phase of the disease and has the potential to markedly improve clinical outcomes through
early intervention. The proposed approach derives disease-specific antigen information from a comprehensive
binding profile of the patient’s circulating antibody repertoire. The novelty of the approach is in representing an
entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire, instead of simply focusing on a priori known
antigenic targets. The approach relies on using machine learning models trained on the antibody binding
profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 unique peptides with an average length of 9-10 amino acids as a
sparse representation of all possible combinatorial 9-mer sequences. Predictive models are then used to
identify disease-associated pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that can be combined into a potential
panel for PTLDS risk assessment. It is hypothesized that B. burg. antigens and/or self-antibodies from the
human proteome are involved and that there is a set that can be used as biomarkers to predict progression to
PTLDS early in the disease. The antibody response over time will be profiled in a set of longitudinally collected
patient samples as they progress from confirmed acute LD, through treatment to disease outcome. This
approach applied will enable the breadth of the antibody response, including a potential response/cross-
reactivity to human proteins to be examined along with the heterogeneity of antibody responses across a
cohort of patients. In silico predictions of protein antigenicity will be confirmed using solution-based
immunoassays. The proposed work is expected to identify a set of B. burg. and potentially human autoimmune
antigens that are associated with progression to PTLDS. Such knowledge is expected to serve as the basis for
future diagnostics, therapeutics or in the generation of hypothesis that can be tested in disease models."
10739286,"Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression is crucial throughout life for maturation of postmitotic
neuronal function and preservation of brain health. Although continuously expressed neuronal transcription
factors termed terminal selectors, such as Pet1 and Lxm1b, are key regulators of gene expression across fetal
and postnatal stages of life the underlying molecular mechanisms through which they control stage specific
neuronal gene expression are poorly understood. Here, we aim to fill this gap by comprehensively investigating
terminal selector function in postmitotic serotonin (5-HT) neurons. Pet1 and Lmx1b’s control of serotonergic
gene expression is of broad interest as 5-HT has wide-ranging modulatory effects on central neural circuitry
and altered serotonergic gene expression has been implicated in several developmental neuropsychiatric
disorders including depression, stress-related anxiety, autism, OCD, and schizophrenia. The studies proposed
here are motivated, in part, by our discovery of changing dependencies of continuously expressed 5-HT
neuron terminal effector genes on Pet1 as 5-HT neurons mature. We unexpectedly found that Pet1’s terminal
selector control of 5-HT synthesis genes is largely switched off in the early postnatal period and instead Pet1
switches to controlling the upregulation of neurotransmitter GPCR genes, Htr1a, Adra1b, that are needed for
afferent synaptic modulation of 5-HT neuron excitability. These recent observations have led us to suggest a
new principle that we have termed “terminal selector target switching”. We suggest that as postmitotic neurons
progress through life, continuous terminal selector regulated transcription is not static, as is the prevailing
assumption. Instead, we hypothesize that terminal selector regulated transcription is highly dynamic in which
regulatory factor interactions with target genes are remodeled as postmitotic neurons mature. We hypothesize
the remodeling of regulatory interactions is rooted in the temporal remodeling of postmitotic neuronal chromatin
architecture. In Aim 1, we will investigate Lmx1b’s control of early postnatal 5-HT gene expression to
determine whether postmitotic target switching is a general property of 5-HT terminal selectors. In Aim 2, we
will use our newly developed 5HT-ATAC-seq protocol to uncover the temporal dynamics of 5-HT open
chromatin as 5-HT neurons develop and mature from fetal to early postnatal stages of life. Specifically, we will
address these questions: Do open chromatin states undergo maturational changes in parallel with the
maturation of 5-HT neuron transcriptomes? Do switches in target dependence result from gene specific
changes in open chromatin? Aim 3 will investigate a plausible potential mechanism through which developing
5-HT gene expression patterns are controlled: Terminal selectors, Pet1 and Lmx1b, directly act to control the
maturation of 5-HT neuronal open chromatin states. Understanding how terminal selectors control postmitotic
neuronal gene expression may illuminate potential neurodevelopmental disease mechanisms that cause
aberrant neuronal gene expression and defects in neuronal maturation."
10863884,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prescription and illicit opioid use have risen to a public health crisis, with the landscape shifting to fentanyl use.
Given that fentanyl is 100-fold more potent than morphine, its use is associated with a higher risk of fatal
overdose. Naloxone (Narcan) reverses opioid overdose and precipitates withdrawal. However, recent reports
indicate that xylazine, an anesthetic that is increasingly detected in accidental fentanyl overdose deaths, has
become a highly sought-after adulterant that can prolong both the fentanyl “high” and the onset of fentanyl
withdrawal, as well as precipitate resistance to naloxone in the reversal of overdose. Despite this, no systematic
studies to date have evaluated the neurobehavioral mechanistic contributors to these effects. While opioid
pharmacological mechanisms of action have been studied, it is not clear how the addition of xylazine to fentanyl
inhibits the actions of naloxone, as either alone does not have this action. Excitingly, we have possibly discovered
the mechanisms of how xylazine combined with fentanyl causes resistance to naloxone using our State-of-the-
Art PamGene PamStation technology that measures hundreds of kinase activities in a single sample. We show
preliminary data for the signaling pathways in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore) that are hyper- or hypo-
active, which gives us numerous potential targets for reversing naloxone resistance and xylazine’s effects on
fentanyl self-administration (SA). We hypothesize that the xylazine-fentanyl combination activates non-
canonical pathways that reduce consumption and prolong the onset of fentanyl withdrawal signs. Our objective
here is to uncover these unknown mechanisms using our PamGene technology and determine how these impact
neurocircuitry and behavior. Therefore, we will test these in our following Aims: 1) Determine how xylazine
impacts the effects of fentanyl, 2) Determine viable therapeutic targets to resensitize fentanyl withdrawal
following the escalation of xylazine-fentanyl SA, and 3) Determine neural circuits altering the NAcore and ventral
tegmental area (VTA) kinomes following the escalation of xylazine-fentanyl SA and if these underlie naloxone
resistance. We will map the active kinome of the NAcore and VTA following xylazine-fentanyl co-use and will
test novel treatment targets that we find are changed via our extensive analysis. We will further test if these
neural circuits contribute to co-use-induced alterations in targets that we have identified from our PamGene
analysis, and thus we will determine if suppressing these circuits may enhance the actions of naloxone and
restore neural targets altered by xylazine-fentanyl co-use (measured via kinome analysis). Together, these
hypothesis-driven studies will markedly enhance our understanding of the neurobehavioral mechanisms
underlying xylazine-fentanyl polysubstance use and withdrawal and will likely reveal novel treatment strategies
for reversing the xylazine-fentanyl-induced naloxone inefficacy."

Lung cellular resistance against microbes requires a signaling network involving stroma and innate myeloid
and lymphoid cells. To date, the signaling receptors and pathways are incompletely understood. Signaling
Lymphocyte Molecule Family (SLAMF) receptors are widely expressed among hematopoietic cells and lung
epithelial cells making them ideal candidates to orchestrate phagocyte killing of microbes. We recently reported
that during pulmonary infection with the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis (Bd), SLAMF1 is required for innate
immunity and dispensable for priming vaccine-induced CD4+ Tcells. In preliminary data, we found that
SLAMF1 is required for killing of the yeast by neutrophils and monocytes in vivo, but the receptor is dispensible
for killing in vitro. These findings suggest that extrinsic, SLAMF1 dependent signals activate phagocytes to kill
yeast in vivo.
In this application, we propose to elucidate where and how SLAMF1 receptors endow phagocytes with the
ability to kill yeast in vivo during pulmonary fungal infection. We hypothesize that innate lymphocytes and
CCR2+ monocytes are required for SLAMF1-mediated neutrophil activation. We also posit that SLAMF1
mediates its function through homophilic (SLAMF1:SLAMF1) interactions between innate lymphocytes
and monocytes or through direct sensing of the yeast by SLAMF1. We provide strong preliminary data to
support our hypotheses. By using a panel of antibodies directed against 17 pulmonary leukocyte populations,
we found SLAMF1 staining on CD4+TCR+, TCR+, MAIT cells and Ly6Chi CCR2+ monocytes at 16 hours
post-infection. Our workplan in Aim 1 offers approaches that will elucidate the requirement of SLAMF1 on
lymphoid, myeloid or stromal cells for activation of neutrophil killing of yeast. In Aim 2, we will define the mode
of SLAMF1 action by distinguishing between SLAMF1 homophilic interactions among cells that express the
receptor vs. direct sensing of yeast by SLAMF1. Our work will identify new mechanisms of receptor-mediated
activation of innate effector cells and lay the groundwork for subsequent studies to advance detailed
mechanistic insight into how SLAMF1 orchestrates signaling and activation of neutrophils, as these cells are
the most potent effector to combat fungal and other microbial pathogens. This knowledge will provide the basis
for developing and designing new strategies for therapeutic treatments against fungi, and other pathogenic
microbes that require innate immunity for pathogen restraint."

K99 training: The goal of the proposed K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to provide Dr. Jonas
Dora with training needed to launch his career as an independent scientist. Following his PhD in cognitive
psychology, Dr. Dora has already started to make important contributions to the field of alcohol use research
as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Washington. The
proposed K99 training period builds on Dr. Dora’s PhD background and his current training in the study of
alcohol use in natural environments. The K99 phase will provide a period of intensive training in the combined
study of alcohol use with experimental, ecological momentary assessment, and computational approaches,
and will position Dr. Dora to make substantial contributions to the field of alcohol research over the course of
his career. Dr. Dora will learn from the proposed mentor (Dr. Kevin King), local collaborators (Drs. William
George, Mary Larimer) and external collaborators (Drs. Matt Field, James Murphy, Katie Witkiewitz), who are
leading experts in the field of alcohol use research using both experimental and ecologically valid approaches,
as well as the advanced computational modeling of behavioral and subjective data. In addition, Dr. Dora will
attend courses, scientific conferences, and workshops to meet his training objectives. The University of
Washington is a world-class research institution that provides an optimal environment, the necessary
resources, and a stimulating intellectual space to facilitate successful completion of this project.
K99 research: Together with his mentor and collaborators, Dr. Dora will conduct controlled experiments in a
simulated bar environment as well as studies in people’s natural drinking environment to test the idea that
negative and positive reinforcement of alcohol can be observed when heavy drinkers with and without
symptoms of alcohol use disorder (AUD) make decisions between alcohol and substance-free reinforcers.
R00 research: Dr. Dora will translate the K99 research using a task involving hypothetical choices between
alcohol and substance-free reinforcers into an ecologically valid test of the hypothesis that positive and
negative affect differentially motivate real-world value-based decisions to consume alcohol (vs regulate affect
via alternative emotion regulation strategies) in heavy drinkers with/without symptoms of AUD in everyday life.
Significance: By combining methods from cognitive psychology and alcohol use research, this research will
provide a novel test of the idea that alcohol use is reinforcing in the face of positive and negative emotions, and
in that way will advance NIAAA’s strategic aim to identify mechanisms that contribute to AUD. By studying
alcohol use as a form of value-based decision-making, the insights from this project will suggest new
possibilities to target people’s emotions in the prevention and treatment of alcohol use disorder."
10741446,"Severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) is the most severe form of the alcoholic liver diseases (ALD) caused by acute
and chronic alcohol abuse. ALD is associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia, viral infections (e.g.,
HIV and HCV), and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Current therapies are largely ineffective – 40% of
patients do not respond to corticosteroid therapy with high resultant short term mortality. Therefore, the
development of novel targeted therapies will be dependent on delineating the molecular mechanisms of SAH.
Studies in the past thirty years in both humans and animal models have revealed that acute and chronic alcohol
consumption cause leaky gut via inflammation, gut microbiome dysbiosis, tight junction disruption, decreased
mucus and antimicrobial peptides. The advance of bacterial 16S rRNA revealed that in alcoholics with dysbiosis
Bacteroidacea have been found to be decreased while Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were increased. It is
now clear that a gut-liver axis is causatively linked to progression of alcohol-induced liver disease. Our long-term
goal is to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop novel therapy for intervention and prevention of SAH.
During the current funding period, the Zhu and Sun groups discovered a massive deposition of antibodies in
SAH livers, and that these antibodies exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy, while the corresponding serum
antibodies did not. We further showed that antibodies from SAH livers cross-react with both human and E. coli
proteins. Finally, large amounts of B and plasma cells are found infiltrating SAH livers. Based on these results
and the literature, we hypothesize that B and plasma cells infiltrated in SAH livers produce anti-gut bacteria
antibodies that can cross-react with human proteins and cause liver damage. Identification of the origin of gut
bacteria that elicit the cross-reacting antibodies in SAH is a crucial step towards understanding the etiology of
SAH. Equally important is to isolate the B and plasma cells infiltrated in SAH livers and characterize their roles in
liver damage. The goal of this proposal is to determine the origins of these cross-reacting antibodies in SAH and
characterize their function and contribution to liver damage. To test our hypothesis, we propose three Specific
Aims: 1) Identify gut bacteria that elicit cross-reactive antibodies specific in patients with SAH; 2) Determine
cross-reactive antibody signatures in patients with SAH; and 3) Characterize B/plasma cells infiltrated in SAH
livers that produce cross-reactive antibodies. The success of this project will allow us to further elucidate the
molecular mechanism of the gut-liver axis in liver injury."
10854978,"The sympathetic nervous system is a key regulator of whole body physiology. A
dysfunctional sympathetic nervous system is linked to a growing list of human disorders
including chronic heart failure, hypertension, and insulin resistance. Despite decades of
research on sympathetic neurons, satellite glia, the major glial cells in sympathetic ganglia,
have remained an enigmatic component of the system. Satellite glia tightly ensheathe
sympathetic neuron cell bodies. In recent work, we revealed a role for satellite glial cells
in restricting neuron activity to thereby modulate sympathetic output to peripheral organs.
Our findings suggest that sympathetic neurons and their surrounding satellite glia should
be considered as structural and functional units that orchestrate the formation and
functioning of the sympathetic nervous system. However, satellite glia are a vastly under-
studied cell type in the nervous system, with limited understanding of their development,
neuron-glia communication, and how they contribute to neural circuits.
 This application addresses this knowledge gap by seeking to define how
sympathetic neuron-satellite glia units are established during development, and how
perturbations in this process impact neuronal connectivity and function. Based on our
preliminary results, we hypothesize that target-derived neurotrophin signaling in
sympathetic neurons instructs contact-based interactions with neighboring satellite glia
during development. The goal of this application is to test this hypothesis and define the
molecular underpinnings of this bi-directional neuron-satellite glia interactions using
genetic mouse models, neuron-glia co-cultures, biochemistry, and imaging. Our studies
will establish a fundamental knowledge of how these poorly studied glial cells contribute
to nervous system connectivity and function and will inform new strategies for treating
disorders linked to sympathetic dysfunction."
10933500,"Project Summary / Abstract
Virtually all U.S. adults will develop multimorbidity (coexistence of multiple chronic conditions) by late
adulthood. The sequelae are substantial: vulnerability to acute illness, disease exacerbation, hospitalization,
disability, poor health-related quality of life, and mortality. Despite this, there are no viable, patient-centered
measures for multimorbidity in the electronic health record (EHR) that include a comprehensive inventory of
conditions based on their impacts on physical functioning in community-dwelling adults and are thus broadly
applicable for the general population. The absence of such tools impedes systematic efforts to develop
effective interventions for patients with multimorbidity. To bridge these gaps, this proposal aims to develop and
validate a robust, clinically relevant, readily-available EHR-based multimorbidity-weighted index (eMWI) that
accurately ascertains disease presence using EHR data and is applicable for diverse populations across the
lifespan. The central hypothesis is that a comprehensive multimorbidity index that weights conditions based on
their impacts on physical functioning can more precisely quantify multimorbidity and provide a better model fit
to predict key health outcomes than prior measures. This hypothesis is strongly supported by our preliminary
results using large national surveys and survey-linked claims data, in which we rigorously developed and
validated a comprehensive set of 91 chronic conditions weighted by their average impacts on physical
functioning over the disease life course, thus incorporating illness burden and physical functioning into a
clinically meaningful measure applicable for the general population. As a transformative step for multimorbidity
measurement in patient care, population health, and research using EHR data, the team aims to 1) improve
multimorbidity measurement by more accurately ascertaining disease cases, and merging these with validated
physical functioning disease weights to create a new patient-centered eMWI applicable to diverse populations;
2) assess the validity of eMWI via its association with key clinical outcomes: multimorbidity progression,
hospitalization, and mortality; and 3) test the applicability of eMWI to national population health and policy by
applying it to evaluate the risk of severe and fatal COVID-19 among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated adults based
on their multimorbidity. This study uses large, diverse EHR data from 6 California health systems (>6 million
adults) with unique data linkages to census data, and the largest, most nationally-representative National
COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) dataset (>5 million COVID cases). The results will yield a new, validated,
patient-centered multimorbidity index for EHR data – the eMWI – to help guide clinical decisions, population-
health management, policy, and research for diverse populations. The team anticipates that eMWI can directly
impact future practice and outcomes in which multimorbidity and functional status impact everyday treatment
decisions and outcomes. eMWI will be readily available in standardized code for other EHR data. Overall,
these results will improve the quality of care and health outcomes for diverse, aging adults with multimorbidity."

1) Objectives: We will define associations and pathways through which exposure to PM2.5 and metals
contribute to dementia-associated neuropathology (DAN), incident dementia, and cognitive function. We will do
so by leveraging resources from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, an ongoing, prospective cohort
study of brain aging and dementia in older adults who are cognitively intact at enrollment. Every two years
since 1994, ACT has collected vetted data on dementia, other brain health measures, physical health, lifestyle,
medications, and residential history for over 5000 participants, following them until incident dementia or death.
At each timepoint, ACT assesses dementia using the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) and
consensus diagnosis using DSM-IV criteria. AD is also assessed based on NINCDS criteria. For participants
who consent to autopsy (~25%), ACT performs a neuropathological examination of their brains, including
confirmation of dementia diagnoses. Our study will build on these data and resources to achieve 3 primary
aims: (1) to characterize PM2.5 and metal concentrations within the olfactory bulb (OB), olfactory tract (OT), and
brain tissues of ~140 human donors to establish whether the OB is a pathway through which air pollutants
reach the brain; (2) to investigate the OB as a pathway for DAN within the OBs and brains of these donors; and
(3) to assess the association of PM2.5, metals with incident dementia - including for pathologically-defined AD,
μVBI, LBD, and mixed dementia – and cognitive function, controlling for key confounders and examining effect
modification by sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economics, and health conditions and mediation by health conditions.
2) Approach: We will test our aims following a multi-disciplinary approach that relies on (1) our detailed
analysis of brains and OB for particles, metals and DAN indicators for ACT participants who consented to
autopsy and (2) our epidemiological analyses of the association of long-term ambient PM2.5 and metal
exposures with incident dementia, AD, μVBI, and LBD for the entire ACT cohort and for the subset with
neuropathology confirmed dementia diagnoses. For both, we will leverage ACT’s rich database of clinical and
functional health measures, behaviors, and residential histories. We, for example, will use the residential
histories to estimate long-term ambient PM2.5 and associated metal exposures for each ACT participant using
novel spatio-temporal models. We will also use health and behavioral data to control for key confounders and
predictors and health data to assess modification and mediation of the pollutant-dementia associations.
3) Expected Results: We will provide new evidence of the risks posed by airborne metals to incident dementia
and of the pathways through which airborne metals cause damage. In so doing, results from our study will help
identify targeted interventions to block pathways to dementia by type and mitigate the severe and growing
burden of AD and other dementias."
10732769,"Activating mutations in Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) are seen in
approximately 5-10% percent of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that independently confers a poor
prognosis, and is the leukemic driver in 35% of patients with the rare chemoresistant juvenile myelomonocytic
leukemia (JMML). To date, targeting PTPN11 for clinical benefit has not been well established. Our
preliminary data using high-throughput functional assays have identified that PTPN11 activity is dependent on
an upstream tyrosine kinase, TNK2, and that leukemic cells with activating PTPN11 mutants are sensitive to
TNK2 inhibition. The long-term goal of this proposal is to identify novel combinations of targeted
therapies using PTPN11/TNK2 dependent leukemias as a model. The immediate goals are to
comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of PTPN11 activation, and to define
therapeutic regimens for treatment based on the central hypothesis that PTPN11-dependent leukemias
are directly activated by TNK2. To accomplish these goals, several key AIMS will need to be addressed: 1)
Develop a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways interacting with activated PTPN11. We will
use molecular and biochemical studies to dissect the interactions of proteins within PTPN11/TNK2 and
downstream pathways through heterologous model systems, PTPN11 mutant AML cell lines, murine bone
marrow cells with mutant PTPTN11, and primary mutant PTPN11 AML samples. Further, RNAi and
CRISPR technology will be utilized to selectively inhibit expression of candidate proteins to identify
critical interactions necessary for PTPN11/TNK2 activity within hematopoietic model systems. These studies
will establish the molecular and biochemical foundation necessary for defining PTPN11/TNK2 activation, and
help guide novel targeted approaches. 2) Test combination pathway inhibition to overcome escape from
monotherapy. We will use our experience and expertise with small molecule inhibitors to identify synergistic
combinations of inhibitors to TNK2, PTPN11, modulators of PTPN11/TNK2 activation, and downstream
effectors in vitro using cell lines and primary patient samples. Molecular and biochemical studies will be
performed on samples that overcome therapy to identify escape mechanisms. These studies will define the use
of combination therapy for treatment of PTPN11-driven leukemias and provide critical pre-clinical data for
further development of these combinations. 3) Test combination therapies in the animal model. We will test the
above combinations in vivo using mouse models harboring PTPN11 mutations, as well as primary patient
leukemia samples with PTPN11 mutations xenografted into immunodeficient mice. These studies will build the
preclinical foundation for combination of targeted therapies for eventual use in patients with PTPN11-driven
leukemias."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the few malignancies with such poor outcomes that it meets the definition
of a “recalcitrant” cancer, accounting for 30,000 American lives each year with five-year survival rates of just
~7%. Somewhat lost in these dismal statistics is the fact that patients diagnosed early (limited stage) display
vastly superior survival metrics when compared to those diagnosed late (extensive stage). Unfortunately, only a
minority of cases are identified at limited stage, and the computed tomography (CT) screening approaches
capable of early detection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not proven effective for SCLC. We will
employ a novel two-mode, array based, hybrid plasma marker methodology capable of detecting autoantibody-
autoantigen complex and unbound autoantibody markers for SCLC early detection. One of the major problems
with studying SCLC is there are few studies and cohorts that have appropriate plasma samples. We have
accumulated robust biomarker candidates centered around autoantibody-antigen complexes using the
Cardiovascular Health Study (prediagnostic), Fred Hutch Lung Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Clinic,
and Vanderbilt SCLC sample sets and will comprehensively define free autoantibodies levels in these same
cohorts. We propose to test a fixed combination rule combining both autoantibody approaches using all of the
prediagnostic SCLC samples from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian
Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO), and the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) cohorts and diagnostic samples
from Moffitt Cancer Center. Using prediagnostic samples allows us to effectively model early detection much
more accurately than after diagnosis occurs, and this is particularly important for SCLC as diagnosis at the
extensive stage is nearly almost always fatal. Part of our analysis will determine how early our autoantibody
marker panel can predict the presence of SCLC and whether a tumor can be observed via CT at that time in
order to evaluate the timing and implementation of our early-detection procedure."

KSHV is associated with Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman’s disease. KSHV-associated disease occurs more commonly in immunocompromised individuals, indicating an intricate relationship between disease progression and the host immune system. It is well established that cell intrinsic immune sensors, and in particular the DNA sensors Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), sense KSHV infection. However, it is less clear whether RNA sensors, such as the RIG-I like receptors RIG-I and MDA5, participate in host defense against KSHV. Data within this proposal demonstrate that RIG-I and MDA5 impose a significant restriction on KSHV lytic reactivation in PEL. Using high- throughput transcriptomics we have defined the RNAs that are recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 during KSHV lytic infection in PEL, and this proposal builds upon our observations. These studies will enable us to (Aim 1) determine the contribution of RLR-associated RNAs to KSHV restriction, (Aim 2) determine how KSHV-encoded proteins impact RIG-I and MDA5 sensing, and (Aim 3) identify the precise mechanism of MDA5 activation during KSHV infection. Completion of these studies will provide fundamental knowledge regarding how the cell intrinsic immune response is activated during KSHV infection."

This application seeks to plan and develop a research training program at the University of Cape town (UCT)
that will focus on understanding basic mechanisms underlying bacterial disease in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Bacterial infectious diseases (excluding mTB) are a huge public health problem in SSA as infections caused
by bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus pneumonia, are major causes of
mortality. The impact of these pathogens is compounded by widespread antimicrobial resistance (AMR),
vaccines against these pathogens developed outside of SSA being less effective at preventing serious illness
and increasing pathogen virulence. Combined these limit treatment options of these recognized pathogens
and promote emergence of new bacterial causes of mortality (e.g. Klebsiella pneumonia). While
microbiological and clinical research groups in South Africa contribute significantly to global understanding
of these diseases, these groups do not significantly complement this work with complementary mechanistic
in vivo studies. Thus, an urgent need exists to develop advanced regional training in undertaking such in vivo
research into bacterial pathogenesis and host immunity. The objective of our proposed training program is to
fill this gap by leveraging existing strengths and unique resources both at UCT and at our overseas partners
at the University of California Davis (UCD) to develop a research training program. UCT is home to a world
class animal facility that is underutilized by researchers studying non-mTB bacterial infections. UCD has
unique resources that support animal modelling including the #1 ranked Veterinary School globally, the
California National Primate Research Center, the internationally renowned Mouse Biology Program, and a
T32 supported predoctoral program focussed on Animal models of Infectious Diseases. Thus unique
expertise exists at UCD that will be invaluable in supporting the UCT program. We propose a 2-year planning
process that will develop an advanced training platform in in vivo studies of non-mTB bacterial infection in
SSA which we will submit as a competitive proposal for a D43 Global Infectious Disease Research Training
program. Project leaders at UCT and UCD have already identified existing overlapping research strengths
that will benefit from in vivo disease modelling at UCT. D71 supported symposia and researcher exchanges
between UCT and UCD will support the key interactions enabling realization of a competitive and deliverable
D43 program. The planning of this program will also require implementation of ethically approved SOPs,
acquisition of permits to allow transfer of state-of-the-art research reagents to UCT, as well as development
of a new research training program for junior investigators and fellows. The final submission of a competitive
D43 program grant will present a program that will enable high impact mechanistic bacterial infection biology
studies at UCT. The research that emanates from this will accelerate regional and global control of
devastating human bacterial infectious diseases."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and around half of MDD patients
have treatment-resistant depression. The use and clinical benefit of rTMS have escalated greatly in recent years.
As only 40-50% of patients respond to current standard rTMS, there is great interest in predicting which patients
are likely to respond, what brain features best predict response, and how these features relate to the core
biosignatures of MDD. To address this, and responding to NIH’s call for Precision Medicine approaches, our
Global Deep Learning Initiative to Understand Outcomes in Major Depression unites international leaders in
MDD and rTMS research, neuroimaging, and AI to identify generalizable predictors of rTMS response, and
assess how they relate to brain biomarkers of MDD. Two major innovations are proposed. First, we use novel
deep learning methods, based on convolutional neural networks, to extract predictive features from multimodal
brain images (sMRI, DTI, and rsfMRI); tactics applied in whole-brain and surface-based mapping of brain function
and structure, DVAEs for feature extraction, and transfer learning (to learn from auxiliary datasets and tasks) will
distill predictive features while protecting individual privacy. CNNs trained on multimodal brain maps for our
predictive tasks will distill additional layers of information that have not yet been fully exploited in MDD research,
to better predict clinical status and treatment response. Second, our worldwide ENIGMA-MDD network will
provide diverse test data from globally representative populations, to ensure that our predictive models do not
break down when tested on diverse data. ENIGMA’s harmonized extraction of brain measures across worldwide
cohorts will enhance rigor and ensure that analyses are well-powered and consistently performed. We include
an important partnership with REST-meta-MDD, a Chinese consortium collecting multimodal imaging data from
patients with MDD, to test the generalizability of our predictive models. The likely outcome of our work is a set
of pre-screening tools to predict who will respond best to rTMS, and a deeper understanding of the brain
signatures of MDD that predict treatment outcomes following rTMS. All tools will be made public via NITRC and
ENIGMA websites, and will be tested across our ENIGMA network, guaranteeing impact of the work for large-
scale outcome prediction within and outside of MDD research."
10867425,"Project Summary
We have established the existence of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responsive and caspase 2
(Casp2) dependent pathway that leads to activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 and 2
(SREBP1/2), the master regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. The Casp2-dependent
pathway operates independently of SREBP cleavage activation protein (SCAP), the major activator of
canonical SREBP signaling and the target for its feedback inhibition and negative regulation by sterols and
other lipids. SCAP-dependent SREBP signaling is activated when sterol concentrations are low and during
hepatic insulin resistance and may account for simple steatosis (NAFL), the benign form of non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Conversely, the Casp2-dependent pathway is activated during hepatocyte ER
stress and leads to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the aggressive form of NAFLD, characterized by
liver damage and inflammation, and at advanced stages by loss of liver fat. Importantly, we discovered
that the two pathways are engaged in negative crosstalk, such that SCAP-dependent SREBP activation
attenuates ER stress, likely via ER membrane expansion, whereas activation of the Casp2-dependent
pathway by the ER stress sensor and transducer IRE1 is associated with induction of INSIG2, an inhibitor
of SCAP-dependent SREBP activation. Moreover, inhibition of SCAP-dependent SREBP signaling
potentiates ER stress, which enhances IRE1 activation, resulting in elevated expression of INSIG2, Casp2
and PIDD1, a component of the PIDDosome complex, which includes Casp2 and the scaffold protein
RAIDD. In addition to Casp2 activation, PIDD1 may target the PIDDosome complex to the ER membrane,
thereby enabling cleavage of site 1 protease (S1P) by Casp2, the first step in the non-canonical SREBP
activation pathway. We postulate that the mutually exclusive interactions between the two pathways
contribute to the sharp transition from simple steatosis to NASH. We will test this hypothesis in three
specific aims. 1. Test the hypothesis that elevated IRE1 activity, Casp2 activation and inhibition of SCAP-
dependent SREBP activation control human NASH progression, using an extensive collection of NAFLD
biopsies available at UCSD and a novel human liver spheroid model of NAFLD/NASH. 2. Test the
hypothesis that INSIG2 induction inhibits SCAP-dependent SREBP activation and potentiates the Casp2-
dependent pathway by enhancing ER stress and IRE1 activation. These studies will be conducted in
mouse models and will deploy state-of-the-art high-content spatial transcriptomics. 3. Determine the role
of IRE1 and its downstream effectors in NAFL to NASH progression in mouse models and human
spheroids, and the suitability of these mediators to therapeutic targeting. Impact: these studies will shed
new light on the mechanistic basis for Casp2-dependent SREBP activation and the role of ER stress, IRE1
and its effectors in NASH pathogenesis, laying the foundation to new therapeutic interventions."
10886813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, over one-third of older adults ≥60 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) die without receiving any
chemotherapy, primarily due to concerns of cognitive decline and loss of functional independence if they chose
to undergo intensive chemotherapy. A combination of venetoclax and low-intensity chemotherapy offers an
effective new treatment for AML. However, several knowledge gaps exist about this new approach. Venetoclax
targets neuroprotective B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) proteins, but the actual risk of cognitive decline and loss of
functional independence following its use, and the factors that increase such risks, are still unclear. Our
preliminary data demonstrated that many older adults with AML had stable or improved cognitive and physical
function, functional independence, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from the time of diagnosis to three
months following newer treatments. These novel findings highlight the success of newer treatments in improving
cognitive function, functional independence, and HRQOL. Despite this, frailty and multimorbidity were identified
as risk factors for functional decline. We also utilized the NCI-recommended neuroscience approach and
conducted electroencephalography (EEG)/event-related brain potential (ERP) studies. In our study, adults with
hematological cancers versus healthy adults demonstrated altered activity in the dorsal attention and central
executive brain networks prior to treatment. Confirmation of these findings will identify the risk of a decline in
attention and executive function, functional independence, and HRQOL, and will provide novel mechanistic
insights into the activity of brain networks in older adults with AML. In the proposed longitudinal cohort study, we
will enroll older adults with a new diagnosis of AML who will receive venetoclax-based treatments, and age-,
sex-, and education-matched non-cancer controls. We will compare the two groups on the following outcomes:
attention and executive function (Trail Making and other neuropsychological tests), functional independence,
HRQOL, and EEG/ERP measures (ERP studies during auditory-visual distraction tasks to measure brain activity)
at enrollment and over 12 months. The study aims are: Aim 1. Determine the longitudinal attention and executive
function of older adults with AML before and after venetoclax-based treatment, as compared to age-, sex-, and
education-matched non-cancer controls. Aim 2. Determine longitudinal changes in functional independence and
HRQOL in older adults with AML versus controls, and examine their associations with longitudinal changes in
attention and executive function. Aim 3. Measure longitudinal changes in the activity of brain networks of older
adults with AML before and after venetoclax-based treatment, as compared to controls. This is the first study to
apply rigorous methods to overcome key limitations of prior studies and to advance the current limited cognitive
aging research in patients with AML. Understanding factors associated with stable/improved functional trajectory
following new treatment can change treatment paradigms and is essential to inform critical decision-making of
older adults with AML considering chemotherapy for this fatal disease. The goals align with the NCI/NIA priorities."

Enzymes have important implications for understanding many human diseases as well as for developing new
medicines and therapies. Design of small molecule drugs without side-effects targeting enzymes and designer
enzymes as biotherapeutics are widely pursued in the pharmaceutical industry. However, these endeavors are
hindered, among other aspects, by the lack of fundamental understanding of enzyme function including the
factors that enable enzymes to achieve high catalytic efficiencies. For more than a century, an immense wealth
of information has been accumulated based on experimental and computational investigations. Collectively,
the biochemical model of enzyme catalysis has revealed the vital roles of active-site residues and other
secondary structure elements. However, clear understanding of the roles of: (1) the functionally important
conformational sub-states (or rare intermediates); (2) the distal regions including the conserved residues and
surface loops; and (3) the surrounding solvent, in enzyme catalysis still remain elusive. For close to two
decades, Agarwal lab has been working on using joint computational-experimental approaches for obtaining
answers to several important questions about enzymes. Investigations of >20 different enzyme systems have
enabled us to contribute to building a biophysical model of enzyme catalysis, which is improving our knowledge
of these highly efficient molecular machines. We have discovered conserved network of residues linking
surface loop regions to the active-site in several medically important enzyme systems, and successfully
developed and validated quasi-anharmonic analysis (QAA) method for identification of conformational sub-
states. In this proposal, we describe computational investigations of several enzymes including human
ribonucleases, dihydrofolate reductase and biliverdin reductase. Using previously developed and new
approaches, the following key questions will be answered: (1) What roles do conformational sub-states play in
enzyme catalysis? Specifically, functionally important higher energy sub-states and their linkage to kinetics of
the rate-limiting step in enzyme cycle will be quantitatively characterized; (2) Energy flow within preferential
pathways (or network channels) formed by conserved residues will be characterized as the biophysical
mechanism for long-distance coupling; (3) Thermodynamical coupling between the surrounding environment
(solvent) and the enzyme structure and catalyzed reaction will be characterized. A combination of molecular
dynamics (MD) and new theoretical analysis methods will be used. We have and continue to work with a
number of experimental laboratories to validate our models and their outputs. Experimental data from NMR,
enzyme kinetics, X-ray and other techniques on wild type and mutant versions of enzyme systems will be used
to iteratively refine our models. These investigations will provide new insights into mechanism of long-distance
effects and insights into factors that contribute to the catalytic efficiency of enzymes. The developed software
will continue to be made available to the community and we will support a wide variety of labs in their
investigations of enzymes. Over long-term these efforts will lead to designing of better allosteric modulators
and designer enzymes for biotherapies."
10886803,"ABSTRACT
Over the past two decades, the prognosis for glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal brain tumor, has remained
dismal, with a median survival of only 12-16 months from diagnosis. We recently demonstrated that GBM cells
acquire large amounts of fatty acids (FAs) and cholesterol by dramatically upregulating their de novo synthesis
and uptake for rapid tumor growth. However, excess FAs and cholesterol can alter membrane dynamics and
function, leading to cellular damage. How GBM cells avoid this lipotoxicity to sustain proper lipid levels in different
cellular compartments, particularly in the mitochondria, is poorly understood. During the past 5 years of funding,
we have made great progress in understanding how GBM controls FA homeostasis. We demonstrated that GBM
cells upregulate diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), allowing them to store abundant FAs as
triacylglycerol-containing lipid droplets (LDs) to prevent excess FA accumulation to induce toxicity. In this
renewal proposal, we will address two unanswered critical questions: 1) how is cholesterol homeostasis
regulated in GBM cells? and 2) can effective therapeutic approaches be developed for GBM by disrupting lipid
homeostasis? We recently found that cholesteryl esters (CEs), which form LDs to store excess cellular
cholesterol, are largely present in GBM tissues, and blocking CE synthesis results in dramatic mitochondrial
fragmentation in GBM cells. Moreover, our preliminary data showed that cholesterol is transferred from CE-
containing LDs (CE-LDs) to the plasma membrane, while inhibition of autophagy blocks this transfer. These data
suggest that CE-LDs maintain proper cellular cholesterol levels via autophagy. Our preliminary data further
showed that stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), which has been shown to prevent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress and ferroptosis, is upregulated upon DGAT1 inhibition. Finally, preliminary data showed that the
expression of multiple antioxidant genes is significantly elevated in response to DGAT1 inhibition. These results
strongly suggest that GBM cells can activate defense mechanisms to alleviate the lipotoxicity triggered by
disruption of FA storage, possibly leading to tumor resistance to DGAT1 inhibition. Thus, we hypothesize that
CE-LDs serve as critical reservoirs for controlling cholesterol homeostasis and mitochondrial function, and that
combining disruption of storage or redistribution of cholesterol with interference with mitochondrial cholesterol
import, or disruption of FA storage with either inhibition of SCD1 or blockade of antioxidant pathways are effective
strategies for targeting GBM. In Aim 1, we will examine the impact of inhibiting cholesterol storage or
redistribution from CE-LDs on cholesterol homeostasis and mitochondrial function, and whether such blockade
can synergize with interfering in cholesterol import into mitochondria to efficiently kill tumor cells in GBM
xenograft models. In Aim 2, we will examine whether inhibiting SCD1 or antioxidant pathways can strongly
synergize with DGAT1 inhibition to effectively inhibit GBM growth in vitro and in vivo. Successful completion of
this study will provide strong pre-clinical data on potential novel strategies to target GBM."
10851833,"Metabolic liver disease, encompassing nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with insulin resistance as the pathophysiological hallmark, is an emerging issue affecting one in four adults in the U.S. Obesity is characterized by inflammation in the liver, and surrounding macrophages and cytokines may play a major role in metabolic liver disease. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanism by which obesity causes metabolic liver disease by delineating the role of macrophages and cytokines as a molecular link between insulin resistance, NAFL, and NASH. Interferon-γ (IFNγ), a key regulator of innate and adaptive immunity by priming macrophages, is elevated in obese humans. Our preliminary data indicate that mice with conditional loss of IFNγ signaling in myeloid cells (Lyz-IFNgR2 KO) develop fatty liver after a high-fat diet but are protected from insulin resistance and inflammation in the liver. Moreover, interleukin-12 (IL-12) plays a major role in bridging innate and adaptive immunity by inducing differentiation of Th1 cells, and IL-12 levels are elevated in obese humans and NASH liver. We made a novel observation that IL-12 treatment in vivo causes hepatic insulin resistance by impairing IRS-1 activity in the liver. We also found that IL-12 modulates IRS-2/FoxO1/FGF21 expression in hepatocytes, that may lead to the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibrogenesis during NAFL progression to NASH. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that obesity-mediated activation of IFNγ signaling in macrophages, through the release of IL-12, causes metabolic liver disease. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of the IFNg-IL12 axis in obesity-mediated insulin resistance in the liver. Metabolic, molecular, and cell-based experiments will be performed in newly created mice with Kupffer cell-selective loss of IFNγ signaling (Clec4f-IFNgR2 KO). We will also apply chronic and liver-targeted IL-12 treatment using AAV8 and mice lacking IL-12 genetically or via liver-selective IL-12 targeting siRNA using GeRPs to test a hypothesis that IL-12 activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase impairs insulin signaling activity and causes insulin resistance in the liver. Aim 2 will delineate the role of the IFNg-IL12 axis in regulating intercellular crosstalk between macrophages, hepatocytes, and HSCs during NAFL progression to NASH. We will examine the effects of the obesogenic Gubra Amylin NASH diet on liver steatosis and fibrosis in Clec4f-IFNgR2 KO, Lyz-IFNgR2 KO, and mice with gain/loss-of-function of IL-12 using 3D-ultrasound and histology. Kupffer cells, hepatocytes, and HSCs will be isolated from the liver for molecular and cell-based experiments to test a hypothesis that IL-12 modulates hepatocyte IRS-2/FoxO1/FGF21 pathway, leading to HSC activation and fibrogenesis. Taken together, these aims will introduce a novel paradigm in which IFNγ signaling and IL-12 act as key mediators of intercellular crosstalk between macrophages, hepatocytes, and HSCs in hepatic insulin resistance and during NAFL progression to NASH in obesity. Our findings will identify IFNγ signaling and IL-12 as potential therapeutic targets to treat metabolic liver disease in humans."
10881808,"Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is marbled within skeletal muscle and appears to play a key role in the
obesity-induced risk of type 2 diabetes. What is not known is how IMAT promotes decreased muscle insulin
sensitivity. There is a critical need to understand how IMAT contributes to the risk of obesity-induced diabetes,
and how to intervene to minimize IMAT-induced muscle metabolic dysfunction. The overall objective for this
project is to determine the impact of weight loss on IMAT secretion of fibronectin and inflammatory cytokines
and eicosanoids. Our central hypothesis is that IMAT secretion of fibronectin promotes muscle insulin
resistance, and IMAT secretion of inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids causes muscle inflammation, both
of which are diminished by weight loss. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that clarifying the
extent to which weight loss alters the IMAT secretome will inform development of interventions to modify IMAT
and improve muscle insulin sensitivity in obese individuals. We propose two specific aims: Specific Aim 1.
Evaluate the impact of weight loss on IMAT secretion of fibronectin and the role of fibronectin in the IMAT
secretome to decrease insulin sensitivity in vitro. Preliminary data inform our working hypothesis that IMAT
secretes fibronectin that decreases muscle insulin sensitivity and is attenuated after weight loss in humans. In
vitro experiments will measure the extent to which IMAT fibronectin secretion explains IMAT-induced muscle
insulin resistance. We will study individuals with obesity before and after a 12-week weight loss intervention.
IMAT will be sampled using an ultrasound guided IMAT biopsy technique, insulin sensitivity measured using
insulin clamps, and IMAT content measured using MRI. Specific Aim 2 – Determine the influence of weight
loss on IMAT secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids and potency to cause inflammation and
decrease insulin sensitivity in vitro. We hypothesize, again based on preliminary data that the IMAT secretome
is less inflammatory after weight loss in obese individuals, with decreased potency to promote muscle
inflammation and insulin resistance. Muscle inflammatory response and insulin sensitivity with IMAT secretome
exposure will be compared before and after weight loss in vitro. The proposed research is innovative because
it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo by testing specific IMAT secreted paracrine
signals rather than clinical associations with IMAT content. These contributions will be significant by identifying
the first IMAT paracrine signals that impact muscle and revealing the plasticity of IMAT through weight loss,
providing proof of concept that IMAT is a therapeutic target to combat muscle metabolic dysfunction."
10898793,"Nearly one in five American adults who survived the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are still suffering from
post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS),42 a complex systemic disease manifests in fatigue and muscle
weakness that substantially limits one or more major life activities.35-41,92 For older adults, having PACS coupled
with an inadequate diet may compound their health deterioration and hasten their physical function decline. 43-
44 Nutritional studies demonstrate that a whole diet comprises foods high in anti-inflammatory activities, e.g.,
whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and omega-3 fatty acid-rich foods substantially reduce disease-related fatigue,
likely by reducing inflammation.49-50 U.S. adults who followed the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) were
more likely to preserve muscle grip strength than those who did not.17 Since fatigue and physical function are
interrelated, a ‘Whole-Diet Approach’56,61,62 aligned with the DGA60 with a focus on nutrients high anti-
inflammatory activities may be an effective strategy to ameliorate recovery from PACS in older adults. This
project proposes to examine, in a 16-week randomized-controlled dietary intervention, the effect of the ‘Whole-
Diet Approach’ on mitigating symptoms of PACS related to nutrition, e.g., fatigue and muscle weakness and
will explore the underlying mechanisms via biomarkers. The sample will comprise men and women aged 50
years or older with PACS, including underrepresented minorities (50% Non-Hispanic-Blacks). At baseline,
N=56 eligible participants will be randomized to either: 1) a dietary intervention following the new DGA with a
focus on nutrients high in anti-inflammatory activities via foods and or supplements (e.g., vitamin D, omega-3,
and whey); or 2) attention control.
Aim 1. In a 16-week, randomized-controlled trial, we will examine the effect of the Whole-Diet Approach
(WDA) on the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) and fatigue compared to attention control in adults with PACS.
Aim 2. To assess the impact of the dietary intervention following the WDA on muscle mass, strength, and
physical function compared to attention control in adults with PACS.
Aim 3. To explore the mechanism of decreased fatigue and improved muscle and physical function by
examining changes in nutritional and inflammatory biomarkers from baseline to 16 weeks.
The proposed dietary intervention to attenuate PACS in older adults is a feasible study relevant to public
health. The University of Maryland Baltimore provides a unique opportunity to be trained by a multidisciplinary
team of mentors who are experts in clinical trials, muscle, physical function, nutrition, geriatrics, statistics, and
COVID-19 to conduct this study successfully. The findings can be translated into a new strategy to counteract
fatigue and physical function decline following PACS. The K01 Award will provide me with the training I need to
become an independent investigator in dietary trials to advance the field of nutrition and aging while gaining
the skills and experience in leadership and mentorship to launch my career in academia."
10841642,"Human betacoronaviruses induce a wide spectrum of respiratory disease. MERS-CoV (MERS) and SARS-CoV-
2 (SARS-2), cause severe lethal pneumonia, while SARS-2 can also cause mild to asymptomatic disease in
some individuals. In contrast, infections with the “common” respiratory human beta-CoV OC43 are largely limited
to the upper respiratory tract. With only a few drugs that show promise against human CoVs, it remains
imperative to develop therapeutics for current and future emergent human CoVs. For this, we need to identify
and understand the host-virus interactions common to all or different among these viruses. A major focus of our
lab has been on the double-stranded (ds)RNA induced host responses to beta-CoVs: interferon production and
signaling; oligoadenylate synthetase-ribonuclease L and protein kinase R (PKR), that are both antiviral and pro-
inflammatory. We have shown that the conserved CoV replicase encoded nsp15 endoribonuclease (Endo)U
reduces dsRNA accumulation and activation of all three pathways while subgenera specific accessory proteins
add to the antagonism. Merbeco (MERS-CoV) and embeco (OC43) viruses shut down these pathways
effectively; in contrast, the sarbecovirus, SARS-2, replicates in respiratory derived cells despite activation of all
three. Preliminary data suggest that downstream effects of RNase L on inflammation and cell death may be more
impactful during SARS-2 infection than the modest antiviral effects. PKR and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), both
kinases of the integrated stress response, when activated, phosphorylate protein synthesis initiation factor eIF2a,
leading to protein synthesis attenuation, providing an important control point in infection. Activation of PERK also
initiates a pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR) to ER stress, which produces antiviral effects and
inflammation. We found that MERS and OC43 infection suppress phosphorylation of eIF2a by preventing PKR
activation and through a PERK pathway feedback loop, dephosphorylating eIF2a. In contrast SARS-2 promotes
p-eIF2a through both PKR and PERK, but maintains viral protein synthesis. This may occur in part via the CoV
replicase nsp1 protein, which promotes selective attenuation of host, but not viral, protein synthesis. Our overall
hypothesis is that betacoronaviruses of each subgenus have evolved unique ways to interact with host
responses to optimize replication and spread and that these differences influence pathogenic outcomes.
We propose to determine: the role of the conserved CoV EndoU and subgenera specific accessory proteins in
antagonizing host innate response pathways; the impact of OAS-RNase L activation on viral replication,
inflammation and cell death; and the effects of host PKR/PERK and viral nsp1 on control of protein synthesis
and virus replication. Our overall goal is to understand the similarities and differences in host interactions among
beta-CoVs of three subgenera. Our findings may identify novel therapeutic interventions targeting host or viral
proteins and indicate whether they may work as pan-CoV therapies or be unique to each beta-CoV subgenus,
and thus help prepare for future CoV outbreaks."
10910156,"Abstract
IgA is the most abundant immunoglobulin produced in the lamina propria (LP) of the intestine and protects the
host against microbial invasions into intestinal mucosa by coating and excluding them. Selective IgA deficiency
is the most common immunodeficiency, and more than 50% of patients are asymptomatic. However, other
patients develop various diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, allergies, autoimmune diseases, and
recurrent infections. Despite the essential roles of IgA, it still remains unknown what causes the different clinical
manifestations of this disease. One of the barriers to understanding the pathology of selective IgA deficiency is
a gap of knowledge about the heterogeneity of developmental origin of the IgA-secreting cells. Our long-term
goal is to fill this knowledge gap and to determine the roles of IgA+ cells of different origins in the mucosal
immunity.
There are two known pathways in producing IgA secreting cells: T-cell independent (TI) and T-cell dependent
(TD) pathways. TI-IgA is a low-affinity polyclonal antibody that coats bacteria and maintains the microbiome
homeostasis, while TD-IgA undergoes somatic hypermutation and reacts against specific antigens. The
precursors of these TI- and TD-IgA have been controversial, but it has recently been demonstrated that TI IgA+
cells are derived from peritoneal B-1b cells while TD IgA+ cells are from germinal center B-2 cells. It is generally
considered that these B-1b and B-2 cells are ultimately produced by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that reside
in the bone marrow (BM). However, our and others' prior work has shown that B-1b cells are also produced by
HSC-independent fetal progenitors during embryonic development. Our lineage tracing data indicated that IgA+
cells in the lamina propria (LP) are derived from embryonic day (E) 7.5 endothelial cells (ECs), three days before
the first HSC production in the embryo. Our lineage tracing system using EC-derived (Cdh5CreERT2) and HSC-
derived (Fgd5CreERT2) enables us to segregate IgA+ cells in the LP of different origins. Thus, the central
hypothesis of this project is that IgA+ cells in the LP consists of cells with different origins: fetal (EC)- and HSC-
derived and that IgA+ cells of different origins have different roles against gut injury and infections. To test our
hypothesis, in Aim1, we will examine TI- and TD- class switching of fetal- and HSC-derived B cells. We will also
visualize these fetal- and HSC-derived TI- and TD- IgA+ cells using scRNA-sequencing and BCR repertoire-
sequencing and will display the molecular differences of these cells. In Aim 2, we will examine the protective
roles of fetal- and HSC-derived IgA+ cells against GI infection with C. rodentium.
The results obtained from this proposal will establish a new paradigm of the developmental origin of IgA+ cells
and their functions in the gut homeostasis and infections."
10907703,"Although there is increasing recognition that viruses are an important cause of sepsis, most clinicians and
policymakers tend to equate sepsis with bacterial infection. As a result, current guidelines emphasize
immediate administration of antibiotics for all patients with suspected sepsis, even though antibiotics will not
benefit patients with pure viral sepsis and may cause harm at both the individual and population levels.
However, the contribution of viruses to the overall burden of sepsis is poorly characterized, and important
questions remain about antibiotic utilization patterns and potential antibiotics-associated harms in this
population. The proposed project seeks to provide rigorous estimates of the proportion of community-onset
sepsis caused by respiratory viruses, describe current antibiotic utilization in viral sepsis, quantify potential
antibiotic-associated harms, and identify patient subgroups in whom antibiotics can safely be limited. The
ultimate goal of the proposal is to promote safer, more nuanced treatment for patients with sepsis, in line with
AHRQ’s stated priorities of improving patient safety and avoiding harm. The proposed research will accomplish
this goal by using large datasets with rich clinical data from electronic health records (EHR) at over 200 diverse
hospitals, a validated EHR-based approach to identifying sepsis, and sophisticated causal inference statistical
techniques to address confounding in order to pursue three aims: (1) Determine the fraction of community-
onset sepsis attributable to respiratory viruses and characterize antibiotic use and predictors of prolonged
antibiotics in this population; (2) Assess hospital-level variation in antibiotic prescribing for patients with viral
sepsis and evaluate risk-adjusted outcomes for patients at high- versus low- utilization hospitals; and (3)
Assess the potential utility of the combination of positive viral assay and low procalcitonin level as an indicator
that antibiotics can safely be withheld or rapidly discontinued.
The candidate, Dr. Claire Shappell, is an advanced research fellow and Pulmonary and Critical Care physician
at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) with experience using EHR data to gain actionable insights into
problems in critical care. Dr. Shappell’s goals during the K08 period are to develop advanced proficiency with
the acquisition, preparation, and handling of large healthcare datasets; learn statistical methods for causal
inference analysis including propensity score methods and approaches to multilevel data; acquire expertise in
the use of R statistical computing software; and strengthen abilities in scientific communication. To achieve
these goals, she has assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship team led by Drs. Michael Klompas and Chanu
Rhee, experts in the use of EHR data for sepsis surveillance and outcomes research. By the completion of the
K08 award period, Dr. Shappell will be well-positioned to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist with expertise using large clinical datasets to improve care for critically ill
patients, with a particular focus on sepsis and antibiotic utilization."
10874725,"Project Summary
 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive liver disease that is a leading cause of liver-related
morbidity and mortality. Having NASH greatly increases the risk of developing end-stage liver disease such as
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the healthcare burden, there are no licensed drug therapies for
NASH. NASH presents as hepatocyte damage, inflammation, and varying degrees of fibrosis, but the distinct
mechanisms that drive this progression are unclear. However, evidence shows that infiltrating macrophages
play a pivotal role in NASH progression. Macrophages are innate immune cells that can polarize into inflamma-
tory phenotypes that exacerbate hepatic injury, or into resolving phenotypes that can mediate liver repair. Yet
the mechanisms driving macrophage polarity in NASH progression are undefined. There is a critical need to
understand the processes that dictate macrophage polarization in NASH progression in order to identify thera-
peutic targets that decrease the burden of NASH.
Our long-term goal is to understand the metabolic regulatory mechanisms dictating macrophage polariza-
tion to develop treatments for NASH and its associated comorbidities. Importantly, macrophage polarization
results in the metabolic rewiring of mitochondrial metabolism. This is not only a consequence of the polariza-
tion process, but the accumulation of specific tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle-derived intermediates profoundly
influences inflammatory and anti-inflammatory gene expression in macrophages. A central player in mitochon-
drial metabolism is the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), which transports pyruvate, a primary product of
glycolysis, into the mitochondrial matrix where it can enter the TCA cycle. Previous evidence shows MPC inhi-
bition alters intracellular TCA metabolites in metabolic cells like myocytes and hepatocytes, but the effect on
macrophages is unknown. Furthermore, our lab has shown that novel MPC inhibitors currently used in clinical
trials effectively reduce NASH in mice. Importantly, the effect of MPC inhibition in macrophages is undefined.
Given the significance of intermediary metabolism in macrophage activation, and the significant role of the
MPC in mitochondrial metabolism, the primary objective of this application is to [1] identify the mechanisms by
which MPC contributes to macrophage activation and polarization, and [2] determine how specific deletion of
MPC in macrophages influences NASH progression. Our central hypothesis is that MPC inhibition in mono-
cyte-derived macrophages will reduce the inflammatory response and mitigate NASH development. Comple-
tion of these studies will contribute to the understanding of mitochondrial metabolism in macrophage function
and NASH progression, and highlight the clinical utility of macrophages in NASH."
10897279,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aortic valve stenosis is the major cause of valve disease in the Western world, and the third leading cause of
adult heart disease. It is a progressive disorder associated with calcification that worsens with aging, thus is
rising in prevalence as the worldwide population ages. There is an unmet need to develop medical therapeutics
for this condition, as the only treatment for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) involves valve replacement. A
major risk factor for calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is present in 1–2%
of the population, and involves formation of a two, rather than three, leaflet valve. ~35% of individuals with BAV
will develop CAVD with age, but some with BAV display leaflet thickening even in childhood. We have previously
reported that loss-of-function mutations in the NOTCH1 gene cause congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and
early-onset CAVD. Patient-specific iPSCs and primary aortic valve cells from CAVD patients without NOTCH1
mutations revealed that abnormal cell fate conversion of valve cells into osteoblast-like cells is the underlying
pathogenesis of CAVD. Using a gene network-based small molecule library screen and a machine learning
algorithm, we found the compound XCT790 broadly corrected gene dysregulation in NOTCH1 haploinsufficient
human iPSC-derived endothelial cells. We postulated XCT790 may function to modulate the cell fate conversion
event regardless of the inciting genetic cause as we did not screen for a NOTCH1 agonist; indeed, in primary
aortic valve endothelial cells from explanted patient valves without evidence of NOTCH1 mutations, the
dysregulated gene network was corrected in the vast majority of patient cells. In a mouse CAVD model, XCT790,
annotated to inhibit estrogen-related receptor-a (ERRa), reduced valvular thickening, stenosis and calcification
in vivo, positing this compound as a strong candidate for therapeutic intervention in CAVD patients. A second
ERRa inhibitor, Compound 29, also corrected gene networks and appears to arrest established disease in mice.
Here we will test the hypothesis that XCT790 prevents the progression of CAVD by targeting ERRα, and that
XCT790 or an oral ERRa inhibitor, Compound 29, has favorable pharmacokinetics and toxicity properties for
further drug development. We propose to achieve this by pursuing the following Aims: 1) Identification of the
molecular target associated with therapeutic activity of XCT790/Compound 29 for CAVD; 2) Determine minimal
dosing and optimal route of administration for XCT790 and Compound 29 for treating two independent models

studies will test the therapeutic potential of XCT790 and Compound 29, and establish the groundwork for clinical
translation of these drugs to treat a disease that represents an enormous unmet medical need, is characterized
by high mortality and morbidity, and for which the main current remedy is invasive surgery."
10877120,"ABSTRACT
 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and refractory subtype of breast cancer for which
limited clinical options are currently available. Although initially responsive to platinum-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, patients with metastatic TNBC rarely survive 5 years after diagnosis. Most TNBC tumors
consist of heterogeneous cell populations with different gene expression profiles. This heterogeneity
contributes to drug resistance, early relapse, and therapeutic failure. Although extensive research efforts have
made a few clinical options available, developing therapeutics that can effectively eradicate a broad range of
TNBC cell populations remains a challenge. Antibody-based drugs such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)
are the most promising targeted therapeutic modality for treating TNBC. Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2
(TROP2) is a protein overexpressed in more than 80% of TNBC, representing a promising molecular target.
Recently, Sacituzumab Govitecan (Trodelvy), a TROP2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), was granted
accelerated approval for the third or later line of treatment of metastatic TNBC. However, TNBC often relapses
after continuous treatment; the intratumor heterogeneous expression of TROP2 and drug resistance induced
by its payload SN-38 likely contribute to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, patients treated with Trodelvy often
suffer from adverse effects, including neutropenia. Thus, enhancing the efficacy, expanding the target scope,
and ensuring the safety of this drug class remain critical clinical needs to develop safe and effective therapies
for patients with heterogeneous TNBC. We have developed novel ADC technologies, including: 1) peptide
linkers for maximizing ADC therapeutic index, and 2) bifunctional chemical spacers and a site-specific
conjugation for generating homogeneous ADCs containing two distinct payloads (termed dual-drug ADCs).
Specifically, our dual-drug ADCs containing two different antimitotic agents showed greatly improved safety
and efficacy in mouse models of HER2-low refractory breast cancer compared with the FDA-approved ADCs
Kadcyla and Enhertu. Based on this success and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that optimally designed
anti-TROP2 dual-drug ADCs effectively eradicate a broad range of solid and metastatic TNBC tumors. In Aim
1, we will investigate how our novel linkers are processed in cancer and normal cells by cell-based assays,
proteomic analysis, and in vivo biodistribution analysis. In Aim 2, we will synthesize novel DNA-alkylator
payloads and potentiators with varying chemical properties. We will then prepare a series of anti-TROP2 dual-
drug ADCs varying in the combination and the number of drugs conjugated to the antibody. In Aim 3, we
evaluate the dual-drug ADCs for toxicity efficacy in TNBC mouse models. Successful completion of this project
will lay the foundations for this novel drug class with the potential to overcome heterogeneity and resistance of
TNBC, which may eventually revolutionize current therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease."
10896276,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by increased mean pulmonary artery pressure, that leads
to vascular remodeling and right heart failure. While endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction drives vascular remodeling,
the events that instigate EC injury are unclear. Platelets circulate proximal to ECs and experimental platelet
depletion has been shown to attenuate pathogenesis in PAH models. However, the mechanisms responsible for
this effect remain elusive. Notably, platelets are highly metabolically active and mediate vascular inflammation,
but these functions have not been fully considered in PAH. We showed that platelets from PAH patients display
metabolic dysfunction with increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and mitochondrial oxidants (mtROS). Preliminary
data indicate this dysfunction is caused by upregulation of the mitochondrial GTPase and mitofusin-1 (MFN-1),
stimulating activation of the NLRP3-dependent inflammasome. Cleavage of caspase-1, an essential component
of the inflammasome, leads to secretion of interleukin-1β (IL-1 β), platelet degranulation, and surface expression
of p-selectin (collectively labeled thrombo-inflammation). New data demonstrate that these platelet-dependent
events trigger EC oxidant production (via NADPH oxidase-1; NOX1) and EC proliferation. Hypothesis: Platelet
MFN1-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction triggers inflammasome mediated thrombo-inflammation, which
leads to EC dysfunction in PAH. Aim 1: Determine how MFN1-dependent platelet mitochondrial
dysfunction triggers inflammasome activation. Using biochemical measures in PAH patients’ platelets, we
will link mitochondrial dysfunction to inflammasome activation. We will induce PAH in transgenic murine models
of platelet-specific MFN1 and caspase-1 silencing, supplemented with lipidomics and redox modulation, to
determine the mechanism by which FAO and mtROS triggers inflammasome activation. PAH will be induced in
a novel secretome mouse to define vasoactive molecules released by platelet degranulation in PAH. Aim 2:
Determine the mechanism(s) by which platelet-driven thrombo-inflammatory signaling causes EC
dysfunction in PAH. Using human/murine platelet-EC co-cultures, we will characterize platelet-driven EC NOX1
activation and proliferation. Using antagonists to signaling mediated by IL-1β and platelet granule factors
identified in Aim 1, we will determine the platelet-dependent signaling axis that causes EC dysfunction. The
contribution of p-selectin dependent platelet-neutrophil aggregates will also be tested. We will utilize EC-specific
NOX1 knockout mice to test the role of platelet-mediated NOX1 activation in PAH. Aim 3: Determine if VX-765,
which inhibits caspase-1 to block inflammasome activation, and attenuates PAH pathogenesis. We will
test the efficacy of VX-765 (in clinical trials for non-PAH pathologies) in rodent models of PAH. These studies
will uncover a novel intra-platelet to EC signaling axis that defines the role of platelets in PAH pathogenesis and
reveals potential therapeutic targets."
10909356,"Metabolic cycles provide building blocks and energy currency for the cell, but also signaling
molecules that regulate diverse physiological responses from differentiation to aging. The
metabolite S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is one such factor that is used to regulate gene
expression in the stress response, a key part of the aging process. We have discovered that
individual SAM synthases has distinct effects and hypothesize that uncovering the mechanisms
regulating local production of SAM will produce novel insights into stress-responses and aging."
10732587,"Abstract – Project 2
The objectives of Project #2 are to improve our understanding of human exposure to environmental microplastics
and to learn how persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and metal ions interact with microplastics to modify toxicity.
Microplastics are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. Though humans are chronically exposed to microplastics,
the literature pertaining to mammalian health risks is sparse. The preponderance of literature focuses on
enumerating the size, shape and color of environmental microplastics and on examining the toxicity of
commercial pure plastic particles, principally polystyrene microspheres, on aquatic organisms. Studies find that
microplastic toxicity increases with decreasing microplastic size, however, collecting environmental microplastic
<100 µm in diameter for testing is challenging, so it is rarely done. Recently, we showed that nanomembrane
filter technology is able to filter microplastics in size ranges that are smaller than is typically feasible and is more
likely to breech epithelial barriers to interact directly with cells. Furthermore, it is known that environmental
microplastics adsorb POPs and/or metal pollutants, yet little is fundamentally understood about how
microplastic/pollutant interactions may alter toxicity. This project seeks to remedy these knowledge gaps by
enumerating the presence of microplastics <100 µm in diameter in Lake Ontario water and in airborne Lake
spray and testing the microplastic enriched in the retentate for cytotoxicity/bioactivity including aryl hydrocarbon
receptor activity and endocrine disrupting properties. We will investigate microplastic interactions with POPs
and metals that are abundant in Lake Ontario as a function of temperature to account for seasonal variations
and climate change. The overall hypothesis of this project is that filtered debris from Lake Ontario water and
airborne Lake spray will exhibit biological activity and that pollutant-MP interactions will alter bioactivity
depending on MP composition and temperature."
10732588,"This research proposal addresses growing concerns about small plastic debris (0.1µm to 5 mm) or
Microplastics (MPs) that have become major pollutants of aquatic ecosystems worldwide and pose serious
threats to human health. We propose to leverage a comparative biology approach using the amphibian
Xenopus laevis to define the biodistribution of representative environmentally relevant virgin and
experimentally aged MPs; and determine how postembryonic exposure to these MPs can induce
perturbations of development, fitness, immune homeostasis, chronic inflammation, and poorer
antimicrobial immunity that are exacerbated at higher water temperature.
Our rationale to leverage X. laevis is that (1) it is a reliable, extensively characterized and widely recognized
model of human perinatal and biomedical research; (2) because the post-embryonic development of X. laevis
tadpoles is external and not protected by the maternal environment, the immune system differentiation is
particularly sensitive to perturbations by water pollutant such as MPs; (3) X. laevis wide thermotolerance is
ideal for exploring the influence of temperature on MP biodistribution and biological activity; (4) it is cost
effective to expose tadpoles in large numbers to MPs; and (5) X. laevis immune system is remarkably similar to
that of humans and we have convincingly established X. laevis as a human health relevant experimental
organism to reveal deleterious effects of developmental exposure to water pollutants.
To test the hypothesis that developmental exposure to MPs induces perturbations of development,
fitness, immune homeostasis, chronic inflammation and poorer antiviral immunity that are exacerbated
at higher water temperature, we will determine: (1) the biodistribution of environmentally-relevant virgin and
experimentally aged MPs in exposed tadpoles, by visualizing and quantifying the transit, dissemination and
accumulation of different types, doses, sizes and treatments of MPs in exposed tadpoles; (2) the effect of
water temperature on MP’s biodistribution, by comparing the changes in biodistribution and accumulation of
various MPs at different temperatures; and (3) the impacts of virgin and aged MPs on development, fitness,
immunity, and resistance to pathogens by monitoring the survival, developmental rate, success, and fitness of
tadpole exposed to virgin and aged post-consumer MPs for Ontario Lake, as well as by assessing whether
later in life young adult frogs have any defects in basal immune function or resistance to infectious diseases.
 We anticipate that this innovative project will provide crucially needed evidence about biodistribution,
biological activity and health risks posed by MPs in water under current and future climate scenarios, including
exacerbated or deregulated immune function and resistance to microbial pathogens. In addition, we will identify
sensitive and reliable biomarkers useful for human studies. Given the high degree of evolutionary conservation
of vertebrate physiology, the expected outcomes from this study will be applicable and relevant to humans."
10896297,"Corneal diseases and injuries leading to visual impairment have significant impact on the quality of life of
patients and constitute a major problem for health care system. Corneal diseases are often manifested through
limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) dysfunction and loss, leading to corneal opacity, visual impairment, and
blindness. LESC located in the limbal niche are the source of constant corneal epithelial renewal and are
required to maintain corneal epithelial homeostasis by adapting properly to internal and external stimuli.
However, persistent exposure to pathological stress disrupts the adaptive mechanisms of LESC, leading to
serious corneal problems such as altered wound healing, limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) and diabetic
keratopathy. Therefore, understanding the precise spatial and temporal regulatory pathways and how each
LESC/limbal epithelial cells (LECs) responds to various stimuli at the single-cell level governing corneal
epithelial regeneration could be key to elucidating the pathogenesis of various corneal diseases and ultimately
developing new and effective treatment strategies. Previously, we have shown the important regulatory role of
miR-146a in corneal epithelial homeostasis and wound healing via its different targeted pathways such as
EGFR, Notch and NF-κB signaling. However, due to the heterogeneity of limbal basal cells and their proximity
to limbal stromal cells, it remains to be determined how miRNAs (miRs) regulate maintenance, differentiation,
and the active stage of limbal progenitor cells in various corneal cell populations in wounded and unwounded
normal and diseased corneas. Recently several studies have shown the heterogeneity and complexity of limbal
niche in relation to regeneration and wound healing and identified new putative LESC markers using newly
emerged empowering scRNA-seq technology. We propose to investigate the regulatory role and contribution of
each miR-146 main targets (EGFR, TRAF6, IRAK1, NUMB and NOTCH-2) in corneal epithelial regeneration in
wounded and unwounded states in normal and diabetic corneas using scRNA-seq, proteomics, loss and gain
of functional studies. We hypothesize that miR-146a contribute to the molecular regulation of cellular
heterogeneity in the limbal niche steady state. We predict that differential miR-146a expression in limbus vs.
central corneal epithelium impacts its regulation of limbal niche cells, LECs and limbal stromal cells, and
mediates corneal regeneration and wound healing in normal and diseased states. Our Specific Aims are:
Specific Aim 1: To identify and characterize downstream targets including EGFR, Notch and inflammatory
mediators of miR-146a in distinct populations of heterogeneous limbal stem cells that contribute to homeostatic
maintenance and regeneration in human normal unwounded and wounded cornea. Specific Aim 2: To reveal
the differential and converged regulatory role of EGFR, inflammatory, and Notch signaling by miR-146a in
corneal epithelial homeostasis and wound healing. Specific Aim 3: To investigate miR146a-based therapeutic
approach by modulating its targets in human diabetic organ-cultured corneas."
10928793,"This is a competitive renewal application for R01-AA025653. Over the last 6 years, we have conducted
neuroimaging studies in over 400 South African (SA) youth [8-12-years-old; ~300 with prenatal alcohol
exposure (PAE) and ~100 non-exposed Controls (NC); 50% girls] from the Prenatal Alcohol, SIDS and
Stillbirth (PASS) prospective birth cohort. The PASS cohort is comprised of ~6,000 SA children (born 2008-
2014; now ~8-15-years-old) whose mothers reported on drinking behavior during pregnancy. With pseudo-
random selection criteria for the PAE participants recruited during the 1st funding period, the quantity of total
drinks during pregnancy was (on average) quite low (range: ~1-611 drinks, M = 27.6, SD = 59.2 ). During this
renewal period, we have the opportunity to extend recruitment to over-sample youth with much higher PAE
quantities (range: ~32-817 drinks, M = 123.9, SD = 110.8). For renewal, we have developed a novel cohort-
sequential cross-sectional/longitudinal study design, in which we would bring back ~50% of participants
recruited during the 1st funding period (~150 PAE, ~50 NC) for longitudinal assessment of brain, cognition, and
facial morphology (BCF), plus recruitment of ~250 new PASS participants (~200 PAE, ~50 NC). This will
permit 1) recruitment of more highly exposed PAE participants to span the range of exposure, 2) study of a
broader age range across adolescence among PAE and NC from 8 to 17 years during which dramatic brain
development continues, and 3) utilization of data collected during the 1st 6 years both in the longitudinal
component and with newly recruited participants in the cross-sectional component. Notably, most children with
heavy PAE experience greater early life adversity than NC children, and early intervention is believed to be key
in attenuating PAE-effects, the latter of which may depend, in part, on understanding the impact of quantity,
frequency and timing (QFT) and early life experiences. Our history of productive team-work and existing
infrastructure, coupled with experienced staff and collaborators in South Africa over the last 6 years, bode well
for renewal, putting us in an exceptional position to further understanding how QFT of PAE independently, or
interactively, impacts associations between (1) brain and cognition/behavior, (2) brain and early life
environment, and (3) brain and facial morphology as function of environmental/maternal factors. We will use
identical measures of brain structure/function, 3D facial imaging, cognition (WISC-V), early life experience
(e.g., maternal age, nutrition, parity, mental health, substance use both perinatally and currently) and
environmental risk factors (e.g., multiple measures of SES, access to resources, stress), measured perinatally
and during childhood. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal quantitative measures from 3D facial imaging will
be utilized in parallel with neuroimaging and cognitive assessments. Using the entire range of PAE, we expect
independent and interactive (e.g., quantity by timing) effects of QFT on brain/cognition/face associations, with
the largest effects driven by quantity, followed by frequency, and then timing of PAE."
10927455,"Abstract
Severe burn injury rapidly activates a systemic inflammatory response and cardiovascular dysfunction, causing
distributive shock associated with increased endothelial permeability and organ injury. Sepsis is a leading
cause of death in patients with severe burn injury, accounting for nearly 75% of mortality among burn patients.
Preventing or recognizing sepsis early is key to preventing poor outcomes in burn patients. However, it is
difficult to (1) detect burn patients at higher risk of sepsis at the time of intensive care unit presentation and (2)
distinguish between sepsis and the non-infective inflammatory response to severe burn injury. To date, most
data for detecting infection and sepsis in non-burn patients do not necessarily inform diagnosis in the burn
patient population given the specificities of burn injury. Though some studies have identified potential
biomarkers as candidate septic markers in burn patients, these markers are derived from a very small number
of patients or were not combined and showed limited predictive value. Thus, due to the unique
pathophysiology of severe burns, there is an unmet clinical need to identify early biomarker signatures of
patients at risk of sepsis and septic shock in the burn patient population.
Our central hypothesis is that the initial host response to burn injury could predispose to secondary sepsis.
That is, a dysregulated cardiovascular injury and inflammatory profile in adult patients with severe burn injury
exposes burn patients to a higher risk of developing sepsis. In this proposal, we will longitudinally analyze
plasma samples and clinical outcomes in a large cohort of burn patients (n=400) with severe burn injury.
Biomarker analysis of immune dysregulation and cardiovascular injury will be used to define sub-phenotypes of
patients and linked to the primary endpoint (sepsis) and secondary outcomes (mortality, ICU length of stay,
organ failure). Proof of principle results from this large prospective cohort study will then be used to guide and
inform future prospective trials and emulated trials of therapeutic interventions to identify (1) populations at
higher risk of sepsis and (2) therapeutic pathways that could be targeted to prevent secondary sepsis in this
high-risk population. Finally, we will compare proteomic signatures between burn patients without sepsis (i.e.,
non-septic systemic inflammatory response) and burn patients with sepsis and control non-burn critically ill
patients with sepsis or septic shock. The results of these studies will provide key insights into the identification
of biomarkers and proteomic signatures specific to sepsis and improve our ability to recognize sepsis."
10861858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
EWS fusion oncoproteins are critical drivers in a number of malignancies, including the pediatric solid tumor
Ewing sarcoma, the second most common pediatric cancer involving bone. In the case of Ewing sarcoma, the
fusion of EWS to the ETS transcription factor FLI1 generates an oncogenic pioneer transcription factor that alters
a distinctive set of regulatory elements to control oncogenic gene expression. The impact of repression of the
EWS/FLI1 fusion with approaches such as shRNA, CRISPR, or targeted protein degradation is now well
described and known to be deleterious to Ewing sarcoma cells. In contrast, the potential of EWS/FLI1 overdose
is just newly described and has been understudied. We recently discovered a powerful and novel selective
dependency in Ewing sarcoma on TRIM8, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Remarkably, TRIM8 controls the levels of
EWS/FLI1 protein, and its inactivation leads to an increase in EWS/FLI1 protein levels that is not tolerated by
tumor cells. Ewing sarcoma cells must thus carefully regulate the levels of EWS/FLI1 within a narrow “just right,”
“Goldilocks” range. Either too little or too much fusion protein is lethal. The mechanisms that control optimal
levels of EWS/FLI1 and that mediate cell lethality from high levels of the fusion protein are unknown. We expect
that defining these mechanisms will reveal important principles of Ewing sarcoma biology that may also be
applicable to other EWS fusion proteins, and that this knowledge may point to new therapeutic strategies. The
overall goal of this proposal is thus to determine the mechanisms of EWS/FLI1 induced toxicity following TRIM8
loss in Ewing sarcoma through three aims. The gene regulation properties of EWS/FLI1 are highly dependent
on the formation of biomolecular condensates, which in turn require the phase transition properties of the EWS
disordered prion-like domain. Similarly, TRIM8 has been described to have a role in condensate formation. Thus,
in Aim 1, we will determine the relationship between TRIM8 and EWS/FLI1 biomolecular condensates with the
hypothesis that that EWS/FLI1 regulation by TRIM8 is dependent on condensate formation and that, in turn, loss
of TRIM8 leads to changes in condensates. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of TRIM8 loss on epigenetic
states in Ewing sarcoma including 3D interactions. In Aim 3, we will identify the mechanisms by which EWS/FLI1
overdose is toxic. Based on gene expression and ORF screening data, we will lead this aim with the hypothesis
that the glutamate receptor GRM2 mediates toxicity downstream of EWS/FLI1 overdose. New therapeutic
approaches distinct from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and local control measures are needed for patients
with Ewing sarcoma as little progress has been made in treating high-risk patients over several decades. These
proposed studies exploring an innovative strategy of oncogene overdose have potential for future translational
impact in addition to revealing basic underlying mechanisms of disease."
10887647,"In the United States, more than a third of patients are referred to a specialist each year, and specialist visits
constitute more than half of outpatient visits. Even though all physicians highly value communication between
primary care providers (PCPs) and specialists, both PCPs and specialists cite the lack of effective information
transfer as one of the most significant problems in the referral process. Therefore, it is critical to investigate a
new method to improve communication during care transitions. With their ubiquitous use, it is recognized that
electronic health records (EHRs) should ensure a seamless flow of information across healthcare systems to
improve the referral process. But, a lack of accessible and relevant information in the referral process remains a
pressing problem. Recently, emerging deep learning (DL) and natural language processing (NLP) methods have
been successfully applied in extracting pertinent information from EHRs and generating text summarization to
improve care quality and patient outcomes. However, existing technologies cannot be applied to process
heterogeneous data from EHRs and create high-quality clinical summaries for communicating a reason for
referral. Responding to PA-20-185, this project will develop and validate a novel informatics framework to collect
and synthesize longitudinal, multimodal EHR data for automatic referral form generation and summarization.
While the referring provider and specialist can be any type of provider for any condition, the focus in this
application has been on headache for primary care, because it is an extremely common symptom and affects
people of all ages, races, and socioeconomic statuses. More importantly, relevant information needed for
headache referrals has been defined in local and national evidence-based practice guidelines. Therefore, a
health information technology solution to make these data accessible will empower communication between
PCPs and specialists, which can improve the care of millions of patients suffering from disabling headache
disorders. Based on our preliminary data and our experience with an interdisciplinary team of data scientists and
physicians, we plan to execute specific aims: 1) Convert text-based guidelines into a standards-based algorithm
for electronic implementation; 2) develop models to automatically populate data from EHR and clinical notes to
fill the referral form; 3) create a framework to summarize the longitudinal clinical notes to fill out the referral form;
and 4) develop and validate the headache referral system with a user-centered design approach. The research
proposed in this project is novel and innovative because it will produce and rigorously test new solutions to
improve the communication between health professonals to ensure that safe, high-quality care is provided and
care continuity is maintained. The success of this project will (1) fill important gaps in our knowledge of
understanding the types of information exchange that will optimize patient care during transitions and (2) provide
evidence-based solutions to enable the exchange."
10932231,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Peripheral artery disease, an atherosclerotic disorder typically of the lower extremities, is a life threatening and
debilitating condition affecting millions of Americans. Once diagnosed, medical management including initiation
of antiplatelet therapy, lipid lowering medications, and behavioral therapy such as supervised exercise and
smoking cessation have all been shown to significantly improve health outcomes for those with PAD. However,
diagnosis of PAD can be difficult due to poor patient and provider awareness of the disease, a high prevalence
of atypical symptoms and conflicting guideline recommendations on screening. Furthermore, despite having
similar to higher prevalence of disease, Blacks, females and individuals in lower socioeconomic groups are
diagnosed later in the disease process, contributing to poorer outcomes. To address low diagnosis rates we
developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model to detect PAD prior to clinician diagnosis using vast
amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data and advanced machine learning algorithms. However, for our
technology to have real-world impact, there is a clear need to: 1) Validate performance of our AI-based PAD
detection model across diverse clinical settings and populations (Aim 1), 2), Evaluate clinical utility of using an
AI-based PAD screening tool and design effective clinical workflows to enhance net benefit and adoption (Aim
2), and 3) Evaluate the effect of an AI-based PAD screening tool on rates of PAD diagnosis and medical
management patterns (Aim 3). Aim 1 will be conducted using EHR data from 3 clinical sites with distinctly
different patient populations. Our final model will be validated using the unique American Family Cohort
registry, a rich outpatient-based EHR dataset made up of patients from all 50 states, including nearly
1,000,000 rural residents and over 600,000 racial/ethnic minorities. We will perform rigorous evaluation of AI
model bias using algorithmic fairness metrics. Using decision analysis we will evaluate model utility to ensure
our models demonstrate positive net benefit prior to deployment and we will also employ a unique quality
improvement and mixed methods approach to work with providers to develop clinical workflows that foster the
use of AI for PAD detection and maximize model benefit. Lastly, using a stepped wedge clinical trial design we
will perform a pragmatic analysis of the effect of an AI-based PAD screening tool on rates of PAD diagnosis
and treatment. At the conclusion of this study, we will have developed an understanding of how an AI-based
PAD screening tool can be used to improve PAD detection, reduce disparities in diagnosis rates, and improve
medical management."
10732776,"Project Summary/Abstract
The candidate is currently an MD-PhD student at the CCHMC (University of Cincinnati) in the laboratory of Dr.
Artem Barski. The proposal describes a combined research and training program leading to independent carreer
in biomedical research. The research goal of this project is to identify functional silencers in human T cells and
to understand their mechanism of action. Over 98% of the human genome is non-coding. It is believed that many
non-coding sequences are regulatory, and are dynamically utilized in a cell type specific manner to dictate
programs of gene expression. While enhancers have widely been studied in health and disease including cancers
like T-ALL, the location and biological function of silencers is largely unknown. Like enhancers, silencers are
believed contribute to cell type specific patterns of gene expression, and thus hold unique requirements for
regulation and function in different cell types. Particularly, the contribution of silencers to transcriptome
maintenance in human T cells, and the mechanism for silencer activation by canonical repressors (PRC2) is
unknown. There is a critical need to directly interrogate functional silencers in CD4+ T cells. I have constructed
a silencer screen using a negative selection method to identify the sequences of functional (active) silencers from
a genome-wide library of open chromatin in T cells. Preliminary results from my screen in Jurkat cells suggests
that functional silencers are largely in unique locations compared to recently published silencer assays.
Functional silencers in Jurkat cells also enrich for T cell specific transcription factor motifs, and exist nearest to
genes involved in T cell homeostasis, activation, and Th differentiation. I hypothesize that a T cell specific
repertoire of silencers actively maintain homeostasis of resting T cells cell by active suppression of aberrant
gene expression. In Aim I, I seek to identify functional silencer elements in human CD4+ T cells using the novel
assay which I have developed. This work will contribute an atlas of functional silencer elements, including
patterns of histone marks and repressor transcription factors enriched at these elements, and elucidate a silencer
controlled regulatory network to stimulate hypothesis generation and the research of others. In Aim II, I will
investigate a mechanism of silencer activation by canonical repressor PRC2, and determine if some functional
silencer sequences also dictate H3K27me3 mediated gene repression. Collectively this work is expected to
provide new insights into T cell biology with novel functional data of gene regulation by silencer elements. I
expect this work to generate a highly relevant atlas of silencer elements in CD4+ T cells, experimental validation
of transcription factors which regulate these elements, and support for a hypothesis that PRC2 coordinates
silencer function by mediating both transcriptional repression and H3K27me3 directed transcriptional
regulation. Guided by my supportive and experienced mentorship team, I hope to continue developing the
scientific and clinical skills necessary to make meaningful contributions to patient outcomes throughout my
independent research career."
10862710,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Radiotherapy is the most effective nonsurgical treatment for glioblastoma; however, therapeutic efficacy is
severely limited due to the development of radioresistance (RR). In the hope of overcoming this urgent clinical
problem, significant research has focused on defining the molecular mechanisms underlying RR. The overall
objective of this application is to confirm the assembly of the ETC into mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes
(SCs) as a novel mechanism of RR. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that RR in GBM is the result of a
rearrangement of the ETC complexes into SCs triggered by the expression of COX4-1, which promotes
reprograming of glioma cell bioenergetics from predominantly aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation and, consequently, reduces the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The
specific aims proposed will use established glioma cell lines, patient-derived xenograft lines, preclinical animal
models, and patient tumor samples to rigorously assess the validity of this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the
role of CcO in SC assembly and mitochondrial metabolism. Aim 2 will evaluated the effects of SC on the
regulation of ROS. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of SCs in the response of IR. We expect that data generated
will vertically advance our understanding of how respiratory SCs affect outcomes in GBM and reveal the
therapeutic vulnerability in RR GBM than can be exploited by SC- disrupting agents."

The purpose of UCaTS Project 2 is to target clinically important genomic markers of early resistance to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), to develop
quantitative models of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)-driven signaling pathways under inhibition, and to
explore the role race, ethnicity and genetic ancestry has in predicting baseline EGFR signaling and EGFR-TKI
treatment response. EGFR-mutant NSCLC comprises a substantial subset of lung adenocarcinoma (15% in
Western/White populations) and occurs with a higher frequency in Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, Pacific
Islanders (AANHPI ~50%), and Latinos (~38%). EGFR mutations show strong associations with smoking status,
gender, race/ethnicity, and genetic ancestry. Women of AANHPI and Latino race/ethnicity have, compared to
non-Latino Whites (NLW), lower smoking rates and higher frequency of EGFR mutant tumors. Interestingly, a
recent study showed that high Indigenous American Ancestry (which is closely associated with Asian ancestry)
confers a higher risk of developing EGFR-mutant lung cancer in Latinos. This suggests that somatic EGFR
mutations have close associations of biological and non-biological aspects associated with race/ethnicity or
ancestry. Through this research, we will develop novel therapeutic strategies with combinations of FDA approved
and NCI-CTEP drugs to translate into NCI-sponsored clinical trials overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance
mechanisms associated in EGFR-mutant NSCLC. We will also assess whether race/ethnicity and genetic
ancestry impacts EGFR signaling and influences responses to EGFR inhibition.
 Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have been broadly used in lung cancer research and drug development.
We have extensive experience in establishing PDXs and conducting PDX-based research. Through the Jackson
Laboratory (JAX), UCSF and UT Southwestern collaborations, we established and characterized over 200 lung
cancer PDXs in which 25 have EGFR-activating mutations and we have identified an additional 10 EGFR-mutant
lung cancer models in PDXnet. We anticipate that UCaTS will generate at least 25 additional EGFR-mutant
PDXs. We have performed detailed histopathological and genomic characterization on many of these PDXs
focused on oncogene driven NSCLC where we identified multiple putative resistance mechanisms that mediate
early resistance to current EGFR-targeted therapeutic approaches in these models. We have also shown that
EGFR-mutant PDXs can potentially be used to optimize treatment combinations to overcome EGFR-TKI
resistance and to identify the most efficacious drugs or drug combinations including FDA approved and NCI-
CTEP agents. We will use a high-content live-cell imaging platform to analyze intracellular EGFR signaling, which
provides a high-resolution assessment of cellular adaptation to inhibition. The work for this project arises out of
our current research, which will be used to address the following specific aims.:
Aim 1: Develop targeted treatment combinations with FDA approved drugs and/or NCI-CTEP agents to
overcome mechanisms of resistance to EGFR-TKIs that herald early tumor progression. We plan to a)
determine the most effective dual MET/EGFR targeting strategy in EGFR-mutant PDX models harboring MET-
mediated bypass tract mechanisms of EGFR-TKI resistance; b) determine the most effective dual EGFR-
blockade approach in EGFR-mutant PDXs harboring uncommon EGFR-mutations; and c) overcome the limited
apoptotic response in RBM10 deficient EGFR-mutant NSCLC with the BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor and NCI-CTEP
agent pelcitoclax.
Aim 2: Modeling EGFR inhibitor effects using signaling dynamics in live cells. The premise is that targeted
inhibitor therapy can be optimized by characterizing quantitative variation in RTK-driven intracellular signaling
across different EGFR mutants, genetic backgrounds, and inhibitor classes. We will use kinase activity
biosensors to track AKT and ERK activity patterns with single-cell resolution in the set of PDX models used in
Aim 1. This high-content analysis, in combination with the diverse set of EGFR mutations and genetic
backgrounds represented by the PDX panel, will provide the data for a quantitative model with an unprecedented
scope. Leveraging machine learning methods, our model will allow us to identify the primary signaling
parameters determining response to multiple classes (and combinations) of EGFR inhibitors, MET inhibitors,
and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL family inhibitors. Importantly, our model will help to answer a long-standing question of whether
EGFR inhibitor resistance involves a shared set of signaling determinants across individuals and backgrounds,
or instead depends on patient or genetic background-specific factors. Furthermore, when our results are
integrated with Aim 1, we will have the unique opportunity to validate our cellular model against in vivo data.
Aim 3: Examining the role of race/ethnicity and genetic ancestry in EGFR signaling and responses to
EGFR therapies. As our study will test EGFR therapies in large numbers of EGFR-mutant models from AANHPI,
Latinos, and NLW, we will evaluate whether baseline signaling and responses to the third generation EGFR-TKI
osimertinib are influenced by race/ethnicity. In Latinos, we will also estimate individual levels of Indigenous
American ancestry and will evaluate its associations with baseline signaling and treatment response.
IMPACT: This project will advance EGFR therapy and our understanding of EGFR signaling in lung cancer with
a focus on minorities, including information that will lead to a more equitable translation into clinical trials."

People who experience repeated brain injuries (BIs) before the brain recovers from the initial trauma are at a
high risk for neurological deficits, depression, suicide, and Alzheimer-like symptoms. Women who experience
intimate partner violence (IPV) are at high risk for injuries to their head, neck and face – potentially resulting in
an acquired BI. Among IPV survivors, BI can occur due to a traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting from a bump,
blow, or jolt to the head or through strangulation. BI can have long term consequences on IPV survivors' well-
being and quality of life. Comprehensive screening among this vulnerable population and timely
neurorehabilitation interventions (i.e., referral to, and receipt of, evidence-based approaches to mitigate BI-
related health outcomes) have the potential to mitigate the impact of IPV-related BI and improve health
outcomes. Despite the high risk of BI among IPV survivors and the availability of evidence-based approaches
to address BI, there are no standard guidelines for BI screening in this group of women. The long-term goal is
to advance scientific understanding of implementation strategies related to the secondary prevention of IPV-
related BI that will inform future policies for timely screening, referral, and neurorehabilitation and ultimately
reduce neurological damage among this population. The objective of this project is to examine how screening
and detection of IPV-related BI can be effectively integrated into the workflow for community-based
organizations (CBOs) serving IPV survivors using a participatory approach. The central hypothesis has been
formulated based on preliminary studies and posits that CBO and stakeholder derived implementation
strategies can improve the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of timely screening/detection and
referral of IPV survivors at risk for a BI. Using the PRISM/RE-AIM framework and a participatory approach of
community-engaged dissemination and implementation, these aims will be pursued. Aim 1: To evaluate
adoption, implementation, and sustainability strategies of a brain injury screening intervention of IPV survivors
at CBOs with and without stakeholder developed implementation strategies. Aim 2. To determine the reach
and effectiveness of a brain injury screening intervention at CBOs serving survivors of IPV. Exploratory Aim.
Determine client and CBO implementer's perception of the screening intervention and implementation
strategies used in the project. The expected outcome is to increase currently limited knowledge of potential
implementation strategies to integrate routine screening and referral for IPV-related BI. This outcome is
expected to significantly contribute to the knowledge base needed to fully integrate the routine screening and
referral of IPV-related BI in CBOs serving IPV survivors. The project will also allow for the identification of
potential screening and referral strategies that can be used to connect patients with IPV-related BI to evidence-
based approaches to mitigate poor health outcomes and identify methods to achieve secondary prevention."

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) formation and subsequent aortic rupture can lead to sudden death and is a
significant clinical problem with no currently known medical treatments available. The hallmarks of patient AAA
include thrombus formation and cell death mechanisms such as apoptosis and neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs). The clearance of dead cell debris is mediated via the process of efferocytosis, by which apoptotic
tissue is recognized for engulfment by professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) and non-professional
phagocytes (e.g., endothelial cells; ECs), and remains to be elucidated in the pathogenesis of AAA. Thus, our
hypothesis focuses on the dysregulation of inflammation-resolution pathways that lead to to defective
efferocytosis and promote chronic aortic tissue inflammation and vascular remodeling. Our recent study has
demonstrated a critical role orchestrated by EC-dependent pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels in causing aortic
inflammation and AAA formation. The scientific premise of this proposal focuses on the dysregulation of EC-
mediated efferocytosis causing an imbalance of inflammation-resolution via Panx1 activation in AAA
progression. Therefore, the central hypothesis in this proposal is that EC efferocytosis is dysregulated due to
cleavage of MerTK, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor that recognizes apoptotic cells, leading to
accumulation of dead cell debris and thrombus formation. Second, our mechanistic studies will dissect the
dynamic communication between ECs and macrophages, involving defective EC-mediated efferocytosis
leading to excessive iron-mediated cell death (ferroptosis) in macrophages, that collectively feedbacks to
cause Panx1 activation and an chronic inflammatory loop. Our supportive data demonstrates that resolution of
aortic inflammation is associated with increased EC-dependent MerTK expression and efferocytosis of
neutrophils. Furthermore, defective EC-mediated efferocytosis exacerbates ferroptosis in macrophages (via
SLC7A11 and Nrf2-signaling) that feedbacks to cause EC-Panx1 activation and eATP release. Collectively, our
results suggest that dysregulation of EC-mediated efferocytosis and macrophage-dependent ferroptosis
creates a break in the inflammation-resolution process during AAA formation and aortic rupture. We will
delineate the proposed studies using the murine elastase-treatment AAA and our innovative aortic rupture
model, as well as by analysis of human AAA tissue from our biorepository. Using novel inducible cell-specific
genetic knockout mice such as Cdh5Cre-ERT2/MerTKfl/fl, MerTKCR (cleavage-resistant), and Cx3CR1Cre-
ERT2/SLC7A11fl/fl mice, we will delineate the previously unknown mechanisms of dysregulated efferocytosis and
ferroptosis in activation of Panx1 channels during AAA formation. Our studies will provide novel insight into
mechanisms of molecular signaling interactions between ECs and macrophages to define the inflammatory
loop between efferocytosis/ferroptosis/Panx1 for the treatment of AAAs and prevention of aortic rupture."

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), often referred as “chemobrain”, is prevalent up to
75% of all breast cancer survivors. These impairments cause significant distress and reduce the
quality for life for survivors. Despite growing realization of the long-term clinical problem of CRCI
in millions of cancer survivors, there is a conspicuous absence of clinical recourse available.
Therefore, regenerative strategies to restore cognition and normal brain function in the cancer
patients and survivors are clearly needed. Our past clinical and pre-clinical studies have
established that doxorubicin, which is commonly used in breast cancer, can lead to a significant
decline in the blood (human) and brain (rodent) levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
BDNF is abundantly expressed in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and plays important
roles in neuronal repair and survival, dendritic and axonal growth, long-term potentiation, and
neural stem cell maintenance. In our human studies, pathological reductions of BDNF were linked
to higher risk of cognitive toxicity. Similarly, we have shown that chronic chemotherapy
significantly impaired performance on the hippocampus and cortex-dependent cognitive tasks in
the rodents. These deficits were linked with reduced neurogenesis, elevated neuroinflammation,
and significant damage to the newly born and mature neuronal architecture, dendrites, spines,
and synaptic integrity. To mitigate these deficits, our preliminary rodent studies involving mice
receiving doxorubicin with riluzole, an orally active glutamate-modulating medication, has
prevented the reduction of hippocampus BDNF levels. Thus, we hypothesize that: i)
chemotherapy-induced reduction of BDNF leads to the long-term neurodegenerative
consequences culminating into cognitive impairments and, ii) augmentation of BDNF in vivo will
restore cognitive function in brains exposed to chemotherapy and will provide neuroprotection
against CRCI. We will test our hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will systematically
examine brain and plasma BDNF levels to link its trajectory with CRCI and neurobiological
underpinnings in a mouse model of breast cancer chemotherapy. In Aim 2, we will determine the
neuroprotective impact of enhancing BDNF in vivo to reverse CRCI. In Aim 3, we will evaluate
the neuroprotective effect of BDNF-enhancing riluzole to ameliorate CRCI. This study will link the
neurobiological underpinnings of chemotherapy and neuroprotective effects of BDNF against
CRCI. If demonstrated to be successful, our translationally feasible pharmacological
approach will provide basis for future studies to repurpose riluzole as a therapeutic option
for mitigating CRCI."

Healthy development in children relies on social recognition of caregivers and communication of needs, which
requires evaluating sensory information and making appropriate and intentional movements. Although this
process, referred to as perceptual motor development, is critical for infant social bonding, cognitive development,
and lifelong wellbeing, the neuronal basis remains largely unknown. This severe gap in knowledge stems, in
part, from the difficulty in manipulating neonate brains and a paucity of robust neonate behaviors as reliable
motor outputs in traditional laboratory animals. To address this deficit, this research aims to uncover basic brain
mechanisms of neonate social-motor displays using social tadpoles that beg their parents for food by dancing.
We combine this novel research organism and behavioral paradigm with advanced neurogenetic tools to
interrogate the neuronal substrates of perceptual motor development for infant communication. Recent data from
our lab shows that parental recognition is based on olfactory cues, the begging motor display is regulated by
dopamine signaling, and the fragile X protein FMRP is enriched specifically in begging neurons. Based on this
robust preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that FMRP regulates the dopaminergic signaling
required for perceptual motor development. As social recognition is a critical component of infant communication
towards caregivers, we will determine how olfactory cues encode caregiver recognition and gate the activity of
dopaminergic neurons necessary for begging displays using in vivo imaging and cell ablation experiments. We
will also test the role of FMRP in tuning dopaminergic signaling by examining transcriptional changes in
dopamine-sensitive cells in FMRP knockout tadpoles compared to wild type animals. Finally, voluntary motor
movements likely involve striatal neurons and preliminary suggests begging tadpoles have increased striatal
activity. We will functionally test the role of the dopaminergic inputs into the striatum in executing begging
behavior and determine how FMRP tunes striatal dopamine signaling. Together, the proposed experiments will
systematically dissect the mechanisms by which FMRP and dopamine neurons regulate infant social recognition
and communication in a research organism with experimental tractability and a robust social-motor output that
is difficult to achieve in other research organisms. As the molecular factors and overall brain organization of
social-motor behaviors are conserved across vertebrates, this research will identify generalizable principles of
perceptual motor development, a behavior critical for infant survival and life-long wellbeing."

Sodium-glucose cotransport inhibitors (SGLT2i) lower the plasma glucose concentration by promoting
glucosuria and have been shown to be effective in preventing cardiovascular events, including heart failure,
and in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. However, the
uptake of the SGLT2i, especially in the general medical community but also by cardiologists and nephrologists,
has been retarded by the development of diabetic ketoacidosis. Although uncommon in T2DM, DKA occurs in
3-5% of T1DM individuals treated with SGLT2i and primarily for this reason the SGLT2i have not been
approved by FDA for use in T1DM individuals. Consequently, T1DM subjects have been excluded from all
large-scale CV and renal outcome studies. Further, the glucose lowering efficacy of the SGLT2i is blunted by
their stimulation of hepatic glucose production (HGP), which offsets by ~50% the amount of glucose excreted
in the urine. Therefore, a clearer understanding of the mechanisms involved in the stimulation of ketosis and
EGP are needed.
In the present grant proposal, we will employ innovative study designs with radioisotopes and stable isotopes
to elucidate the mechanisms via which empagliflozin augments hepatic glucose production and stimulates
ketogenesis (Protocols I, II, and III), while in Protocols IV and V we will examine whether pioglitazone can
block the SGLT2i-induced stimulation of ketosis and HGP. If this can be demonstrated, this would allow T1DM,
as well as T2DM, subjects to be safely treated with SGLT2i and to receive the cardiovascular and renal
benefits of this antidiabetic class of drugs."

Quantitative literacy is an essential component of rigorous research. Quantitative literacy incorporates
mathematical knowledge, statistics, reasoning, and data and visual literacies to assign meaning to numerical
data. In scientific research, being quantitatively literate includes being proficient in contextualizing quantitative
datasets and reading and reporting numerical data. Being quantitatively literate is critical to identifying and
avoiding weakness in rigor. Our team will design engaging, clear content for the purposes of providing a
foundational understanding what quantitative literacy is and its role in scientific rigor, developing strategies and
practices in interpreting, analyzing and contextualizing numerical data analysis, and educating learners on best
practices in reporting numerical data to promote scientific rigor. Our educational design invites novice,
intermediate and advanced learners to review and interact with quantitative literacy concepts through five
different learning units. Users have the option to progress through the units covering foundational principles of
quantitative literacy, practices in contextualizing data, interpreting statistics, evaluating and utilizing illustrative
reports and reporting quantitative data, or can acquire knowledge through independent activities, catering to
individualize learning needs. Our expertise and practice in quantitative literacy as well as in building

Social connections are critical to human well-being, and people lacking in these connections (social isolation)
or who perceive that they are lacking these connections (loneliness) have lower self-management of chronic
disease, are more likely to suffer from substance abuse disorders and depression, and are at higher risk for
premature mortality. People living with HIV report a significant burden of loneliness and other indicators of
impaired social connectedness; these impaired social connections have been linked to reduced HIV adherence
and quality of life. The significant strain imposed on social relationships by COVID-19 restrictions and by
losses of family, friends, and community has brought urgency to the issue of social connections, particularly for
vulnerable populations such as those living with HIV infection. COVID-19 has also brought increased calls for
implementation of interventions focused on social connections, which in turn has highlighted a critical lack of
effective interventions in this area, rooted in evidence gaps regarding relationships between social connection
and health outcomes in diverse populations, in understanding of the unique and synergistic influences of
conceptually distinct dimensions of social connection on health over time, and on modifiable pathways linking
these connections to health outcomes. Applying a longitudinal, mixed-methods, and community-engaged
framework within a nationally-representative and well-characterized HIV cohort study, the MACS/WIHS
Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), this project aims to: (Aim 1) characterize longitudinal and multidimensional
patterns of social connection both prior to and during the COVID-era, and identify social, behavioral and
genomic predictors of these patterns; (Aim 2) identify relationships between patterns of social connection and
HIV outcomes, including identification of mechanistic pathways via substance use disorders and depression,
and (Aim 3) assess multilevel mediators and moderators of relationships between social connection and
temporally associated outcomes including area-level socio-geographic indicators of poverty and population
density. This work utilizes the extensive platform of the MWCCS, including annual laboratory evaluation of HIV
disease indices, validated medication adherence measures, genome-wide data that will be utilized to construct
polygenic risk scores, annually updated geocoded data, and diagnostic assessments of substance use
disorders and depression (N=2000). To this, we will add an annual battery of social connection measures,
including social and emotional loneliness, social isolation, and social integration at selected MWCCS sites
(N=735), coupled with nested, longitudinal qualitative interviews (N=40). This multidimensional, longitudinal
and multilevel analysis will significantly extend previous research in this area, and findings from this project can
be utilized to identify actionable targets to support the design of effective interventions in this important area
and high priority population."

Effective therapeutic interventions are needed to stem the alarming increases in non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD) in Mexican-American men, an understudied population at greater risk for the development of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Primary lifestyle risk factors for NAFLD include physical inactivity and sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption, characteristics that are highly evidenced in Mexican-American men. The
risk of NAFLD is further increased in Mexican-American men by a greater frequency (up to 55%) of the risk
allele at the PNPLA3 (patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein) gene. This allele confers a
substantially greater susceptibility to NAFLD and HCC. In the absence of FDA-approved pharmaceutical
agents, lifestyle modification, including weight loss initiated by improvements in dietary and physical activity
behavior, is the recommended therapy for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Lifestyle interventions
targeting modest weight loss (approximately 5% body weight) have been shown to result in significant
reductions in liver fat. However, evidence regarding the effects of a lifestyle intervention designed exclusively
for Mexican-American men at greater risk for NAFLD is not currently available. Dr. David Garcia has an
excellent foundation in lifestyle interventions that has positioned him well to advance toward his goal of
reducing obesity-related disease burden in Mexican-American males. The goal of this NIMHD K01 Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award is to provide Dr. Garcia with an in-depth understanding of metabolic
and pathogenic pathways and risk factors of obesity-related cancers and related diseases, with a specific focus
on NAFLD and HCC in Mexican-American men. He also will gain training in non-invasive imaging biomarkers
(e.g., transient elastography) for the evaluation and management of disease state and risk factors. Lastly, he
will advance his knowledge and skill development in research methodologies (e.g., quantitative analysis and
qualitative inquiry) that informs on the design and tailoring of a culturally-specific study to reduce the burden of
NAFLD. With the mentorship of Dr. Cynthia Thomson and Dr. Michael Fallon, co-mentors, and collaborators;
for the proposed project Dr. Garcia intends to 1) use an available dataset from the Cameron County Hispanic
Cohort (CCHC) to assess risk for NAFLD, including the influence of phenotypic factors (lifestyle behaviors) in
Mexican-American men; 2) evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of obesity-related cancer risk, with
an emphasis on NAFLD and HCC risk in Mexican-American men; and 3) assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and preliminary efficacy of a NAFLD-specific weight loss intervention tailored for Mexican-American men. The
training plan and research strategy in this K01 application will afford Dr. Garcia the time, resources, and
mentorship necessary to achieve his career goal which is enthusiastically endorsed by University of Arizona
leaders and an extremely appropriate and supportive research environment."

Immunotherapy has shown the capacity to improve outcomes for some patients across a wide-range of
malignancies. However, many patients still do not achieve clinical benefit and in particular, patients with liver
metastases demonstrate poor responsiveness to immunotherapy. Emerging evidence suggest a role for the liver
in determining outcomes with cancer immunotherapy. To this end, the liver is a critical determinant of immune
regulation and plays a central role in T cell peripheral tolerance. Yet, how the liver may regulate immunotherapy
efficacy is unclear. This represents a significant gap in our knowledge that has strong translational implications.
In gastrointestinal malignancies, the liver may be continuously exposed to malignant cells as well as soluble
factors and antigens released by primary tumors. We hypothesize that this connection between the gut and liver
may have significant implications on T cell immunosurveillance in cancer. In support of this hypothesis, we have
found that primary tumors release soluble factors that activate hepatocytes in the liver. This process can begin
during the earliest stages of cancer development. Activated hepatocytes respond by releasing acute phase
reactants which act to orchestrate an immunological niche environment in the liver that is underpinned by the
recruitment of neutrophils and myeloid cells and the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In the setting of
hepatocyte activation, primary tumor development, occurring in the pancreas, demonstrates poor T cell
infiltration. However, genetic blockade of hepatocyte activation converts a T cell “cold” tumor into a “hot” tumor.
This finding underscores the importance of the liver in regulating T cell immunosurveillance in cancer. Our priority
is to decipher mechanisms by which the liver regulates T cell immunosurveillance in cancer and to understand
its implications in regulating the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will define
mechanisms by which hepatocytes direct tumor immune evasion with a focus on signaling pathways regulated
by hepatocytes and their impact on T cell priming and trafficking. In Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of
hepatocyte activation on the immunobiology of PDAC and the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Together, these
complementary aims will inform the development of novel treatment paradigms designed to curtail the
immunosuppressive effects of liver inflammation as a strategy to broaden the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy."

Sensory abnormalities are commonly observed in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In early
interactions with caregivers, visual, auditory, and somatosensory processing is integral to social interchanges
and helps direct attention toward important cues. The integration of sensory information aids in detecting salient
features of the external environment. In ASD, however, there is evidence of atypical multisensory integration and
disrupted salience processing. Ineffective integration and saliency detection of sensory information likely
contribute to cognitive and emotional overload and uncertainty, and increased stress reactivity. Elevated stress
(e.g., cortisol) associated with sensory dysfunction in ASD may further compound core symptomatology and
contribute to later development of internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety) frequently co-occurring in ASD. Sensory
abnormalities are often correlated with internalizing symptoms in ASD children, although the underlying neural
and behavioral mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, this research project will investigate the relationship
between multisensory integration, salience processing, and stress reactivity, and establish how abnormalities in
these domains are associated with internalizing symptoms in ASD. These relations will be examined in ASD
children (n=115) and typically developing peers (n=115) between 7 and 10 years of age, when complex
multisensory integration begins to stabilize and risk of developing internalizing symptoms increases. We theorize
that deficits in low-level sensory processing disrupt both high-level multisensory integration and saliency
detection, which are linked to internalizing symptoms; we further hypothesize these links to be moderated by
stress reactivity in ASD. The proposed research aims to: (1) characterize multisensory integration in the context
of saliency detection of sensory information in children with ASD; (2) map activity and functional connectivity of
the neural circuits underlying multisensory integration and salience processing; (3) examine associations
between subjective measures of reported sensory responsivity, quantitative measures of multisensory
integration and saliency detection, and stress reactivity; and (4) relate neural and behavioral measures of
multisensory integration and salience processing, as well as indices of stress reactivity, to co-occurring
internalizing symptoms reported in children with ASD. This project will implement a multimodal approach,
including the collection of quantitative psychophysical discrimination response thresholds (to visual, auditory,
somatosensory, and multisensory stimulation), biological indicators of stress reactivity (i.e., salivary cortisol),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (i.e., task and resting state functional connectivity MRI, anatomical
MRI), subjective caregiver-report questionnaires, and cognitive and psychodiagnostic assessments. The findings
will elucidate the links between neurobiobehavioral mechanisms underpinning multisensory integration, salience
processing, and manifestations of stress, as well as internalizing conditions in children with autism."

Most premature infants experience extrauterine growth restriction for reasons that are unclear and are at in-
creased lifelong risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our long-term goal is to identify mechanisms that diminish
lean growth and alter metabolic responses to nutrition in preterm infants; these findings will inform the develop-
ment of new nutritional strategies to improve outcomes. The objective of this application is to determine if per-
sistence of the anabolic resistance to feeding following premature birth impairs lean growth and if specific amino
acid supplementation ameliorates lean mass accretion. The central hypothesis is that prematurity limits lean
growth by blunting amino acid- and insulin-induced stimulation of protein synthesis and myonuclear accretion in
skeletal muscle but can be improved by amino acid supplementation targeted to promote mechanistic target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent cellular processes. The hypothesis is based on data from the ap-
plicants’ laboratories and supported by the literature. The rationale is that understanding the fundamental mech-
anisms by which prematurity alters the anabolic response to nutrition is essential to inform and modify feeding
practices for preterm infants to sustain intrauterine growth rates of lean mass after they are born. The hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine if the acute protein anabolic resistance to feeding in
the preterm is sustained long-term and results in reduced muscle and lean mass accretion; and 2) Determine if
supplementation with leucine and/or the arginine precursor, citrulline enhances lean growth by upregulating
mTORC1-dependent muscle protein synthesis and myonuclear accretion. When pigs born preterm and term
reach ages equivalent to human late-infancy or late-childhood, we will determine body composition, growth rate,
energy expenditure, hormone, substrate and metabolite profiles, and skeletal muscle protein synthesis and deg-
radation rates, blood flow, amino acid, insulin and eNOS signaling, metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles, and
satellite cell abundance and proliferation in response to feeding, pancreatic-substrate clamps, and supplemen-
tation with leucine and/or citrulline. The methods are established in the applicants’ laboratories. The approach is
innovative because it will use comprehensive approaches that will examine concurrently in vivo responses to
preterm birth of the principal processes that regulate muscle growth, i.e., protein synthesis, protein degradation,
and myonuclear accretion, and how these processes respond to dietary interventions targeted to promote anab-
olism. The proposed studies are unique because they comprehensively examine in a relevant preterm model
the mechanisms that underlie the anabolic resistance of the premature which limits lean growth and examine
the effectiveness of targeted amino acid supplementation on processes that regulate skeletal muscle growth.
The proposed research is significant because it will advance our understanding of how prematurity impacts the
anabolic response of skeletal muscle to nutrition. The results will provide novel information to optimize the nutri-
tional management of preterm infants to improve their long-term metabolic health and growth."
10908651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Within every brain region, neurons can be classified into dozens or hundreds of different cell types, each with unique functional roles and unique impacts on disease states. Traditionally, in vivo electrophysiological recordings—which have made invaluable contributions to our understanding of the neural basis of behavior— have not been able to distinguish the activity of genetically defined cell types. Despite recent advances in our ability to measure action potentials from many neurons simultaneously, it remains difficult to connect these spike trains to underlying cell types and all that is known about their morphology, connectivity patterns, and intrinsic properties. Here, we propose to extend the widely used Neuropixels platform by creating a version of these probes that is capable of both high-density electrophysiological recording and multi-color light delivery. This device, called Neuropixels Opto, could be used to identify cell types through an approach known as “optotagging,” while also facilitating precise manipulations of genetically defined neural populations. We will work with IMEC, a nanoelectronics R&D organization with exclusive access to world-class fabrication facilities, to design and build a fully integrated implantable recording device with 1280 electrical readout sites, up to 48 red light emitters, and up to 62 blue light emitters. A proof-of-concept version of this probe has already been delivered to the Allen Institute, where it was successfully used in an optotagging experiment. However, more work is required to develop a device that can be manufactured at scale and sold for around $2500/probe, in order to facilitate its dissemination throughout the systems neuroscience community. In collaboration with three external test sites, we will validate the efficacy of Neuropixels Opto for performing cell-type-specific recordings and manipulations in four brain regions: the visual cortex, entorhinal cortex, striatum, and the ventral tegmental area. In addition, we will extend popular data acquisition packages by developing modules for controlling these probes, as well as create new transgenic mouse lines that make it much simpler for users to carry out dual-color optogenetic manipulations. Taken together, these efforts will make Neuropixels Opto a powerful, accessible, and indispensable tool for understanding the role that different cell types play in living brains."
10901916,"Abstract Physical resilience is a predictor of healthy aging (Competitive renewal)
The ability to respond to and recover from a physically stressful event is defined as physical resilience. The
inherent individual variation in response to a physical stressor suggests that different stressors trigger different
stress response patterns. A deeper understanding as to why some individuals maintain or regain function
following an insult, while others do not, may help to characterize protective factors that can be engaged to
promote resilience and healthy aging. We have developed and partially characterized three translationally
relevant physical stressors in mice: acute sleep disruption (ASD), the chemotherapeutic drug
cyclophosphamide (CYP), and acute cutaneous trauma (ACT), that trigger responses showing a correlation
with physiological and pathological features associated with increasing age. We have shown in the first grant
period that ASD, CYP, and ACT administered to middle-aged mice results in a range of responsiveness from
low to high, such that mice can be categorized as resistant or susceptible and aligned with phenotypic and
geropathologic parameters of aging. The hypothesis of the competitive renewal is that resilience to aging
is characterized by heterogeneous response patterns unique to defined physical stressors in an age-
dependent manner. Aim 1 is designed to validate physiological targets of ASD, CYP, and ACT.
Responsiveness will be determined by readout assays (escape times in a learning task for ASD, neutrophil to
lymphocyte ratio for CYP, and biopsy healing area for ACT) in middle aged mice as resistant or susceptible to
each physical stressor. Each group of mice will then be followed to older age and aligned with phenotypic
aging endpoints including assessments for memory, strength and agility. Aim 2 is designed to confirm organ-
based targets of ASD, CYP, and ACT in tissues from Aim 1 mice using endpoints based on differences in
geropathology lesion scores in specific organs from the two groups. Digital imaging and biostatistical
paradigms for mouse PathoClock analyses will be used for evaluation of organ-specific and organ-common
geropathology data. Aim 3 is designed to identify and characterize molecular pathways of ASD, CYP, and ACT
in tissues from Aim 1 mice and employ RNA seq for transcriptomic pathway analysis followed by verification
with nanoscale protein analytical platforms and immunohistochemistry imaging for molecular analysis of
relevant pathways in stress resistant and stress susceptible mice. The data can then be aligned with data from
Aims 1 and 2. Investigations into the molecular pathways utilized by cells in a particular tissue and organ in
response to a physical stressor would be of merit in individuals predicted to be less resilient to aging and would
have impactful significance for designing clinical studies to enhance healthy aging."

Brief and low-cost family history-based screening assessments to identify families at high risk for BRCA-
associated cancers have been endorsed by national guidelines (e.g., USPSTF) and public health organizations
(e.g., CDC). Public health departments offer an infrastructure for systematically reaching women historically left
out of cancer genomic advances (e.g., uninsured, Black women, rural residents). Georgia is among the few states
to have implemented statewide family history screening for BRCA-associated cancers. Despite its potential,
current clinic-based approaches that identify at risk women are not sustainable and show limited reach.
Additionally, uptake of follow-up cancer screening is suboptimal and solely focuses on women screened as high
genetic risk. Therefore, we propose a two-phase study to adapt Georgia’s existing statewide family history
screening program and evaluate its effectiveness to increase the number and diversity of women who receive
family history assessment and the opportunity to access risk-stratified follow-up services. Guided by the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework, the aims of this two-phase study
are: Phase I (Exploration & Preparation stages), Aim 1: Conduct a multilevel adaptation of GA CORE’s existing
statewide family history screening program for BRCA-associated cancers to maximize sustainable program reach
and improve communication suitability and effectiveness. Phase II (Implementation stage), Aim 2: Use a multi-
site, parallel group, cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate effectiveness of the adapted program relative
to the current screening program in promoting uptake of family history screening and correct screening result
interpretation among women ages 25 and older who are receiving care in up to 6 of 14 Public Health Clinics in
Southwest Georgia. Secondary outcomes include the uptake of appropriate risk-stratified screening (e.g., high
risk: genetic consultation and testing; low risk: appropriate breast imaging screening). Aim 3: Use the RE-AIM
(Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework to conduct an implementation
research evaluation to measure program process indicators (e.g., reach, fidelity, barriers/facilitators) that may
influence program implementation and sustainability. Our application will be among the first to evaluate a
sustainable multi-level population-based approach to implement evidence-based cancer genetic screening and
to increase the likelihood for fair distribution of genomic advances among diverse populations in rural areas."

This study tests the effectiveness of a youth leadership and civic engagement program with a mindfulness component in improving the mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) health of youth of color and their civic participation and leadership skills. Specifically, we examine whether the Leadership, Engagement, and youth Activism Program with Mindfulness (LEAP-M) is a feasible and effective intervention to foster civic engagement and leadership among youth of color, and can consequently improve youth MEB health and well- being. We partner with sites located in Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois. One of these sites is a school desegregation program, allowing us to test the intervention for youth of color who attend schools predominantly enrolling non-Latinx white students (where they are a numerical minority), while the other is in a large urban school district enrolling primarily youth of color (where they are a numerical majority). Our prior research has demonstrated that addressing structural and social systems is essential to improving MEB health for youth of color. Therefore, the LEAP-M intervention was designed in partnership with youth to facilitate opportunities for awareness of political institutions, social issues, and the role they play in their communities to develop civic participation and leadership, and peer relations, and to improve their wellbeing. LEAP-M integrates training in mindfulness throughout the intervention to support youth in their leadership and civic engagement work. Our long-term goal is to evaluate whether LEAP-M can effectively improve civic skills and the MEB health and well-being of all youth and, specifically, of youth of color. In UG3 Phase 1 we will in Aim
1.1 develop collaborative partnerships with the partner sides, in Aim 1.2 modify the design with partner input and co-create an engagement plan for recruitment and retention, and in Aim 1.3 conduct a pilot study (N=40) to test protocols and refine the methodology with partner feedback. In UH3 Phase 2 we will in Aim 2.1 conduct a two-site 2-arm randomized control trial to test the acceptability and effectiveness of LEAP-M as a mechanism for improving youth MEB health and civic skills (N=504). Youth will be randomly assigned to participate in LEAP-M or in a comparison college and career readiness program of equal duration. In Aim 2.2 we will test whether there is a differential effect of LEAP-M on youth of color, as compared to white students. In Aim 2.3 we will identify potential pathways influencing the link between LEAP-M and youth wellbeing and civic skills. Finally, in Aim 2.4 we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the LEAP-M intervention compared with the college and career readiness program to estimate the potential incremental effects of the intervention. The proposed project is expected to provide research to reduce inequity in MEB health using a civic engagement and mindfulness intervention that, if effective, can be brought to scale."

An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms that regulate alveolar septation and septal wall maturation will be required
to develop therapies for premature infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) and for developing potential therapies
for adult lung regeneration. We and others have begun to define changes in PDGFRa myo, lipo and matrix fibroblast (FB)
function during alveolarization,
homeostasis, regeneration, and fibrosis. Our long-term goal is elucidation of molecular
regulators of FB functions and how diverse FBs support epithelial cells. Our objective herein is to identify molecular mech-
anisms that result in functional changes in alveolar fibroblasts that regulate ECM organization and epithelial differentia-
tion. Integration of transcriptomic datasets predicted GATA6 as a regulator of PDGFRa-FB differentiation. Our preliminary
data show that conditional inactivation of GATA6 in perinatal PDGFRa+ FBs resulted in loss of matrix and gain in lipo fibro-
blast function comparable to findings in BPD and animal models of hyperoxia. GATA6 inactivation in PDGFRa+
FBs also
resulted in fragmented collagen and detachment of AT1 cells from the basal lamina demonstrating a thus far unidentified
role of alveolar FBs in ECM organization. Inactivation of GATA6 resulted in significant increase of the lipo FB transcription
factor TCF21 expression and preliminary in vitro data suggest suppression of TCF21 by GATA6. The central hypothesis is
that GATA6 and transcriptional cofactors regulate FB function in alveolar FBs by suppressing lipo FB differentiation. The
rationale for this research is a new understanding of the regulation of matrix FB function and how these functionally
different stages modify extracellular matrix and the FB-epithelial crosstalk. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that GATA6
suppresses lipo FB function and promotes ECM deposition in the alveolar FBs. This aim will use lineage tracing to deter-
mine trans-differentiation of the alveolar FB to a lipo FB. And use in vitro cell derived matrices to identify ECM modifica-
tions by lipo and matrix FBs. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that GATA6 is in a transcriptional network that regulates lipo
and matrix FB function. In this aim we will use in vitro gain and loss of function of GATA6 and TCF21 and identify and
validate transcriptional networks and partnering transcription factors. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that GATA6 regulates
ECM synthesis and paracrine signaling in PDGFRa+ FBs that direct AT2 to AT1 differentiation. The proposed studies in this
application will identify the transcriptional regulation of matrix FB function and their role in extracellular matrix deposition
and cell-cell signaling in the alveolar niche. The proposed research is conceptually innovative, because we ask questions
regarding the nature of fibroblast plasticity and functional switches. The proposed research is scientifically innovative,
because the contractile function of alveolar fibroblasts, has been thoroughly investigated, but little is known about their
matrix organizing function or
their role in supporting AT2 proliferation and AT1 differentiation This contribution will be
significant because it addresses 1) lack of knowledge of matrix and signaling function of the alveolar FB; 2) identifies and
validates the transcriptional network around GATA6 that regulates FB function."
10861884,"Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose diagnostic challenges in low- and middle-income countries with
high rates of TB disease, due to the well-described impact of paucibacillary disease in children, and current TB
culture and polymerase-chain reaction tests are of limited usefulness due to cost, restricted availability, and
poor sensitivity in specimens available from younger children. Our team of experts from Tulane, Johns
Hopkins University, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, and Asociación Benéfica Prisma have confronted
all of these challenges through more than 25 years of collaboration in Peru and Bolivia. Our goal is to directly
address the challenges of TB in children by evaluating a new diagnostic approach developed by MPI Tony Hu
at Tulane University using a CRISPR-mediated TB assay (CRISPR-TB) optimized to detect circulating
Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell-free DNA (Mtb-cfDNA), and used to analyze cryopreserved serum in pilot
studies from adults and children with presumptive TB, their asymptomatic household contacts, and a cohort of
symptomatic children living with HIV (CLHIV) at high risk for TB. Results from symptomatic adult cohorts
yielded a pooled sensitivity of 93%; specificity of 93%; positive predictive value of 95%; and negative predictive
value of 92%. In limited pilot studies in CLHIV CRISPR-TBD results accurately identified all confirmed TB
(13/13) and most children with unconfirmed TB (80%; 52/65). We propose to enroll 200 presumptive TB
cases and an equal number of well control subjects in each of 2 study populations (test population and
validation population) identified through clinics associated with the “Dr. Mario Ortiz Suarez” Children's Hospital
in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. We will determine the distribution of cfDNA concentrations in peripheral blood in a “test
population” composed of two age-based groups of children (2 months-6 years, 7-14 years) with respiratory
disease grouped by likelihood of TB based on the NIH consensus case definitions (confirmed TB, unconfirmed
TB, and unlikely TB) and in age-matched controls grouped by presence of latent TB infection (LTBI), with
cfDNA measured serially in time among TB cases receiving antibiotic therapy. We will also validate standard
ranges of quantitative cfDNA established for clinical subgroups of children with TB disease or LTBI in an
independent validation cohort. An additional aim will determine the correlation between quantitative cfDNA and
quantitative imaging-based TB scores based on evidence of disease in the lung, the primary target organ in TB
disease, by (1) chest radiograph, measured by computer-aided analysis using the CAD4TB v7 system, and by
(2) lung ultrasound, performed with a portable/low-cost probe assisted by machine learning algorithms for
automatic interpretation. These biomarkers will be tested as potential cofactors that may be combined with
cfDNA levels in peripheral blood, to improve the detection of TB disease in children. The results of this study
will be the first step in a process to find a path to allow detection of the many “unconfirmed” TB cases and
ideally make the diagnosis of pediatric TB in reach for low resource settings where it is so critically needed."
10857231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Repair after injury is a fundamental biologic process that is critical for maintaining lung health. Fibroblasts must
perform key pro-repair functions after injury including proliferation and synthesis of new extracellular matrix,
particularly collagens, that scaffold wound closure. Dead cells (collectively termed cell corpses) are produced
during lung injury and inflammation and have been shown to promote the transition from inflammation to repair.
Prior research has focused on understanding macrophage interactions with apoptotic corpses. However, non-
professional phagocytes including fibroblasts can also interact with cell corpses and the consequence of these
interactions in the lung has not been studied. This proposal seeks to address unknowns regarding fibroblast-
corpse interactions and their role in healthy lung repair. We have found that recognition of cell corpses by
fibroblasts causes fibroblasts to increase collagen protein synthesis. Our preliminary data support a mechanism
where the phosphatidylserine receptor Axl binds cells corpses, activates polyamine metabolite synthesis,
increasing intracellular spermidine levels, which fuel hypusination. Hypusination occurs on a single protein: the
ribosomal subunit eiF5a. When hypusinated, eiF5a is able to stabilize translation of poly-proline-repeat proteins
including collagen. Hypusination is also important for cell proliferation. Blocking polyamine synthesis prevented
hypusination of eiF5a in response to corpse recognition. Blocking Axl or hypusine-eiF5a prevented the increase
in collagen in response to corpse recognition. We also show that, in vivo, hypusine-eiF5a is increased in
fibroblasts after lung injury and that collagen deposition and alveolar-capillary repair are reduced when
hypusination is blocked with the inhibitor GC7 or through targeted deletion of the hypusination enzyme
deoxyhypusine synthase in fibroblasts. This led us to hypothesize that interaction of fibroblasts with cell corpses
is a central cue that activates fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis following lung injury, facilitating
repair. We will use three aims to test if 1) corpse recognition via Axl triggers a translationally-regulated increase
in collagen protein, 2) corpse recognition drives polyamine synthesis that increases spermidine that increases
hypusine-eiF5a and stabilizes collagen translation, and 3) to fully activate pro-repair programming fibroblasts
require the ability to sense corpses via Axl, synthesize polyamines via ornithine decarboxylase, and hypusinate
eiF5a via deoxyhypusine synthase in order to proliferate and synthesize new extracellular matrix after lung injury."
10915567,"OCT-based functional biomarkers for degenerative diseases of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid
neurovascular unit
Abstract: Important diseases of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid neurovascular unit include age-related macular
degeneration (AMD), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and other inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs). The number of people
with AMD worldwide is nearly 200 million, and expected to approach 300 million over the next twenty years, while IRDs
affect more than 5 million more. AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the industrialized world, and also the leading
cause of blindness among people over the age of 60. Standard treatments exist for neither the more prevalent dry form of
AMD nor IRDs, and key obstacles to discovering them are 1) limited understanding of the pathogenic steps leading to
vision loss; and 2) lack of biomarkers for disease progression and recovery. In recent years our team has pioneered the
emerging field of optoretinography (ORG) using adaptive optics (AO) and OCT. The ORG is an all-optical, noninvasive,
objective measure of neural function in the retina, and has the potential to yield new functional biomarkers of retinal
disease. Due to the cost and complexity of AO-OCT imaging systems and their subsequent scarcity, ORG measurements
have been made only in small numbers of volunteers, mostly without retinal disease. We propose to develop a
next-generation, proto-clinical ORG system and characterize its sensitivity, dynamic range, and spatial resolution. First,
we will test a number of modifications to the protocols for imaging and signal processing, with a focus on improving the
clinical utility of the method. Second, in healthy subjects and several patient populations we will measure ORG responses,
along with other OCT-based measurements such as structural OCT imaging and OCTA. The patient populations to be
studied are: 1) IRD patients including those with Stargardt’s disease and retinitis pigmentosa; 2) intermediate AMD
patients with drusen, subretinal drusenoid deposits, and/or hyperreflective foci; and 3) late AMD patients with regions of
geographic atrophy. The motivations for these patient populations are 1) to test hypotheses about the mechanisms
underlying the ORG response, and 2) to demonstrate the ORG’s capacity to detect and quantify disease-related
dysfunction. The proposed work will result in 1) a clinically useful ORG platform (also capable of structural and
angiographic imaging), and 2) new knowledge that will permit us to design ORG- and OCT-based biomarkers for retinal
disease that relate to mechanisms of action and have characterized sensitivity to photoreceptor dysfunction."
10909319,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Over the course of the development and into adulthood, the human brain builds neural circuits composed of
thousands of types of neurons. As new neurons are born, they are incorporated into developing and existing
circuits making connections to neurons that are nearby as well as neurons that are in distant parts of the brain.
Many neurological conditions are related to the improper growth of networks in the brain. Yet, we lack a basic
understanding of how neural circuits change as new neurons join. To address this question, this proposal uses
a novel animal model, the mollusc, Berghia stephanieae, in which it is possible to construct a cellular- and
synaptic-level wiring diagram of the entire brain at several juvenile stages as well as the adult. Using these whole
brain connectomes, the project will track the changes in specific neurons, in neural circuits, and in whole brain
networks as the number of neurons in the brain increases by over 40-fold.
 Neurons will be identified by intersectional labeling of gene expression using sets of up to five in situ
hybridization chain reaction probes that label different mRNA sequences. Overlapping sets of probes will used
so that individually identifiable neurons and neuron types can be distinguished based on their patterns of gene
expression combined with their soma location and size. Additionally, in adult animals, neurons will be labeled
using fluorescent tracers applied to nerves emanating from the brain. Machine learning (ML) will be employed to
classify neuronal types based on all of these features. ML classifications of neurons across developmental
stages will be corrected by humans to enhance the predictive power of the ML.
 A series of connectomes of the brains of an adult and juveniles from four stages will be constructed. The
brain will be serially sectioned. Each of the 30 nm thick sections will be imaged using a 61 beam scanning
electron microscope. The sections will be aligned and all neurons will be automatically reconstructed in 3D. The
reconstructions will include all axons, dendrites, and synapses. Again, humans will proofread the results to
correct the ML algorithm. The result will be five complete brain connectomes spanning from the early juvenile
with 500 neurons to the mature adult with over 23,000 neurons.
 The developmental series will be analyzed to test hypotheses about the organization and development of
neurons, neural circuits, and entire brain networks. Changes in neural structure of identified neurons will be
tracked over development. Comparisons will be made between neural types as new neurons are added.
Complete neural circuitry for visual, olfactory, and motor systems will be determined. Finally, the project will
determine whether hubs develop around the oldest neurons or whether the network scales without concentrating
connectivity at particular hubs. The results will provide an unprecedented look at how the synaptic networks of
neurons across an entire brain change as new neurons are added."
10884389,"A novel cartridge-based sequencing solution for decentralized M. tuberculosis resistance detection
Rifampin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) is one of the principal causes of death associated with antimicrobial
resistance. Newer all oral bedaquiline-containing RR-TB regimens, now recommended worldwide, will shorten
treatment and improve outcomes. However, the lack of timely drug susceptibility data due to the slow growth
rate of M. tuberculosis and the need for high containment biological laboratories are major barriers to scale-up
of bedaquiline and other new and repurposed drugs. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra and other commercial molecular TB
tests can identify rifampin resistance, but cannot inform complete treatment regimens because they are limited
to analyzing only a small number of genetic loci (i.e., “hot spots”). Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS)
is able to sequence entire genes rapidly without need for culture, and therefore could transform RR-TB clinical
management. Achieving near-patient clinical application, however, has two major bottlenecks: (1) a complex,
unstandardized workflow for preparing clinical samples for NGS, and (2) the cost and infrastructure
requirements of industry-standard Illumina platforms. Partnering with global TB diagnostics leader Cepheid, we
address these barriers by utilizing the ultrasonication, microfluidics, and thermocycler capabilities of the
existing Xpert Ultra cartridge, already in use in over 180 countries, to unite a vetted direct-sample-to-answer
system with a nanopore gene sequencing platform for the first time. Xpert CartSeq, a pioneering cartridge-
based sequencing solution suitable for lower levels of healthcare, achieves robust DNA extraction and
sophisticated library preparation while minimizing user variability and mitigating technical skill requirements.
Through its development as detailed in this proposal, we aim to catalyze the clinical application of NGS in high
burden settings."

Lens shape is a primary determinant of its optical power and accommodative ability. Growth-induced
change in lens shape directly causes presbyopia and is a known risk factor for age-related cataract.
However, the biomechanical factors which interact to govern age-related changes in lens shape remain
unknown. In the proposed study, we will systematically characterize the biomechanical properties of the
aging human lens and use that information to understand how the lens shape evolves with age. A novel
theory of constrained soft tissue growth will be employed to account for the presence of the lens capsule
and its influence on the volumetric expansion of the lens fiber cell compartment. The biomechanical
interaction between the fiber cell compartment and the capsule ultimately dictates the shape of the lens.
These interactions behave like a water balloon filled with gelatin: as the gelatin sets, the properties of the
gelatin contribute more and more to the shape of the balloon."
10886823,"Abstract
Microglia (MG), the resident innate immune cells of the brain, play a critical role in the inflammatory response to
stroke. Stroke predominantly affects older individuals. Unfortunately, with aging, MG become increasingly
dysfunctional and, in conjunction with other cell types in the brain, contribute to worse outcome following stroke.
However, the role of MG in the stroke brain is not exclusively bad, as MG also contribute to repair and recovery
following stroke. Thus, the selective regulation of the MG inflammatory response at specific times in the aged
brain could be of great therapeutic value for stroke patients.
Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis (scRNAseq), we discovered a gene (interferon alpha-inducible protein
27-like protein 2A; Ifi27l2a) that was selectively and highly upregulated in aged MG and further upregulated in
MG following stroke. Our initial analysis showed a positive correlation between Ifi27l2a expression and specific
sets of pro-inflammatory cytokine and senescence-related genes. These and other studies suggested that
Ifi27l2a might play a critical regulatory role in promoting the inflammatory response of MG in the post-stroke
brain of mice. Analysis of human brain samples also showed increased expression of IFI27L2 (human isoform)
in stroke brain, enhancing the translational relevance of our findings. Next, to define the functional role of Ifi27l2a,
we performed a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, which established a compelling causative role of
Ifi27l2a in promoting MG proinflammatory function and in worsening stroke injury. We also established the
potential for Ifi27l2a overexpression to induce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression/activity and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) production, which are two driving factors in blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Finally,
using a mouse stroke model, we showed that partial deletion of Ifi27l2a (Ifi27l2a+/- mice) led to significantly
improved outcome, as evidenced by reduced infarct volume and reduced microglial activation. Together, these
data provide the first direct evidence for Ifi27l2a in modulating MG functionality and brain injury following stroke
and establish Ifi27l2a-dependent signaling as a new therapeutic target.
Our proposed aims will test the overall hypothesis that increased MG Ifi27l2a contributes to an exaggerated
inflammatory response to ischemic stroke in the aged brain and that reducing MG Ifi27l2a expression can
attenuate neuroinflammation, reduce BBB disruption, and improve outcome following stroke. If successful, these
studies will lay the foundation for a novel strategy based on the selective attenuation of MG pro-inflammatory
signaling in the treatment of stroke or other pathologies associated with neuroinflammation."
10922786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microscopic colitis is the most common cause of chronic watery diarrhea in older adults. The symptoms of this
disease are debilitating. Patients describe isolation and withdrawal from social life and activities. Treatment is
limited to expensive therapies that are sometimes ineffective. Disease relapse is common after medications
are stopped. Although the incidence is comparable to inflammatory bowel disease, the disease has received
much less research attention. A number of medications (PPIs, NSAIDs, statins, SSRIs) have been linked with
microscopic colitis. Although guidelines suggest discontinuing these medications as the initial step in
treatment, the evidence supporting this recommendation is weak. The first phase of this study enrolled patients
with microscopic colitis and diarrhea controls. Contrary to existing beliefs, there was no association with
medications previously linked to microscopic colitis. There was a strong inverse association with obesity and
exogenous hormones. Amplicon sequencing by 16S rRNA demonstrated that microbiome alpha-diversity was
significantly lower in microscopic colitis cases compared to controls. Several taxa were enriched in cases. The
present study is designed to extend and expand on the initial findings. The aims of the proposed case-control
study are: 1) To investigate medications, oral contraceptives, postmenopausal hormones and obesity by
comparing microscopic colitis cases to two comparison groups – patients referred for colonoscopy for diarrhea
and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. 2) To use shotgun metagenomic sequencing to gain insight
into biodiversity and function. 3) To use RNA sequencing of mucosal samples from microscopic colitis patients,
diarrhea controls and screening controls to reveal genetic signatures associated with microscopic colitis and
discover potential druggable disease targets. The study will enroll 150 microscopic colitis cases, 300 diarrhea
controls and 300 screening colonoscopy controls. Biopsies from the colon will be used to evaluate adherent
bacterial organisms and to conduct RNAseq experiments in 100 microscopic colitis cases, 100 diarrhea
controls and 100 screening colonoscopy controls. Structured telephone interviews will obtain detailed dietary,
medication and lifestyle information on study subjects. The prospective data collection corrects important
limitations of prior research by others. The addition of a second control group could provide more definitive
evidence to avoid unnecessarily stopping therapeutically important medications (PPIs, NSAIDs, statins,
SSRIs). Shotgun metagenomics could provide information on microbial etiology or functional genes potentially
leading to strategies to prevent or treat the disease. The study will improve our understanding of risk factors,
set the stage for more scientifically grounded future research, and potentially suggest new interventions for a
disease that is currently poorly understood."

Recent advances in molecular technologies have enhanced our ability to identify genetic forms of
hearing losses with several important consequences. First, the incorporation of genetic testing
into diagnostic algorithms has improved clinical care for deaf/hard-of-hearing persons. As more
deafness-associated genes are identified and incorporated into these panels, further
improvements in clinical care will follow. Second, because the genetic spectrum of non-syndromic
hearing loss (NSHL) has been better defined, epidemiological studies of genetic deafness are
possible. These studies can be used to define knowledge gaps in our understanding of genetic
hearing loss. Third, the identification of genes required for normal auditory function provides
insight into inner ear physiology at the molecular level. This insight is foundational to the
development of novel therapies to treat deafness. During the 09/01/2014-08/31/2019 grant period,
we built on prior successes to advance our understanding of NSHL by focusing on two specific
aims.
• Specific Aim 1: To identify genetic variants in regulatory elements of deafness-associated
 genes that contribute to NSHL
• Specific Aim 2. To compare simple and complex haplotypes in two well-defined populations –
 one with age-related hearing loss (ARHL) and one with normal hearing – to identify whether
 common variants in deafness-associated genes contribute to ARHL
In this competitive renewal, our overarching goals are to further improve the clinical care of persons
with hearing loss and provide a more robust foundation for therapies that target specific types of
genetic hearing loss. We will achieve these goals by addressing current knowledge gaps as
reflected in the following specific aims:
• Specific Aim 1: We will identify novel deafness-associated genes
 Hypothesis: By leveraging whole genome sequencing and structured bioinformatic analyses in
 carefully selected cohorts, we will optimize our ability to identify novel deafness-associated
 genes. The role of these genes in the biology of hearing and deafness will be validated using
 animals models of hearing loss.
• Specific Aim 2: We will resolve hidden heritability and complexity in known deafness-
 associated genes
 Hypothesis: A wealth of unidentified and unrecognized complexity lies at the variant level in
 known deafness-associated genes. Examples include the unrecognized effect of missense
 variants of low predicted pathogenicity, the pathogenicity of synonymous variants, and the
 pathogenicity of non-coding variants.
The completion of these aims will refine our understanding of the biology of hearing and deafness,
improve clinical care for persons with hearing loss, provide a better genetic foundation for
precision medicine for the hearing impaired, and identify new targets for gene therapy for
deafness."
10733446,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A critical feature of memory is mnemonic discrimination, the ability to distinguish between similar events in our
past and prevent confusion between similar situations. The dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus is a brain
region known to play a central part in this cognitive function. For thirty years, the DG neuronal network has been
hypothesized to support mnemonic discrimination by performing a computation called ""pattern separation"" during
memory encoding. In this view, the role of the DG is to disambiguate upstream cortical representations of similar
events, transforming similar patterns of incoming activity into dissimilar output patterns, before they reach
downstream hippocampal areas to be stored as memories. Computational modelling suggests that the anatomy
and physiology of the DG network could allow DG to perform pattern separation, and recent experimental studies
demonstrated that the isolated DG is able to perform some forms of pattern separation. However, a direct
demonstration that DG performs such computation in vivo remains elusive. Consequently, the central tenet that
pattern separation in DG during memory encoding is the mechanism underlying mnemonic discrimination has
never been directly tested. Moreover, the role of DG during memory retrieval or consolidation is also unclear.
The general goals of this research project are thus to 1) test in vivo whether DG performs pattern separation or
other computations and 2) determine how DG computations during encoding and retrieval support mnemonic
discrimination. Measuring the computations of a network like DG requires knowledge about its simultaneous
inputs and outputs, which has never been achieved in vivo at a single-cell resolution. To resolve this difficulty, I
will use multiplane two-photon calcium imaging in behaving mice in order to simultaneously record activity
dynamics of a large population of DG output neurons and the activity of the cortical axons that target their
dendrites. To investigate the basis of mnemonic discrimination, one needs to compare neuronal representations
of different but similar experiences. To this end, mice trained to navigate in a virtual environment will be placed
in several novel environments of parametrically varied similarity. Experiment-1 will consist of recording DG inputs
and outputs while mice explore a sequence of environments, repeated over several days to determine how
computations evolve as familiarity increases. In experiment-2, an explicit mnemonic component will be added: a
new environment will be associated to a fearful stimulus and the ability of individual mice to discriminate this
context from another similar but neutral one will be measured. This will allow to determine what computations
are performed by DG during encoding and recall and how they relate to context discrimination: if the theory is
correct, the degree of pattern separation during encoding should correlate to the amount of discrimination.
Finally, the analysis of this rich dataset will help constrain more detailed theories of episodic memory, an
instrumental step towards understanding memory impairments symptomatic of numerous cognitive disorders."

corporation and Tribal Organization and supports Center activities via community and tribal participation and
assessment, K-12 programming, and workforce development. These education, outreach, and
evaluative activities ensure that our Center's work, driven by Alaska Native Tribes, has meaningful and lasting
impacts. To achieve our first aim, evaluating impact, we create a Community Voices Panel to assess program
effectiveness, integrate local knowledge, and develop useful education materials, fact sheets, infographics,
and other culturally appropriate outreach to share data and findings. For our second aim, K-12 programming,
we create uniform educational materials to be used in classrooms across the Gulf of Alaska, particularly in
smaller and more remote communities, that increase education and understanding of HAB's, PSTs, and toxin
risks and promote safe harvesting practices. For our third aim, workforce development, we support interest and
career pathways to marine sciences by offering training and experiential learning experiences for college

10931631,"It has been known for some time that development of the visual system can be an adaptive
process in which light exposure or visual experience modifies the final structure. Here we
propose to investigate a developmental pathway in which photoreception via OPN4 in
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) regulates rod photoreceptor
survival. Preliminary data show that light and OPN4 regulate rod precursor cell death in the
neonatal retina and rod number in adult mice. This is mediated by the neuromodulator glutamate.
We suggest that ipRGC outer retinal dendrites (ORDs) deliver glutamate to the outer retina and
regulate rod survival. ORDs are unique to ipRGCs and are transient, existing only during the first
week after birth. Single cell sequencing data reveal that the glutamate receptor Grik3 is expressed
in rod precursors transiently in the first week after birth and is thus a good candidate to mediate
this response. These data suggest the Central Hypothesis that Perinatal light sensing by
ipRGCs regulates rod photoreceptor number via glutamate-induced precursor cell death.
We propose three Aims designed to define the mechanisms underlying this proposed adaptive
response. We will define the developmental time-course of ORDs and assess markers of
glutamate function (Aim 1), assess the proposed relationships in the light-OPN4-Gαq-rod cell
death pathway (Aim 2), and assess glutamate delivery by ipRGC ORDs and the response of rod
precursors (Aim 3). The finding that early developmental light sensing regulates the number
of rod photoreceptors is unexpected and of broad interest because it represents a novel
mechanism and has implications for human eye development."

Reconstruction of plant natural product pathways in genetically well-characterized microbial
organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a sustainable and scalable method of producing
high value pharmaceutical compounds. The family of monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs)
represent a diverse collection of natural product with significant biological activities. MIAs are
indispensable pharmaceutical ingredients, but are also expensive and difficult to isolate from plant
producers. In the previous grant cycle, we successfully engineered yeast strains that can produce
strictosidine, the universal precursor to MIAs, at titers exceeding 100 mg/L. In this proposal, we
will engineer the downstream steps from strictosidine to overcome key metabolic bottlenecks, and
develop new yeast based-technologies for engineering heterologous natural product pathways.
In collaboration with the Di Carlo lab, we will deploy PicoShell enabled cell sorting to enable high
throughput screening of MIA pathways. The PicoShell technology allows microfluidic-based, high
throughput single-cell encapsulation from liquid culture. Encapsulated yeast cells can be grown
in bulk in a monoclonal fashion and produce the compound of interest. PicoShell effectively
amplifies reporter molecule signal from single yeast cells and can be sorted with FACS based on
scatter (growth rate) and fluorescence (titer). Such workflow enables the merging of yeast
pathway engineering with technologies that require high throughput screening, including directed
evolution and genome wide CRISPRi screening. Our preliminary efforts have shown that a
fluorescent natural product in the MIA pathway can serve as a reporter for the efficiency of the
downstream steps during PicoShell enabled FACS sorting. This collaborative proposal will
leverage Tang lab’s expertise in natural product biosynthesis with the new nanobiotechnology
tools developed for yeast by the Di Carlo Lab. This will pave the way for complete reconstitution
of important MIAs at high titers in yeast, as well as establishing new tools for yeast synthetic
biology. Together we will address three aims: 1) overcoming key bottleneck step in post-
strictosidine steps, specifically the low efficiency of strictosidine glucosidase (SGD); 2) host
engineering with CRISPR interference and activation to increase strictosidine levels, using both
rational and genome wide screening enabled by PicoShells; and 3) complete biosynthesis of
complex MIAs ibogaine and mitragynine, two psychoactive MIAs that have generated significant
interests as potential treatment for opioid addiction."

This proposal addresses the challenge of closing the racial disparity gap in breast cancer mortality by identifying
a contributing biological factor and developing therapeutic strategies to overcome its impact. The selenoprotein,
SELENOF, was recently identified as a new tumor suppressor in breast cancer. The broad hypothesis is that
lower SELENOF levels in African American patients contribute to the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality
by driving tumor progression and poor patient outcome. Therefore, therapeutic strategies to mitigate its loss are
needed to help close the disparity gap. The scientific premise for the hypothesis is based on the following: 1) the
genomes of breast tumors from African Americans have a 5-10 fold higher frequency of SELENOF single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which account for lower SELENOF protein levels, 2) SELENOF mRNA
expression is significantly lower in breast tumors from African American patients compared to Caucasians, and
lower SELENOF levels predict shorter survival in these patients, 3) loss of SELENOF in normal breast epithelial
cells resulted in increased proliferation and abrogated cell death, features of cellular transformation, and 4)
overexpression of SELENOF in breast cancer cells induced cell death, blocked proliferation and survival,
enhanced response to therapies, and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4a3 (eIF4a3)
was identified as a translational repressor of SELENOF. The SELENOF locus SNPs are predicted to enhance
eIF4a3’s binding affinity resulting in stronger repression of SELENOF translation. Preliminary data showed that
pharmacologic inhibition of eIF4a3 results in increased SELENOF protein levels and reduced breast cancer cell
viability in a SELENOF-dependent manner. Loss of SELENOF also resulted in hyperactivation of the
kinase/RNase inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), a master regulator of the unfolded protein response. This
rendered cells highly susceptible to IRE1 inhibition, thus identifying a new vulnerability in these cells. Four aims
are proposed: 1) Determine the mechanisms underlying SELENOF-induced cell fate in breast cancer, 2)
Determine whether loss of SELENOF drives tumorigenesis by using African American derived xenografts and a
murine model of breast cancer, 3) Determine the impact of SNPs on the regulation of SELENOF translation by
eIF4a3, and 4) Determine whether eIF4a3 overexpression and the SNPs contribute to reduced SELENOF tumor
levels and poor outcome in African American breast cancer patients. Our work will establish SELENOF as a new
target to reduce racial disparity in breast cancer, and thus support the development of SELENOF-based
therapies. In the clinic, SELENOF’s SNPs and levels can also serve as candidate biomarkers to identify African
American patients at risk of aggressive disease. The distinct therapeutic strategies investigated here are likely
to result in novel and more effective personalized medicine and may help close the disparity gap."

The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a complex network of neural crest-derived neurons and glia responsible
for regulating key intestinal functions including motility, sensation, and secretion. Unfortunately, the ENS is
frequently subject to injury leading to motor and other abnormalities. Often, this leads to debilitating disorders
with few available treatment options. Excitingly, there is now mounting evidence of postnatal ENS injury-induced
neurogenesis. Importantly, through work on adult animal models we have shown that Schwann cells (SC) can
enter the gut alongside the extrinsic nerves and then differentiate into specific neuronal and glial subtypes
(enteric neuro-gliogenesis). Thus, SC provide an unexpected source of cells to repopulate injured neurons and
enteric glia. Furthermore, we have found that microbiome manipulation is a powerful method to induce Schwann
cell-mediated enteric neuro-gliogenesis leading to functional recovery of the ENS and that this is mediated via
the serotonin 5HT4 pathway. However, many aspects of postnatal ENS neuro-gliogenesis are not fully
understood, including the functional impact of the neuro-gliogenesis from the SC, and the therapeutic potential
for 5HT4 manipulation in human disease aiming for an enhanced SC-induced neuro-glial regeneration.
Building on our published and preliminary results from mice and humans, our overarching hypothesis
is that SC migrating into the gut from the gut’s extrinsic innervation are an important source for postnatal
enteric neuro-gliogenesis, and that this ENS regenerative response is regulated by the microbiome via
5HT4. To test this novel hypothesis, we propose: Aim 1 will characterize postnatal SC-derived enteric neuro-
gliogenesis after microbiome eradication/re-establishment using inducible, fluorescently labeled mice. We will
also determine the functional effects of SC neuro-gliogenesis through extensive in vivo assays of motility and
permeability and ex vivo characterization of cellular function using calcium imaging. Additionally, we will
determine the functional effect of eliminating the SC entering the gut using a diphtheria toxin mouse model. In
Aim 2, we will use two knockout mouse lines: (1) P0CreER/tdT::Tph1-/- and (2) P0CreER/tdT::Tph2-/- to
determine the source of serotonin and the possible clinical applications of our findings by evaluating the SC
response to a 5HT4 agonist, prucalopride. We will also identify specific metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles
of the GI tract (mucosal and myenteric compartments). Finally in Aim 3, We will determine components of human
microbiome-host crosstalk regulating SC-derived enteric neuro-gliogenesis in patients with slow colonic
transit/dysmotility including the effect of 5HT4 agonists (i.e., prucalopride, tegaserod) on the ENS integrity/neuro-
glial regeneration and function and determine metagenomic profiles in our patient cohort. Last, we will perform
fecal transplants from these subjects into germ-free (GF) mice to evaluate ENS recovery. Results from this
proposal will be key for the continued progress in targeted regenerative therapy for the treatment of
congenital and acquired neuro-intestinal disease."

The proposed research investigates how genomic polymorphism of the TNFRSF13B
locus predicts and potentially governs the immune response to and outcomes of
transplantation. The investigators (de Mattos Barbosa et al., 2021) recently found that
non-synonymous mutations of TNFRSF13B occur 5-fold more frequently in kidney
transplant recipients that develop antibody-mediated rejection than in recipients with
persistently healthy grafts. The working hypothesis of this application is that TNFRSF13B
polymorphism shapes B cell responses to allotransplantation in ways that determine
pathogenicity of the responses. Since affinity-maturation, kinetics, self-non-self
discrimination and persistence of elicited antibody production have been connected with
TNFRSF13B function, these characteristics will be evaluated in allo-specific B cells
isolated from kidney transplant recipients. Because TNFRSF13B is among the most
polymorphic genes in humans and other mammals, the proposed research will draw on
diverse pools of kidney transplants already enrolled in the Michigan Genomics Initiative,
and in the NIH APOLLO study to connect genotypes with transplantation outcomes. The
results obtained with these cohorts will be verified by analysis of genotypes and outcomes
of subjects in two major NIH studies, DeKAF and GEN03. The large number of kidney
transplant recipients enrolled in the aforementioned studies will provide a vast pool from
which the phenotype and implications for transplantation of the most common allelic
TNFRSF13B variants can be identified. The functional properties of the most important
TNFRSF13B alleles in turn will be confirmed and the mechanism ascertained by
engineering tnfrsf13B mutations in mice and testing B cell functions and outcomes of
heterotopic cardiac allotransplants."

 Myelination of axons in the nervous system is critical for not only conduction of action
potentials, but also for providing tropic support to ensure long term survival of neurons in both
the central and peripheral nervous systems. Myelin disorders are a major cause of
neurological disease, and can be caused by genetic disorders, infectious disease, and
inflammation. The peripheral nervous system has substantial plasticity in being able to
regenerate after nerve injury, and critical transcription factors and their target gene networks
have begun to be elucidated. Schwann cell reprogramming to a new differentiated state is a
critical and rate limiting factor in peripheral nerve regeneration, particularly when regeneration
is impaired as a function of aging/chronic denervation. Therefore, understanding the pathways
that control gene expression reprogramming will provide insight into means by which
remyelination after nerve injury can be accelerated.
 The long term objective of our laboratory is to elucidate an integrated mechanism of
Schwann cell reprogramming after nerve injury based on critical transcriptional and
epigenomic switches. We have found that many critical injury genes are associated with
polycomb-associated histone modifications (H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub) prior to injury, and
this proposal focuses on testing how reversal of the polycomb pathway is required for
Schwann cell responses to peripheral nerve injury. We have also found an expected role of
polycomb eraser proteins in myelin homeostasis. Using a variety of techniques established in
our laboratory, we will test for the first time the involvement of modulating PRC1 pathway in
nerve injury responses. In addition, our work has highlighted mechanisms by which Sonic
Hedgehog is activated in repair Schwann cells, and we will employ novel mouse resources to
elucidate the mechanisms and role of Sonic Hedgehog signaling in injured peripheral nerve."
10930113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Chronic substance use is associated reduced mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopamine function. Despite having
a central role in research and applied models of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), very little is known about
the etiopathogenesis of altered dopamine function, especially in youth that engage in high-risk substance use.
For instance, it is fundamentally unclear in humans whether altered dopamine function precedes or follows
from substance use, differs by sex, or triggers neurodevelopmental changes (e.g., altered maturation in reward
circuit). The primary obstacles are that 1.) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging cannot be utilized in
pediatric populations to study early changes in dopamine function, and 2.) there is no developmentally-
appropriate alternative imaging method. Neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (NM-MRI)
provides a quantitative index of cumulative NM accumulation, which corresponds to lifetime biosynthesis rate
in dopamine-producing midbrain neurons. Unlike PET imaging, NM-MRI does not involve radiation exposure
and is therefore suitable for longitudinal investigations in youth to track pathophysiology of dopamine function
during the earliest stages of SUDs. In our studies, we have found that midbrain NM-MRI signal in 20-24 year-
olds is positively correlated with lifetime exposure to alcohol and marijuana, as well as with self-report markers
of reward function (n=149). This corroborates etiological theories of increased dopamine function early in
course of SUDs, yet the origin of increased NM accumulation is unclear given the age of the cohort. This R01
application is the next step of this novel program of research. We now propose to collect NM-MRI in a new
cohort of 300 15-16 year-olds, an age group on the cusp of transitioning from substance naïve to habitual
users. Then, we will collect two additional NM-MRI sessions over a year apart, a period in youth when they
vary naturally in frequency and intensity of substance use. This longitudinal project will test developmentally-
informative bi-directional hypotheses about the association between NM accumulation (a proxy for DA
biosynthesis) and adolescent substance use over a period of 36 months. Further, it will clarify whether pediatric
NM accumulation indexes pediatric reward function, tracks changes in pediatric reward function following
substance use, corresponds to activity in functional brain connectivity networks, and is moderated by sex
differences. These fundamental translational and neurodevelopmental questions about DA function cannot be
answered by PET imaging in a pediatric cohort. NM-MRI is poised to revolutionize translational science of
SUDs by enabling a suite of developmentally informative investigations."

Mammalian reproduction requires biparental genetic contributions due to the highly dimorphic nature of gamete
epigenomes. DNA methylation (DNAme) is one of the most sexually dimorphic epigenetic marks in gametes,
being hypermethylated in the sperm and alternatingly hypo- and hypermethylated in the oocyte. Aberrant
DNAme in the germline can negatively impact fertility and offspring development. To prevent transmission of
epimutations and establish the germline fate, primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo global DNAme erasure
following specification. While most of the genome achieves demethylation through replication-coupled passive
dilution, the active demethylation pathway using the TET1 enzyme is required for methylation erasure of a
subset of loci. I recently discovered that sperm-specific hypomethylated regions, while rare, require TET1 for
reprogramming. Tissue-specific hypomethylation signatures often correlate with binding of developmentally
relevant transcriptional factors, lending to the significance of these sperm-specific hypomethylated regions.
Mechanisms of how sperm or oocytes acquire sex-specific DNAme remain a knowledge gap with relevance to
fertility and development. While biochemically histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been
shown to correlate with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) accessibility, it remains unknown how these
epigenetic marks become non-uniformly enriched within the germline genome. I hypothesize that histone
PTMs enrichment and DNAme patterning in the germline are determined 1) intrinsically by the demethylation
pathway used during PGC reprogramming and 2) extrinsically by the signaling milleu of the gonadal supporting
cells. To test this hypothesis in vivo, genetic mouse models and multi-omics analyses will be used to elucidate
what cellular signals are responsible for the acquisition of sex-specific DNAme signatures in the sperm and the
oocyte. Aim 1 (K99) will test the catalytic and non-catalytic requirement for TET1 during PGC development for
the establishment of the methylation signature of the oocyte genome. Aim 2 (R00) will employ genetic sex-
reversal models of Dmrt1 overexpression in pre-granulosa cells (female-to-male) and constitutively active Wnt
signaling in pre-Sertoli cells (male-to-female) to test the impact of altering the somatic signaling environment
for DNAme acquisition in germ cells. In these models, I will integrate and identify correlations between changes
in methylome and the relevant histone PTMs enrichment (methylation of H3K4 and H3K36). Single cell
transcriptomics will be used to identify instructive cues for the establishment of sex-specific DNAme signatures
in gametes. I will receive extensive training in advanced bioinformatics and single-cell genomics during the
mentored phase of this proposal under the mentorship of Dr. Bartolomei, a pioneer in DNAme and genomic
imprinting, within the UPenn Epigenetics Institute. With the additional guidance from my advisory committee,
which includes leaders in the field of germ cell epigenetics and gonadal signaling pathways, I will be well
prepared to become an independent investigator in the field reproductive epigenetics."

By 2050, racial disparities will persist among the projected 11 million adults with Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Prior research links racial segregation to AD/ADRD, highlighting the
need for structural solutions to mitigate the racially patterned cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden that
accelerates AD/ADRD onset. Economic disinvestment prevents Black, poor, and Stroke Belt
neighborhoods from investing in their local infrastructure, while systemic barriers lead to political
disenfranchisement among the very historically excluded groups who would benefit most from effective
health policy. However, it is not known how disinvestment and disenfranchisement—factors produced by
structural racism—contribute to AD/ADRD disparities via excess CVD risk.
This proposed K99/R00 harnesses the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) Study, Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and administrative claims from Medicare
Beneficiaries. For my K99 phase, I will identify indicators of economic disinvestment and political
disenfranchisement that worsen AD/ADRD trajectories and widen racial disparities in REGARDS and
HRS. Then I will use these results to calculate the population attributable fraction of disinvestment and
disenfranchisement on AD/ADRD among Medicare Beneficiaries. During my R00 phase, I will analyze the
mediating role of CVD in associations of disinvestment or disenfranchisement and incident AD/ADRD in
Medicare claims. Finally, I will utilize the CVD Policy Model to forecast nationwide community
empowerment policies to reduce CVD risk factors for AD/ADRD up to three decades in the future.
Building upon my foundation of data science, causal inference, and CVD epidemiology, my training plan
consists of new knowledge domains: 1) AD/ADRD science, 2) spatial modeling, 3) Medicare claims, and
4) estimation of public health impact attainable with structural interventions.
Based at the richly resourced University of California, San Francisco, I have assembled a team of
distinguished mentors with the ideal combination of expertise to facilitate my success. The integrated
science, training, mentorship, and professional development will prepare me for a faculty position at an
R1 institution. My longterm goal is to become an independent investigator who develops interventions and
policies to prevent AD/ADRD among low-income, Black, and Stroke Belt communities."

(ORIF): A multicenter randomized controlled trial
Project Summary/Abstract
The current standard treatment for tibial plateau fracture fixation, open reduction internal fixation
(ORIF), has significant limitations including surgical site infections, pain, stiffness, and a
prolonged period of non-weight bearing restrictions. The large soft tissue dissection for ORIF is
associated with an increased risk of surgical site infections, and limited visualization of joint
reduction in this surgical approach is associated with an increased risk of future total knee
arthroplasty secondary to post-traumatic osteoarthritis.1-6 Arthroscopic-assisted tibial plateau

accelerated post-operative recovery, and preserves joint longevity.7,8 Several studies have
reported good outcomes with low complication rates of AATPF for lateral tibial plateau
fractures.9,10 However, there is no Level I evidence comparing outcomes of AATPF and outcomes
of the traditional ORIF approach. We have designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT)

 Physical activity (PA) has been listed as a promising intervention to delay or prevent Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD), however most studies used self-reported PA. Our preliminary
data show that, among older women, higher amounts of accelerometer-measured moderate to vigorous
intensity PA and steps/day are associated with lower risk of rigorously adjudicated incident mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and ADRD. However, the molecular mechanisms through which PA influences ADRD risk
are unclear. The plasma proteome is a promising target for identifying the molecular mechanisms of PA
because proteins regulate biological processes, capture disease mechanisms, and may identify intervention
targets. Machine learning (ML) methods have been applied to derive PA proteomic signatures, proteomic aging
clocks, and ADRD proteomic clocks. However, few studies have systematically applied and compared ML
methods to derive PA proteomic signatures. The objective of this research is to enhance our understanding of
PA, proteomics, and how they relate to ADRD. I propose leveraging an NIA-funded study (RF1AG079149) that
will use the SOMAscan platform to measure ~7,000 clinically relevant plasma proteins and plasma AD
biomarkers in a case cohort of 2,836 (n=1,336 incident MCI/ADRD cases) women in the richly phenotyped and
racially/ethnically diverse Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Memory Study (WHIMS) from samples collected in
1995-1998 (n=2,836) and 14-18 years later in 2012-2013 (n=1,000; 500 incident MCI/ADRD cases) and the
WHI Objective Physical Activity and Cardiovascular Health (OPACH; R01HL105065) study which collected
accelerometry in 2012-2014 among 6,489 women, including the 1,000 WHIMS women in RF1AG079149.
WHIMS contains longitudinal annual cognitive assessments and rigorously adjudicated MCI/dementia over 27
years of follow-up. In the R00 phase, I propose obtaining plasma biomarkers of AD pathology from 600 Black
and Hispanic/Latina OPACH women. Study results will be replicated in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities study to extend findings to men and women. Our Aims are: (1a) Apply and compare ML methods
to derive PA proteomic signatures, (1b) Examine the overlap of PA proteomic signatures, proteomic aging
clocks, and ADRD proteomic clocks, (1c) Relate PA proteomic signatures with MCI/ADRD and cognitive
functioning, (2) Determine the role of PA-associated plasma proteins in our observed PA-MCI/ADRD
associations, and (3) Determine the associations of PA (self-reported and accelerometer-measured) and PA-
associated plasma proteins with plasma AD biomarkers among Black, Hispanic/Latina, and White women. This
research will advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking PA, aging, and ADRD. The addition
of plasma AD biomarker data to OPACH will have an enduring impact by enabling broader studies of
accelerometry and AD pathology in relation to aging-related phenotypes."

To enable the expression of ideas in everyday conversation, our brain must hold on to speech information for
short periods of time in verbal working memory (vWM). This is particularly important for everyday conversation
that takes place in chaotic environments: Plans for speaking change quickly, and the brain has to adapt to these
changes. Previous models of vWM, have suggested that vWM is anatomically and functionally discrete, with only
indirect interactions with speech production. Evidence from lesions following strokes however, have shown a
wide range of speech production deficits that are also associated with problems with vWM, arguing against a
strong dissociation between speech production and vWM. We propose instead that vWM is integrated in the
speech production planning system, sharing an anatomical and functional substrate. To study this overlap, we
propose to examine neural responses associated with this functional overlap through a population of
neurosurgical patients who as part of their clinical care have electrodes implanted directly in their brain, giving
us a unique opportunity to study the human brain at a greater resolution that has been done in the past. We will
leverage this access to address the following questions: 1) Does speech production and vWM overlap in the
brain? 2) What kind of information is held when planning for speech production? 3) What motor features are
shared between speech production and vWM? We will use a series of tasks that are designed to separate out
the role of vWM for different speech production components and measure human brain responses using direct
brain recordings, including high density electrodes that have unprecedented spatial resolution (<1 mm, up to
1024 electrodes for a 10 x increase in sampling). Understanding this basic cognitive process and their role in
everyday language use will lead to more targeted approaches to help the over 1 million Americans who suffer
from stroke-induced aphasia."

We recently discovered an unexpected and intriguing role for white adipose tissue (WAT) in breast cancer. Our
past studies identified that the mechanical properties of WAT extracellular matrix (ECM) regulate tumor cell
invasion, a key rate-limiting step of metastasis, and that these properties are altered in obesity, contributing to
the increased prevalence and worse prognosis of breast cancer in obese patients. Now, recent preliminary data
from our labs additionally suggest that adipocyte mechanical properties may be similarly important. However,
how adipocyte mechanics change with obesity and which effect these changes have on ECM remodeling and
tumor invasion remains largely unclear. Understanding these connections is important for several reasons: First,
while the biochemical functions of WAT are widely known to contribute to the pathogenesis of breast cancer, the
influence of WAT mechanical properties on breast cancer invasion is largely unexplored. Second, our preliminary
data suggest that aberrant remodeling of WAT in obese individuals promotes breast cancer invasion due to
adipocyte lipid loss, transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, and consequential changes in ECM deposition all of
which affect WAT mechanics. Last, our preliminary results also indicate that tumor-induced lipid loss may
synergistically promote invasion by changing WAT mechanical properties and tumor cell metabolism. Elucidating
how these parameters are interconnected will be critical to decrease breast cancer burden and requires
computational methods to uncover how single-cell properties of adipocytes and tumor cells affect WAT
mechanics and tumor cell invasion. Through three focused and complementary Specific Aims, the proposed
work iteratively couples computational models of tumor cell invasion into WAT, materials characterization of
adipocytes and ECM, engineered cell culture models, and transgenic mouse models that allow visualization and
manipulation of WAT in the mammary gland. Furthermore, single cell and spatial RNA transcriptomics, coupled
with advanced bioinformatics approaches and human specimens, will determine the associated molecular
mechanisms and potential value to patient prognosis. In particular, we will (1) define WAT physical properties in
the breast as a function of obesity and determine their effect on tumor invasion, (2) determine the synergistic
effect of tumor-induced lipid loss on WAT physical properties and tumor cell metabolism, and (3) establish the
molecular basis of tumor-induced lipid loss in lean versus obese adipocytes and determine their effect on WAT
physical properties and tumor invasion. These studies will identify specific obesity-dependent changes in WAT
mechanical properties and their associated molecular mechanisms that will help predict the risk of breast cancer
invasion for a given patient based on histological analysis."

Monitoring the transition to wakefulness is critical during restoration to consciousness after brain injury,
anesthesia, and in those COVID-19 survivors that have altered consciousness. However, we have an imprecise
understanding of neural dynamics linked to behavioral changes as subjects awaken. Our previous work
discovered that stimulating the anterior nucleus gigantocellularis (aNGC) promotes arousal from a coma-like
state. We proposed recruiting multiple arousal pathways through aNGC as an avenue to triggering widespread
activation resulting in wakefulness. Notably, aNGC activation increased frontal-motor cortical activity and
restored full mobility through modulation of an aNGC-to-frontal-motor-cortex pathway despite high anesthetic
concentration exposure. We also showed that animals emerging from diverse coma-like states share a common
dynamic process of cortical and motor arousal that can be consistently sequenced from deep to high arousal
levels. We identified five cortical periods that tracked restored motor behavior in a hypoglycemic coma and a
range of anesthetics, whether inhaled or injected, alongside conventional righting reflex assays. Based on these
findings, we postulate that restoring waking is a common progressive process in which cortical patterns contain
metrics of consciousness that distinguish reflexive from purposeful movements. We hypothesize that cortical
measurements that link neural responsiveness to defined behaviors are an applicable method that can
extend the analysis of the recovery of consciousness beyond monitoring reflexive movements.
Our proposal deepens our understanding of the contribution of cortical neural subtypes, the neuronal pathways
underlying aNGC-induced changes in frontal-motor cortical activity, and the temporal dynamics that distinguish
reflexive from the initiation of voluntary behaviors in our rodent-low arousal models. In addition, we will establish
the cortical patterns that unpack these behavioral transitions. Since pathological states of unconsciousness are
vastly heterogeneous, having a clear understanding of ordinary recovery serves to better appreciate the
variability imposed by the injury to cortical activity and behavior. Thus, we will identify how damaged neural
circuits affect established cortical activity pathways and dynamics that underlie behavior recovery. The proposed
studies are thus significant because they will establish the mechanistic correspondence, examining activation of
neural pathways and their dynamics linked to habitual and intentional behaviors that reveal novel, medically
relevant biomarkers that promote a robust inference of arousal states during emergence from anesthesia and
after brain injury."

The increasing rise in antibiotic resistance and the diminished discovery of new antimicrobials threatens global
healthcare. Of particular concern are Gram-negative pathogens, as these organisms are intrinsically resistant
to multiple classes of antibiotics and the discovery of novel drugs targeting these bacteria has remained
challenging. The innate resistance of these organisms is provided primarily by their outer membrane (OM), a
defining feature of Gram negatives that encapsulates their peptidoglycan layer. Unlike the inner membrane
(IM) that is composed solely of glycerophospholipids (GPLs), the OM is asymmetrical with GPLs found in the
inner leaflet and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) localized to the outer leaflet. This unique membrane organization
affords protection from large polar molecules, as well as lipophilic compounds, creating an impervious barrier.
Since the OM is essential, pathways required for its assembly are key targets for antimicrobial design.
Currently, there are no antibiotics that directly target OM biogenesis in clinical use and first attempts have
proven difficult. Thus, it remains critical to investigate cell envelope biology for future and current antimicrobial
design.
Recently, we discovered a connection between the GPL cardiolipin (CL) and the synthesis and transport of
LPS. E. coli harbors three distinct enzymes that synthesize CL, yet CL is not required for cell viability and is the
least abundant of the three major GPLs in Gram negatives. We found LpxM, the enzyme that adds the last acyl
chain to the lipid anchor of LPS, to be critical for viability in the absence of clsA. Suppressors of clsA and lpxM
synthetic lethality were identified in msbA, a gene that encodes the essential, homodimeric ABC transporter
that “flips” LPS across the IM. Multiple pieces of genetic and biochemical data supported a model in which CL
enhances MsbA activity driving LPS transport. Also, we observed that single mutants lacking either ClsA, the
primary CL synthase, or LpxM have reduced LPS levels. This suggests the cell can “sense” defects in LPS
transport at the cytoplasmic face of the IM and slow LPS synthesis to balance OM lipid content. In the current
application we will define (i) the functional role of CL in MsbA-dependent LPS transport, (ii) characterize
specific MsbA-CL interactions and determine how they impact MsbA activity, (iii) determine if ClsA and MsbA
are co-localized in the bacterial cell envelope, and (iv) determine how defects in LPS transport results in
feedback inhibition of LPS synthesis. Completion of these Aims will provide novel insights into cell envelope
biogenesis and promote the development of novel therapeutics targeting Gram-negative pathogens."

Soft tissue sarcomas (STSs) are diverse mesenchymal tumors that occur within connective tissues such as
muscle, fat, and cartilage. STS is a highly heterogeneous malignancy with over 70 genetic and histological
subtypes. In addition, high rates of recurrence and lack of effective treatment for patients emphasize the need
to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities common to multiple STS subtypes. Metabolically, STS tumors
consistently exhibit high rates of glucose uptake and robust hypoxia gene signatures in patients. Therefore, we
focused on fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, to combat the typical
glycolytic dependence of STS. In previous studies, we showed that FBP2, the muscle-specific isoform of FBP,
is severely downregulated in several prevalent STS subtypes. Surprisingly, FBP2 re-expression in STS in vivo
opposes sarcoma progression through two spatially distinct mechanisms in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. FBP2
restoration decreases cytosolic glycolytic flux while nuclear FBP2 directly binds to c-Myc, a transcriptional
regulator of growth and metabolism. This interaction attenuates c-Myc-dependent expression of TFAM, a key
regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. These mechanisms, at least
in part, contribute to the ability of re-expressed FBP2 to suppress tumor growth in murine STS models. However,
my preliminary data suggest that nuclear FBP2 may also directly regulate other c-Myc cell cycle target genes
CDK4 and AURKA to contribute to STS suppression. Moreover, how FBP2 regulates c-Myc and the sites of
FBP2/c-Myc binding are not known. Recent studies suggest that FBP2 oligomerization and conformation may
also play an important role in FBP2's nuclear-to-cytosolic shuttling, and reveal new binding sites for other proteins
in the nucleus like c-Myc. Therefore, I hypothesize that the exposed N-terminal regions of tetrameric FBP2
complexes bind directly to c-Myc, contributing to STS suppression by inhibiting both TFAM and cell
cycle regulators. In Aim 1, I will map the sites of interaction between FBP2 and c-Myc and determine whether
the tetrameric state of FBP2 is necessary for binding. In Aim 2, I will explore the functional outcomes of the
FBP2/c-Myc interaction in sarcoma, including the regulation of cell cycle genes AURKA and CDK4. Together,
this proposal will provide more insight into the recently discovered nuclear functions of FBP2 to create novel
therapies for a diverse set of genetically heterogeneous sarcomas."

KRAS and EGFR mutations are the most prevalent genetic alterations detected in human lung adenocarcinomas, and play essential roles in malignant transformation and disease progression. The small GTPase Rac1, a member of the Rho family, is a key signaling effector of KRAS and EGFR oncogenic pathways. Rac1 has been widely implicated in the formation of actin-rich protrusive structures required for cancer cell motility and invasion, as well as in the activation of oncogenic and metastatic gene expression networks. Activation of Rac1 (i.e. GTP loading) is mediated by Rac-GEFs, a large family of Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors largely associated with tumorigenesis and invasiveness. Strikingly, there is limited information on the contribution of Rac-GEFs to lung cancer progression. Moreover, their relationship to specific lung cancer oncogenic mutations remains unknown. We carried out a systematic and unbiased screening for Rac-GEFs responsible for driving pro-motile phenotypes in KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines. This analysis unambiguously identified three Rac-GEFs (ARHGEF39, FARP1 and TIAM2) as mediators of ruffle formation and motility in NSCLC cells. To our surprise, well-studied GEFs, such as TIAM1, TRIO, VAV isoforms and P-REX isoforms, were either poorly expressed or dispensable in our model. We therefore hypothesize that these Rac-GEFs are major players in lung cancer progression. In Aim 1, we will generate KRAS mutant cell lines deficient in RacGEFs using a CRISPR/Cas9 approach, and determine their contribution to invasion, ECM protease production and metastasis in mouse models. In addition, the requirement of selected Rac-GEFs to the development of autochthonously-arising metastatic lung cancer will be determined using a lentiviral CRISPR-based gene editing approach in Kras G12D/WT; p53 flox/flox mice (KP mice). In Aim 2 the goal is to identify and characterize Rac-GEFs as EGFR effectors in NSCLC. To unequivocally elucidate their permissive roles in mutant EGFR lung cancer progression phenotypes, in vivo lentiviral CRISPR-based Rac-GEF gene editing in an EGFR L858R-driven, p53 deficient lung adenocarcinoma mouse model will be performed. Mechanistically, we aim to disentangle the basis of Rac-GEF activation by pursuing a comprehensive signaling analysis of proximal EGFR adaptors and effectors. In Aim 3, we will first elucidate Rac-GEF-dependent gene transcriptomes and network signatures driven by mutant KRAS and mutant EGFR. Finally, we will determine Rac-GEF expression in single tumor cells isolated from malignant pleural effusions (a site of lung metastatic dissemination), as well as in single and clustered circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood of mutant KRAS and mutant EGFR lung adenocarcinoma patients. The identification of novel Rac-GEFs provides unprecedented information to predict metastatic disease outcome in lung cancer patients and increase the likelihood of identifying metastasis biomarkers, ultimately aiding in refining patient prognosis and decision-making in a clinical setting."

application in therapeutic development. The project will optimize non-human primate (NHP) and rodent analogs
of human auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) for use in preclinical development programs. Deficits in MMN
generation have been extensively described in schizophrenia (Sz) and shown to correlate with cognitive
impairment and poor functional outcome in established Sz, and in conversion to Sz among individuals at clinical
high risk (CHR), demonstrating clinical relevance. MMN may also decrease in amplitude during the initial stages
of Sz, providing a target for development of treatments that may prevent neurodegeneration during initial stages
of the disorder. MMN indexes the integrity of early auditory processing (EAP) such as delayed tone matching
abilities, which are critical for processes such as auditory emotion recognition, verbal memory, and phonological
reading ability. Deficits in these processes, in turn, significantly predict outcome. In addition, local circuit
abnormalities that give rise to MMN impairments in auditory cortex may be present across brain regions. Insights
gleaned from investigation and remediation of MMN deficits may therefore be relevant across cortical regions. In
humans, MMN generation is inhibited reliably by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), suggesting
involvement of underlying glutamatergic mechanisms and local excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. In spectral
analyses, MMN shows primary power within the theta frequency range, suggesting additional involvement of
somatostatin (SOM)-type GABA interneurons. MMN-like activity has been demonstrated in both NHP and
rodents, and in both species shows similar spectral content and NMDAR sensitivity to human MMN. The present
project will 1) further optimize these measures for use in early-stage drug development, while 2) also evaluating
their sensitivity and selectivity to compounds that do (e.g. NMDAR antagonists) and do not (e.g. 5-HT2A
antagonists) affect their generation in humans. These measures will then 3) be used to test specific local and
distributed circuit computational models to permit refinement in use of MMN paradigms across humans, NHP and
rodents. At the distributed network level, mechanistic testing will seek to refine emergent prediction error (PE)
based theories of MMN generation, which posit specific feed-forward and feed-back information flow among
primary auditory cortex (A1), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and to develop
spectral signatures of this information flow. At the local circuit level, mechanistic testing will assess the relative
contributions of specific interneuron populations using cell-specific genetic manipulation. Several compounds that
target NMDAR via the glycine/D-serine modulatory site (e.g. iclepertin, luvadaxisat) have shown promise for
treatment of Cognitive Impairment Associated with Sz (CIAS). The present pipeline will enable identification and
validation of additional targets within the E/I circuit and development of additional approaches for enhancement
of glutamatergic function and restoration of E/I balance across neuropsychiatric disorders."

Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is a form of cardiopulmonary bypass used in
critically ill children and adults to support the heart and lungs when conventional therapies fail.
More than 79,762 children worldwide have been supported to date, and global use of this tool is
expanding. Advances in ECMO and critical care have improved survival of otherwise fatal
illnesses, thereby unmasking neurologic injury which itself reduces survival by 50-60% and leads
to significant long-term neurologic morbidity. The mechanisms of ECMO-related cerebral injuries
are poorly understood. Existing research focuses on evaluating discrete elements, such as
underlying illness, coagulation abnormalities, anticoagulation management, or markers of end-
organ perfusion as factors associated with brain injury. Prior studies have not considered the
temporal and dynamic element of clinical events that may play a large role in the genesis of brain
injury, and few have explored which variables could predict significant neurologic injury without
the bias of pre-selecting variables of interest. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence
that employs algorithms to discover patterns in an iterative manner directly from input data: in the
context of ECMO, it can identify dynamic patterns and relationships between variables prior to
neurologic injury.
 The long-term goal of this research is to identify modifiable bedside predictors of neurologic
impairment and thereby drive the development of early interventions to improve neurologic
outcomes of children undergoing ECMO. Towards this goal, we have assembled a multi-
disciplinary team with clinical and computational expertise. Our central hypothesis is that a robust
risk predictive model for SNI in ECMO patients can be developed based on the physiological and
laboratory data routinely collected in real-world clinical settings and that this model can be used
to identify parameters of SNI for potential intervention. This proposal will utilize advanced machine
learning algorithms to build this prediction model in a large multicenter cohort (0-18 years, n=750).
In Aim 1, we will use novel probabilistic machine learning algorithms to train and develop a model
to predict SNI by neuroimaging. In Aim 2, we will validate and refine the model from Aim 1 using
neuroimaging scores and explore a personalized anytime query algorithm that predicts the timing
and type of SNI. This collaborative proposal between clinical and computational scientists will lay
the groundwork for a neuroprotective interventional study by identifying modifiable risk factors to
improve the tragically high neurologic morbidity and mortality in ECMO survivors."

The ultimate goal of this research program is to advance hemiarthroplasty performance. Hemiarthroplasty
involves replacement of one of the articular joint surfaces with an artificial bearing surface. It offers a clear benefit
in patients with localized cartilage damage, preserving the healthy bone and cartilage in the joint to maximize
future treatment options. And hemiarthroplasty is inherent in the replacement of individually diseased carpal
(wrist) or tarsal (foot) bones, which have multiple articulations with neighboring bones. Currently,
hemiarthroplasty outcomes vary dramatically by the joint involved and by the type of bearing surface used to
articulate with the opposing cartilage. Failure most often occurs by degeneration of the opposing articular
surface. A critical challenge in advancing hemiarthroplasty performance is the ability to identify bearing surfaces
that will maintain healthy cartilage. There are numerous candidate biomaterials that might be suitable for use as
hemiarthroplasty bearing surfaces, including metals, ceramics, and polymers, as well as specialized coatings,
such as titanium nitride and pyrolytic carbon. However, the performance of these materials has been mixed, due
in large part to the lack of standardized and validated testing methodologies. Accordingly, the specific objective
of this project is to develop a model where benchtop and ex vivo testing can predict the cartilage response to
hemiarthroplasty bearing system wear in a fit-for-purpose large animal model. This goal will be achieved by
completing three specific aims. In the first, we will characterize the material and mechanical properties of eight
candidate hemiarthroplasty bearing surfaces (2 metals, 4 polymers, 1 ceramic, and 1 pyrolytic carbon) using
standard benchtop mechanical tests (roughness, wettability, modulus, hardness, and wear testing against
cortical bone). In the second, we will characterize the cartilage bearing performance of each of the candidate
biomaterials by wear testing them against bovine cartilage plugs in a joint motion-simulating biotribometer, using
proteoglycan/glycosaminoglycan (PG/GAG) and hydroxyproline as measures of cartilage matrix degradation and
live/dead assays as a measure of cell damage. In the third, we will test four of the 8 materials from Aims 1 & 2
as bearing surfaces in a novel unicompartmental tibial hemiarthroplasty model in the Yucatan minipig, measuring
cartilage damage (macro- and microscopic), synovial inflammation, cartilage thickness, and osteophyte bone
formation at 52 weeks. And finally, we will develop a statistical model where the data from Aims 1 and 2 can be
used to predict the outcome in Aim 3. The work outlined in this proposal will yield a model where benchtop and
ex vivo testing can predict the cartilage response to hemiarthroplasty. This project will provide a crucial tool
needed to accelerate the design, development, and FDA clearance of new hemiarthroplasty bearing surfaces,
resulting in a significant benefit for millions of patients afflicted with degenerative joint disease."
10879099,"Project Summary / Abstract
 The Hippo-signaling pathway (HSP), a kinase cascade, inhibits nuclear localization and transcriptional
activity of YAP, a transcription co-factor. In previous work, deletion of the HSP component Sav in mouse and pig
cardiomyocytes (CMs) with established ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF), results in reversal of
HF and improved heart function due to increased nuclear YAP and activation of YAP target genes. These
groundbreaking findings indicate that uncovering methods to modulate YAP activity is valuable to treat ischemic
cardiomyopathy and HF, which is the goal of this research program. Importantly, YAP is primarily regulated by
post-translational modifications (PTMs), which control YAP nuclear/cytoplasmic subcellular localization
dynamics. HSP kinases inhibit YAP nuclear localization by phosphorylating conserved serine residues in YAP.
When HSP activity is low, YAP enters the nucleus and complexes with Tead family transcription factors to
activate genes involved in progression through multiple cell cycle phases. In addition to HSP-mediated
phosphorylation, the recent discovery that a Lysine acetylation-deacetylation cycle controls YAP nuclear-
cytoplasmic localization provides an opportunity to develop novel therapies for cardiomyopathy, which will be
investigated in this research program.
 Protein acetylation-deacetylation is very sensitive to the metabolic state of the local cellular environment.
During myocardial infarction (MI), metabolism quickly shifts from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to
glycolysis due to oxygen deficiency in CMs. Consequently, Lysine acetylation, one of the main PTMs closely
associated with metabolism, is also altered. The notion that HF-altered myocardial metabolism contributes to
disease pathogenesis and that regulating it may serve innovative therapeutic purposes underscores the
importance of identifying the metabolic characteristics of HF patients. It is therefore critical to clarify how YAP
responds to post-MI environmental factors or metabolic changes. The proposed studies are based on preliminary
data revealing that following MI, YAP acetylation is required for YAP/cytoskeleton interactions, wherein YAP
binds the non-muscle actin filaments. These data reveal an MI-induced metabolic shift pathway wherein
acetylation promotes YAP sequestration with the stabilized microtubule network in the cytoplasm, which is
detrimental to cardiac regeneration. The aims of these proposed studies are to investigate phosphorylated and
acetylated YAP in the contexts of HF and low HSP activity using advanced genomics, gene therapies, and
mouse HF models. These studies will reveal how metabolic shifts after MI regulate YAP activity via Lysine
acetylation in CMs and how YAP regulates the CM cytoskeleton. Using clinically approved compounds that
target metabolic substrates/intermediates, Lysine acetyltransferases, and Lysine deacetylases, these
studies will guide the development of new strategies to target YAP acetylation for HF treatment."

Inflammatory cytokines are potent stimulators of osteoclastic bone resorption. During aging, there are increased
levels of these inflammatory mediators that are widely associated with perturbed skeletal homeostasis, and more
recently fracture healing. During the past decade, the influence of inflammatory signals on bone health has been
the focus of many laboratories. One particular family of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17 family) has been
increasingly shown to play key roles in controlling skeletal homeostasis. We came across the discovery that
serum levels of IL-17a in fractured old mice were dramatically increased compared to young controls. Conditional
deletion of the main receptor for IL-17a (IL-17ra) in osteoclasts resulted in decreased bone resorption and
increased bone mass in vivo. Based on additional preliminary findings, our postulated mechanism underlying IL-
17ra control of bone remodeling involves the newly discovered transcriptional repressor of osteoclastic bone
resorption, Runx1. Based on the above, we postulate that deletion of IL-17ra in OCLs will increase bone mass
during skeletal homeostasis and promote bone repair through stage specific inhibition of osteoclastic bone
resorption by Runx1 during fracture callus remodeling.
In Aim 1, we propose to examine the function of OCL-produced IL-17ra and mechanisms via which it modulates
bone remodeling during homeostasis in the aging skeleton. Specifically, we will determine if loss of IL-17ra in
OCLs will increase bone mass in aging mice (1A). We will then demonstrate that deletion of IL-17ra in OCLs
inhibits bone resorption through upregulation of Runx1 (1B). Finally, we will determine if deletion of IL-17ra in
OCLs is sufficient to halt ovariectomy-induced bone loss (1C). In the second Aim, we propose to evaluate
whether inhibition of IL-17ra or activation of Runx1 in OCLs can stage-dependently control bone healing in aging
mice by first evaluating the effects of IL-17ra abrogation on callus remodeling and bone repair in aging mice
(2A). We will then examine whether stage-dependent overexpression of Runx1 in OCLs is sufficient to accelerate
the healing of senile fractures (2B). Finally, we will devise a therapeutic strategy to accelerate fracture healing
in aging mice via delivery of a small molecule to temporally activate Runx1 during callus remodeling (2C).
The data obtained from the proposed experiments will reveal new anti-inflammatory downstream signaling
pathways that can serve as viable substitutes for the currently available anti-resorptive biologics."
10909363,"Lifestyle interventions have had established efficacy for decades but they are costly and have poor scalability.
Remotely delivered lifestyle interventions have increased the potential for scale and systematic reviews have
found that they are effective, especially those that include human coaching. Some remote lifestyle
interventions are synchronous, such that they are delivered via videoconferencing or phone. Other remote
lifestyle interventions are asynchronous, such that they are delivered via online platforms that allow for
clinicians and patients to engage via text exchanges or via online groups where patients engage with a
clinician and each other by posting messages and contributing to discussion threads. The advantage of
asynchronous approaches is 24/7 accessibility which makes them conducive to “just in time” support, allowing
patients to engage anytime they want to, as opposed to in scheduled blocks of time each week. Asynchronous,
remote interventions may also be more scalable than synchronous remote interventions. We conducted a trial
of two asynchronous, remote lifestyle interventions—one with a group of 94 participants and one with a group
of 40 participants. Findings revealed similar weight loss and acceptability between conditions. We also found
that the larger group was more sustainable, such that participants continued to engage in the group for longer
when we turned the groups over to participants to lead themselves for a year after the intervention ended—a
period we referred to as the peer-led maintenance phase. The next step in this research is to examine how an
asynchronous, remote intervention compares to a synchronous, remote intervention, not only in short term
weight loss, but also in sustainability, scalability, and weight loss maintenance. Now that we’ve established the
feasibility of conducing large asynchronous, remote groups, in the proposed trial we will randomize participants
to large groups (n=82) in both conditions, which will allow us to compare synchronous to asynchronous remote
interventions that are scaled up to a level that we have established is acceptable for asynchronous remote
interventions. The purpose of the proposed trial is to determine whether an asynchronous, remote lifestyle
intervention is non-inferior to a synchronous, remote lifestyle intervention in weight loss at 6 and 12 months,
but more scalable and sustainable, and thus producing greater weight loss maintenance at 18 and 24 months.
Establishing evidence for asynchronous interventions is more important than ever given that telehealth
reimbursement for behavioral health has recently expanded but is still limited to synchronous forms of remote
care. Asynchronous interventions may be more convenient for some people and possibly more scalable but for
this treatment model to reach its potential, evidence for efficacy is needed to inform reimbursement policy. We
hypothesize that an asynchronous, remote lifestyle intervention will produce similar initial weight loss as a
synchronous, remote version but will be less expensive, more sustainable, and generate greater collective
efficacy, which will drive greater weight loss maintenance at 18 and 24 months."

In this project, the investigators propose to study the allosteric mechanisms that regulate lysine degradation
and gain novel pathophysiological insights into the rare orphan disease glutaric aciduria type 1 (GA1). GA1 is
an autosomal recessive inborn error of lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan degradation. Patients can present
with brain atrophy and macrocephaly and may develop dystonia after acute encephalopathic crises that lead to
striatal degeneration. The disorder is caused by a deficiency of glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH), which
leads to the accumulation of neurotoxic glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid. GA1 is considered a treatable
disorder and therefore included in newborn screening programs in many countries. However, current treatment
consists of dietary intervention, carnitine supplementation, and emergency treatment which requires intense
efforts from both caregiver, patient and clinical team. It must be meticulously maintained, but in 25% of patients
neurological disease still develops with the outcome reflecting historical health inequities and social
determinants of disease. Thus, GA1 treatment needs further improvement, but development of new therapies
is hampered by limited understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms. In human patients and the GA1
mouse model, symptomatic disease is accompanied by a striking increase in neurotoxic glutaric- and 3-
hydroxyglutaric acid accumulation. The investigators hypothesize that the accumulation of toxic metabolites in
GA1 due to the deficiency of GCDH is controlled by allosteric regulation of the lysine degradation pathway. In a
high throughput screen, they have identified small molecule inhibitors and activators of the lysine-2-
oxoglutarate reductase domain (LOR) of 2-aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS). This led to the
discovery of a remarkable potential for allosteric regulation of this key enzyme in lysine degradation. Structural
studies revealed two novel allosteric sites in LOR, one able to bind inhibitors, the other binding activators.
Therefore the overall objective of this proposal is to understand the allosteric regulation of lysine degradation.
In AIM 1, the structural and biochemical mechanisms of allosteric regulation of LOR/AASS will be studied
using X-ray crystallography of LOR/AASS in complex with allosteric activators/inhibitors and enzymology. In
AIM 2, the biological significance of allosteric regulation of LOR/AASS and its role in determining lysine
degradation flux will be studied. The investigators will identify endogenous inhibitors and activators of
LOR/AASS, and define the native protein interaction network of AASS. This knowledge will be used to define
how this allosteric mechanism controls lysine degradation and contributes to metabolite accumulation in a GA1
cell line model. In AIM 3, neutral activators of LOR/AASS will be developed using a combination of medicinal
chemistry and structure-based drug design. The ultimate goal of this project is to better understand the
pathophysiology of GA1 and provide new treatment options."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for >800,000 deaths annually, i.e., 32% of all deaths in the US, with
total costs projected to reach $2.5 trillion by 2035. Experimental and epidemiologic data identify sleep disorders-
-recently recognized in American Heart Association Life’s Essential 8--as independent preventative targets to
mitigate downstream major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the sleep
disorder most consistently implicated in CV risk operating via pathways of intermittent hypoxia and sympathetic
nervous system activation. Emerging science, however, from our group and others, has identified that other
facets of sleep disruption, such as curtailed sleep and sleep architectural disruption, also increase CV risk.
Enhanced phenotyping of not only OSA--beyond the limitations of the standardly used apnea-hypopnea index
(AHI) --- but also other sleep disorders could refine the ability to characterize sleep-related pathophysiology and
MACE prediction. However, overlapping sleep phenotypes contributing to CV risk are difficult to characterize,
given the need for large datasets. Moreover, the “sleepy” phenotype of sleep disorders is associated with
increased CV risk; however, there is limited understanding of how to integrate this into CV risk prediction.
Therefore, we propose leveraging an existing clinical registry of multimodal cardiorespiratory and neurologic
physiologic sleep data, i.e.,>186,000 archived sleep studies. The scope of work involves conducting an analysis
of biologically plausible aggregate biomarkers of CVD from datasets of polysomnograms (PSG) that combine
with artificial intelligence models to identify patterns from structured data and raw PSG signal data to forecast
the incidence of MACE (nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal, or fatal stroke) and
examine the influence of the sleepy phenotype. We will further examine the utility of incorporating automatic
PSG analysis in the current clinical CV risk stratification schema. This work will set the stage for external
validation work in other clinical cohorts and the NHLBI National Sleep Research Resource, a pooled
geographically diverse compilation of >45,000 sleep studies. The proposed work provides an innovative
opportunity to assess the ability of sleep study, i.e., PSG biomarkers, to predict individuals at increased risk for
CVD using methods established by our group. Innovation also lies in the use of state-of-the-art deep learning
strategies, including Transformers models for low-dimensional representation of PSG direct physiological
signals. Our group is well-positioned to undertake the following study aims, given the expertise and experience
we have in sleep medicine, cardiovascular, and computer science research."
10851816,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems and is characterized by
chronic inflammation, vasculopathy, and fibrosis. The standardized mortality ratio for SSc has not changed
significantly in the past 40 years, and one in three patients dies within 10 years of diagnosis. The scientific
premise of our proposal is that pro-fibrotic macrophages (MØs) are key drivers of SSc. Our hypothesis is that
targeting activated MØs in SSc will provide a novel and effective approach to treat the disease, and that the
elimination of these MØs will result in decreased fibrosis. We have designed a novel therapeutic approach to
eliminate pro-fibrotic MØs using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, and localized anti-CD206 CAR T cell
treatment reduces dermal thickness and gene expression associated with disease progression in a bleomycin
(BLM) mouse model of skin fibrosis. Given the systemic nature of SSc and the mortality associated with internal
organ involvement, we propose to determine the efficacy of systemic administration of anti-CD206 CAR T cells
for the treatment of pulmonary and dermal fibrosis.
Specific Aim 1: Determine if elimination of profibrotic MØs by CAR T cell immunotherapy reduces skin and lung
fibrosis. Depletion of the myeloid subsets targeted by CD206-CAR T cell immunotherapy and their impact on
skin and lung fibrosis are unknown. We will use CITE-seq to identify MØ subsets in skin and lung pre and post-
CAR T cell treatment and will measure collagen deposition, markers of inflammation, and tissue thickness.
Specific Aim 2: Determine anti-CD206 CAR T cell persistence in vivo using a systemic model of fibrosis.
Successful treatment of SSc will depend on CAR T persistence and maintenance of effector function. To monitor
anti-CD206 CAR T cells in preclinical in vivo studies, we will develop and validate a quantitative PCR assay to
measure copy number of the anti-CD206 CAR gene."

 Cancer immunotherapy is a promising approach for cancers with no or limited specific targeted therapies.
Various forms of immunotherapy, including checkpoint blockade immunotherapies, are proving to be effective
by boosting T cell-mediated immune responses. These therapies lead to marked and sustained clinical
responses, but only in a limited number of patients and cancer types. Anti-tumor immune responses require
functional presentation of tumor antigens and a microenvironment that favors competent immune effectors. To
execute the cytotoxicity on cancer cells, the CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize tumor antigens
presented on the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) complex of the cancer cell and trigger the
cancer cell to undergo programmed cell death. To evade immune surveillance, cancer cells employ various
mechanisms to downregulate the expression of MHC-I molecules or other proteins directly or indirectly involved
in antigen processing and presentation. Downregulation appears to be more common than complete elimination
of MHC-I expression because the latter renders cancer cells susceptible to the action of natural killer (NK) cells.
Increased antigen presentation on tumor cells can be of therapeutic significance since it makes tumor cells more
susceptible to the CTLs.
 In the preliminary study, we identified a membrane protein, MAL2, as an important player that reduces the
antigen presentation on breast cancer cells and suppresses the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. To
facilitate the preclinical studies for MAL2 inhibition, we have generated monoclonal antibodies against the mouse
MAL2. We will test the antitumor effect of MAL2 inhibitor (MAL2 mAb) in mouse breast tumor models. We will
also determine the therapeutic activity of MAL2 inhibitor in enhancing the efficacy of immune checkpoint
blockade immunotherapy."

In MRI, cardiac stimulation (CS) is the direct stimulation of the heart by rapid switching of the gradient
coils, a phenomenon referred to as magneto-stimulation. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
imposes limits on the speed and amplitude of gradient switching in MRI, however there is an almost
complete lack of data on magneto-stimulation, which has resulted in a necessarily restrictive safety
limit. Instead, the IEC 60601-2-33 limit for CS in MRI, which is the limit that the FDA relies on, is
based on simplified electric field calculations in uniform cylinders that mimic the human torso, and
open-chest CS experiments performed in animals using electrodes. Because of the known limitations
of this methodology, the IEC built in large safety factors in their choice of the CS limit, thus resulting in
a conservative safety recommendation. For example, for the four Siemens Connectome scanners in
use, the CS safety limit is more restrictive than the peripheral nerve stimulation limit at long rise times,
which is unlikely since conducting cells in the myocardium are harder to stimulate than large
peripheral nerves and the heart is deep inside the body, and therefore more shielded from electric
fields than shallow nerves. As the IEC MRI cardiac stimulation safety limit becomes more and more
restrictive for improving gradient systems, it is essential to study the magneto-stimulation
phenomenon in a more detailed manner using direct animal measurements and state-of-the-art
simulation methods.
 To our knowledge, only two groups have published direct measurements of cardiac magneto-
stimulation performed, in dogs, in the early 1990s. We propose a multidisciplinary bioengineering
research project that aims to measure, for the first time, cardiac magneto-stimulation
thresholds in pigs, a widely used animal model for the human cardiovascular system. In
addition, we develop a detailed simulation pipeline of cardiac magneto-stimulation using
state-of-the-art modeling techniques in order to shed light on the mechanisms of action of CS
in MRI and estimate stimulation thresholds in humans for a variety of coils and gradient
waveforms. We will work closely with the MT40 sub-committee of the IEC throughout the duration of
the project in order to ensure that our work maximally informs the setting of the IEC limit in the next
update of the IEC 60601-2-33 standard."
10734584,"SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality and complicates 3-8% of all
pregnancies. This pregnancy complication is defined by de novo hypertension arising after 20 weeks of
gestation and near term with proteinuria or other signs of end-organ damage. PE has been linked to high
incidence of chronic diseases later in life, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal
disease. Thus, directed therapy is critically important to improve both maternal and neonatal outcomes.
However, to date, no effective therapy for this syndrome is clinically available. The most effective treatment is
delivery of the placenta. Our recent novel findings suggest that PE and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) share a
common etiology of proteinopathy and impaired autophagy and that accumulation of protein aggregates in the
PE placenta directly results from dysregulated lysosomal biogenesis. Our work also suggests that impaired
autophagy not only enhance protein aggregate accumulation but also induces sterile inflammation and reduces
endovascular ability of trophoblasts. This work has led to search for therapeutic interventions that uniquely
target impaired autophagy and toxic protein aggregation. Our preliminary results suggest that a non-
mammalian disaccharide, Trehalose and its lacto analog Lactotrehalose, restored autophagy and inhibited
protein aggregation in a humanized mouse model of PE as well as in hypoxia-exposed primary human
trophoblasts. In the mouse model, Trehalose could be effective in both prevention and treatment settings. We
propose to expand on these intriguing preliminary results and propose novel experiments to assess the
efficacy of Trehalose and Lactotrehalose for treatment of PE. Moreover, we plan to examine whether
Trehalose and Lactotrehalose can reverse transcriptome-wide changes and inflammation associated with PE
in in vivo and in vitro models. The Specific Aims proposed in this proposal adhere to the overarching goal of
establishing pre-clinical and cellular models to assess their significance in reversing PE-associated
pathological pathways. Based on mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of PE, our proposed research will
assess the ability of a small, inexpensive, and non-mammalian disaccharide to prevent and treat PE. This
straight forward intervention and reversal of PE pathology in well-defined pre-clinical and cellular models may
provide a basis for clinical evaluation of Trehalose and Lactotrehalose in pregnant women."
10933496,"In the United States (US), the percentage of men who do not want more children increases from 43% among
those between ages 25 to 34 years to 80% among men in their mid-30’s and early 40’s. Despite there being
few differences in US men’s fertility intentions, Black, Latino and low-income men are more likely to be
involved in unwanted pregnancies, which can contribute to the cycle of poverty among disadvantaged groups.
Vasectomy (i.e., male permanent contraception) is the most effective male contraceptive method for those who
do not want more children. Men of color and low-income men are far less likely to rely on vasectomy than
White men and those with higher incomes, and these differences in use have persisted for decades.
Vasectomy is also used less often than female sterilization in racial/ethnic minority and low-income
communities, but use is more comparable to female sterilization among Whites and those with higher incomes.
These uneven patterns of permanent contraception use may be related to racial/ethnic and income-based
differences in access to knowledge about vasectomy and its (lack of) effect on sexual functioning. Yet, even
with accurate and meaningful information, differences in vasectomy use may persist owing to unequal access
to care, particularly among medically underserved men. There have been few efforts to comprehensively
assess the individual demand- and healthcare supply-side factors that underlie differences in US men’s
reliance on vasectomy, which hampers progress toward reproductive health equity. The proposed study seeks
to address key individual-level determinants of disparities in vasectomy use - men’s knowledge and decisional
conflict about the method - to ensure all men, regardless of race/ethnicity and income, are able to make
informed, value-concordant decisions around contraception. Further, we will evaluate other facets of the
healthcare ecosystem that may shape men’s access affordable and timely services. The specific aims of the
study are to: 1) Build a patient-facing web-based decision aid to support high-quality vasectomy decisions; 2)
Assess the impact of the decision aid on the quality of vasectomy decision making and interest in a
randomized controlled trial with 750 men seeking information online about vasectomy or attending prenatal
care or family planning visits in the US; and 3) Identify modifiable barriers to obtaining a desired vasectomy
and strategies to address them by prospectively assessing men’s experiences accessing care at 2 and 6
months and conducting in-depth interviews. This innovative study offers a new approach to directly address
racial/ethnic and income-based differences in vasectomy knowledge and access by producing a scalable tool
designed to enhance men’s informed contraceptive decision making and care navigation. This study will also
enable us to identify other potential strategies that can facilitate timely, equitable access to desired vasectomy
services and advance gender equity in the work of preventing pregnancy at a time when options to terminate
undesired pregnancies have narrowed drastically."
10933449,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of drug resistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure and mortality. Although
much is known about the mechanisms by which tumor cells can become resistant to a given drug, translating
this into effective therapeutic solutions remains an unmet clinical need. Here we propose to pioneer the use
of patient derived tumor organoids (PDTOs) as a platform to identify and validate novel targets and effective
drugs to overcome drug resistance in ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other tumor types. In our
preliminary studies, we show that PDTOs genetically and phenotypically match the tumor from which they
were derived and can be used to study the phenotypic consequences of tumor heterogeneity, tumor
evolution, and drug resistance. Using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved
high complexity assay, we show that PDTO drug sensitivities are highly concordant with known genetic
biomarkers, retrospective treatment history and prospective patient responses. Tumor organoids derived
from patients who developed in situ drug resistance demonstrate ex vivo resistance to those same drugs but
also demonstrate sensitivity to other alternative oncology drugs. Additional preliminary studies show stable
disease or tumor regression in patients treated with drugs identified from organoid drug screens. Here, we
propose to combine drug screening and molecular profiling of PDTOs derived from a given patient from
different anatomic tumor sites and before and after therapy to elucidate the mechanistic basis for drug
sensitivity or resistance and to identify novel targets and effective drugs to treat metastatic, drug resistant
cancers. Accompanying computational prediction models that integrate large public datasets as well as
innovative methods of mechanistic target validation including CRISPR, targeted protein degradation
technologies, and epigenetic profiling, will be used to prioritize and advance targets and associated
biomarkers with greatest clinical potential. The rationale behind our approach is that identifying targets and
effective drugs directly in patient derived samples with known clinical history and outcomes will significantly
enhance translation of our findings. This proposal is significant because it will demonstrate the utility of
PDTOs as both a research tool for target discovery and validation but also as a clinically useful platform to
guide functional precision medicine. The findings and methods developed can be readily applied to other
cancer types and clinical challenges, will accelerate preclinical drug and drug target development, and will
translate to clinical studies. The models, approaches, and expected outcomes of this proposal are highly
responsive to the requirements of PAR-21-274."
10868529,"Abstract:

The social motivation/reward theory of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) outlines that individuals with autism tend not to pursue, engage or maintain social interactions because they find social interactions less rewarding than individuals without ASD. A major hypothesis is that traditional reward circuits play an important role in social motivation and reward and may be dysfunctional in autism; yet, mechanistic proof for this intriguing hypothesis has been sparse. We have recently discovered that a significant proportion of nucleus accumbens (NAc) D1R neurons, a key node in the reward circuit, are activated during social interaction and that a subset of these neurons maintains a neural population representation of social interaction across days. We have also found that both short- and long-term NAc population representations of social interaction become destabilized in the Cntnap2 -/- mutant animals with social behavioral dysfunction. In addition, we have developed a social reward task where animals are rewarded for specific actions with social contact. VTA dopaminergic projections to NAc are activated and dopamine is released during the performance of this social reward task, again highlighting the importance of NAc for social reward. Furthermore, using Neuropixels recordings in freely behaving animals, we show reciprocal coordination of the prefrontal cortex and NAc during social interaction, suggesting that multiregional synchronization may play a key role in modulating social reward. The Golshani and Hong labs have a strong history of productive collaboration. Together, we will test the overarching hypothesis that unstable long-term NAc D1R social representations, resulting from altered inputs to NAc, drive abnormal social behaviors in models with social behavioral dysfunction. In Aim 1, using calcium imaging with wire-free miniaturized microscopes and selective labeling of D1R-MSN and D2R-MSNs in NAc, followed by decoding analysis, we will test the hypothesis that D1R-MSN neural representations of social interaction and social reward are degraded and less stable across days in the Cntnap2 and Shank3b mutant animals with social behavioral dysfunction. In Aim 2, using retroAAV-mediated labeling of specific VTA and mPFC inputs to NAc, miniaturized microscopy and multi-fiber photometry, we will test the hypothesis that the mPFC and dopaminergic VTA projections to NAc show degraded, unstable and uncoordinated social representations in the two mutant animals with abnormal social behavior. We will also probe fine-scale synchrony between mPFC and NAc using Neuropixels recordings in freely behaving animals. In Aim 3, we will use activity-dependent ChR2 labeling of NAc neurons activated by social interaction and closed-loop reactivation of these neurons to test whether stabilization of activity during social interaction can prolong and increase the probability of social interactions in both mutant animals with abnormal social behavior. These experiments will validate targets for future neuromodulation and find convergent causes for social dysfunction across different genetic models with social behavioral dysfunction."

Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and the leading cause of disease burden in the U.S. Up
to a third of depressed individuals experience treatment-resistant depression, defined as the failure to achieve
adequate improvement after two or more medication trials. A major advance in the field of psychiatry in the last
20 years is the development of a non-pharmacological option for treatment resistant depression using
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). rTMS has proven an effective treatment modality for those
with medication-resistant depression. While this represents a major advance, about half of patients do not
benefit from rTMS for depression, and it is not clear why. One of the major impediments to optimizing rTMS
and improving the percentage of patients who benefit from rTMS is a lack of understanding with regards to the
basic mechanisms of how and why rTMS works. Prior work in this field has been limited by relying heavily on
non-invasive measures of brain activity (functional MRI, EEG) and behavior to assess the underlying
mechanisms of rTMS. These methods have inherent limitations in spatiotemporal resolution and despite
several decades of research have not uncovered a satisfactory understanding of the mechanisms of action of
rTMS in humans. The current proposal aims to apply a novel approach that combines invasive and
noninvasive methods to evaluate the effects of rTMS with much higher spatiotemporal resolution than has
been possible to date. Intracranial electrodes are surgically implanted for clinical reasons in epilepsy patients,
and this proposal takes advantage of that unique ability to record directly from the human brain during the
administration of stimulation protocols used to treat depression. The goal is to characterize the key
signatures of the brain’s response to repeated doses of rTMS with an unparalleled combination of
spatial and temporal resolution using intracranial recordings. We do this by evaluating the intracranial
effects of focused electrical stimulation to maximize focality and minimize sensory effects (Aim 1), translate
stimulation noninvasively by measuring the intracranial effects of rTMS (Aim 2), and translate intracranial
recordings noninvasively using simultaneously measured scalp EEG (Aim 3). Our central hypothesis is that
rTMS predictably changes evoked responses and oscillatory power locally and in downstream regions, and
these changes accumulate across rTMS sessions in brain regions relevant to depression. If successful, this
project will inform noninvasive EEG signatures of rTMS response that can be traced back to intracranial
physiology. By relating scalp EEG signatures to reliable neural sources, these markers can be leveraged to
optimize current treatments, develop new treatments, and overall markedly improve treatment efficacy."
10849855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Investigating how neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferate, differentiate, and self-organize in the developing brain
in vivo will lead to better understanding of pathogenesis of developmental disabilities, and may provide
important guidance on the design of in vitro brain organoid culture. While the mechanisms of NSC proliferation
and differentiation have been intensively studied, how NSCs spatially self-organize during brain
morphogenesis remains largely unexplored. In this application, the embryonic mouse neocortex is used for
studying NSC spatial organization in vivo. During embryonic development, NSCs within the neocortex undergo
mitosis at the inner surface (i.e. apical surface) of the tissue to self-expand before the onset of neurogenesis.
The amplification of the NSC pool coincides with rapid outward expansion of the neocortex. Mechanisms by
which mitosis at the inner surface is converted into outward expansion of the tissue remain largely unclear. A
recent study from the PI suggests that interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM), a hallmark feature of NSCs,
promotes neocortical expansion via a convergent extension mechanism. Based on this study and additional
preliminary data, three Specific Aims are proposed in this application to elucidate the mechanisms by which
planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling regulates IKNM and neocortical morphogenesis. In Aim A, experiments are
proposed to test two competing models by which PCP signaling regulates IKNM and neocortical
morphogenesis. In Aim B, experiments are designed to test the hypothesis that PCP signaling maintains the
balance of IKNM and cell proliferation by inhibiting nuclear localization of YAP1/TAZ, which are master
regulators of cell proliferation downstream of Hippo signaling and mechanical cues. In Aim C, the role of autism
risk genes in IKNM-dependent neocortical morphogenesis will be examined. This application will bring major
advancement in a severely understudied field, i.e. NSC spatial organization during neocortical morphogenesis.
The basic principles governing NSC spatial organization discovered from this application may provide
important guidance on strategies for in vitro culture of brain organoids, and link autism risk genes to regulation
of NSC spatial organization during early stages of neocortical development."
10878006,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 After apparently successful treatment, Tuberculosis (TB) survivors have a 16.9% of death, a rate 3-fold
higher than age and sex matched controls. In our previous work, we identified that six months after the
completion of successful TB therapy, survivors retained detrimental epigenetic scars that continue to perturb
host immunity and inflammation. In this proposal, using currently enrolling cohorts, we will test our proposal
that these detrimental epigenetic scars induce pathologic inflammation and decrease immune responsiveness,
leading to increased risk of post-TB mortality.
 Our previous work demonstrated that TB induces more than a thousand DNA methylation perturbations
in pathways related to inflammation, TNF, IL-6 and IFN signaling pathways. Functionally, these DNA
methylation perturbations are associated with increased inflammation and decreased immune responsiveness.
Other infections (HIV, CMV, schistosomiasis) also induce long-lasting epigenetic scars, yet, to date, no study
has identified which of these epigenetic scars are associated with post-TB mortality. Therefore, in Aim 1, we
will follow TB patients for 30 months after completion of successful therapy to identify which DNA methylation
marks are associated with post-TB mortality.
 While most immune cells only live a few days or weeks, our previous work demonstrated that DNA
methylation perturbations persist at least 6 months after successful therapy. Animal models and our
preliminary data support the hypothesis that detrimental epigenetic scars occur in progenitor and stem cells. To
test this hypothesis, we will use cutting-edge single cell epigenomic (scATAC) and transcriptomics (scRNA)
sequencing and pseudotime bioinformatic techniques to link progenitor exhausted populations with terminally
exhausted populations.
 Our in vitro preliminary data, demonstrate that activation of the TCA metabolic pathway mediates the
induction of detrimental epigenetic marks and that inhibiting the TCA activation can mitigate infection induced
DNA hyper-methylation and restore immune responsiveness. Therefore, using our established guinea pig TB
model, we will evaluate if inhibitors of the TCA cycle can block or reverse detrimental epigenetic scars and
restore mycobacterial immunity. The elucidation of the specific epigenetic marks that subvert immune
homeostasis and increase the risk of post-TB mortality is a necessary step in the development of adjunctive
host directed therapy to decrease the current high mortality rates that occur after successful TB therapy."
10872162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms in neurological, psychiatric, and other chronic
illnesses; however, it remains poorly understood and undertreated. Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2
infection (PASC) is a novel syndrome characterized by a range of symptoms present four or more weeks after
the acute phase of COVID-19. Among these symptoms, severe fatigue is the most common and debilitating.
Critical hurdles to understanding and treating fatigue include its multidimensional nature and the lack of
quantitative methods to characterize it. In this MOSAIC K99/R00 application, I propose to use a novel `fatigue
paradigm' that leverages neuromuscular, neuroeconomic, and computational methods to objectively investigate
the neurobiological mechanisms of three features of fatigue in healthy individuals and individuals with PASC:
feeling of weariness (how weary one feels), sense of effort (how one perceives a previously exerted force), and
willingness to exert effort (an individual's decision to engage in effortful actions). My central hypothesis is that
fatigue is comprised of at least three separable features, which represent distinct psychophysiological aspects,
have unique neural correlates, and are differentially affected by PASC.
The experiments proposed for the K99 Phase, which will be executed in Dr. Vikram Chib's Neuroeconomic
Laboratory in the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins, will
identify the brain network(s) encoding the features of fatigue in healthy individuals (Aim 1) and investigate how
fatigue manifests in individuals with PASC (Aim 2). Through these projects, and the guidance of my mentoring
team (Drs. Vikram Chib, Karen Quigley, Laura Malone, and Martin Lindquist), I will acquire complementary
expertise in neuroimaging, psychophysiology, and computational and translational neuroscience. In the R00
Phase, I propose to merge my expertise in neuromuscular physiology and motor control with my newly acquired
skills to identify the brain network(s) encoding fatigue in PASC (Aim 3). This Phase will be executed in my own
laboratory upon securing an independent faculty position.
The current epidemiological significance of fatigue and PASC makes this proposal especially timely and
important, as it will significantly advance our understanding of fatigue and contribute to the NIH's RECOVER
initiative. Further, the proposed research and training plans will allow me to accomplish my long-term career goal
of becoming an independent investigator who will distinguish the neurobiological mechanisms of fatigue in
different illnesses and develop targeted clinical interventions."
10892858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Air pollution – including exposure to particulate matter (PM) – is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
the United States and worldwide. However, existing research examining the cardiovascular health effects of
PM2.5 exposure has several limitations, including residual confounding by correlated spatial and temporal
characteristics, and limited or conflicting evidence regarding the extent to which associations between PM2.5
and health outcomes vary according to individual and neighborhood characteristics. Moreover, few national
studies in the U.S. on the cardiovascular effects of PM2.5 have encapsulated a spectrum of health outcomes,
ranging from changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to hospitalizations and mortality. Examining
associations between air pollution and a continuum of cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes contributes to
our understanding of causal mechanisms and sheds light on potential intervention opportunities.
The goal of this K01 award is to address gaps in the literature while also supporting the candidate’s goal of
transitioning to an independent scholar focused on identifying and addressing upstream environmental
determinants of CVD disparities. Through formal coursework, workshops, mentored research, and attendance
at scientific conferences, Dr. Titus will gain expertise in the pathogenesis of pollution-attributable CVD
outcomes, and will pursue methodological training in causal inference, multi-level EHR-based analyses, and
machine learning approaches. Building on Dr. Titus’s prior training as a social epidemiologist, these
complementary training and research aims will allow Dr. Titus to elucidate complex, intersectional patterns of
vulnerability to the health effects of air pollution and will provide her with a combination of methodological tools
that can be flexibly applied to future research questions at the nexus of environmental health, cardiovascular
epidemiology, and health disparities.
The proposed research will leverage EHR data from a large, national cohort of U.S. veterans to examine
associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and CVD disparities within a novel quasi-experimental
framework, exploiting individual-level changes in PM2.5 exposure based on residential mobility. The proposed
aims 1) examine associations between PM2.5 and CVD-related outcomes (changes in SBP, hospitalizations
and mortality) among all veterans, 2) use hypothesis-driven approaches to examine how associations vary
according to socioeconomic status and urbanicity, and 3) use machine learning methods to explore
intersectional patterns of PM2.5-attributable CVD outcomes based on individual and area-level characteristics.
This work is in line with NHLBI’s strategic goals to elucidate drivers of population disparities in CVD and to
pursue novel linkages of large-scale environmental and EHR data. By providing salary support, training, and a
formal mentorship structure, this award will facilitate Dr. Titus’s transition to an independent career focused on
the study of environmentally driven CVD disparities."
10890160,"Meiotic recombination results in the formation of DNA crossovers (CO) that are critical for ensuring the correct
segregation of homologous (maternal and paternal) chromosomes at the first meiotic division. Chromosome
segregation errors show striking sexual dimorphism: In humans, 20-80% of eggs versus 2.5-7% of sperm are
aneuploid, likely due in large part to errors in CO formation. Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation
of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) that are then repaired via various pathways to achieve a tightly regulated
frequency and distribution of COs across the genome. These DSB repair events occur in the context of the
synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure that forms along the chromosome axes, tethering
homolog pairs together. SC length correlates strongly with CO number, and most studies in human and mouse
report females have higher CO rates due to their longer SC length. Paradoxically, meiotic recombination in
females is highly error-prone, implying critical sex differences in CO formation cannot be explained by a
correlation with SC length. I hypothesize that sexual dimorphism in CO rates is the product of key
differences in molecular features of meiotic prophase I, namely the factors that orchestrate meiotic
recombination and chromosome axis assembly. Unlike common laboratory mice (e.g., B6) and humans,
wild-derived PWD male mice have higher CO number despite their shorter SCs, challenging the dogma that
CO rates are inextricably linked to SC length. Thus, I propose to address my hypothesis using mice from
diverse genetic backgrounds to dissect the molecular and genetic factors underlying sexually dimorphic CO
rates. In Aim 1, I will examine dynamic localization of meiotic recombination proteins in male and female PWD
and B6 mice to elucidate how sexually dimorphic CO rates progressively manifest through prophase I. Using
high resolution imaging methods, I will characterize the accumulation of critical DSB repair factors (including
RAD51, RPA2, MSH4, RNF212, and MLH1) to pinpoint sexually dimorphic differences in CO regulation. In
Aim 2, I will evaluate cohesin-mediated chromatin organization in male and female B6 and PWD mice. Using
CUT&Tag to profile REC8 and RAD21L cohesin distributions, I will identify sex differences in cohesin axis
assembly and how they correlate with early DSB repair intermediates. In Aim 3, I will use the recombinant
mouse lines of the Collaborative Cross to map genetic loci associated with sex differences in CO number and
SC length. Collectively, these studies will be the first to examine the molecular and genetic factors that
influence sexually dimorphic CO rate and SC length in diverse mouse genetic backgrounds. Insights gained
from this project will provide critical understanding of why recombination errors are more common in females.
Over the course of this project, I will receive invaluable training in the use of super-resolution microscopy,
computational analysis of genomics data, and quantitative genetics of complex traits. Along with career
development mentoring, these skills will be critical to the development of my independent research program."
10865049,"The goal of this career development award is for the applicant to gain knowledge and technical expertise in
lymphocyte biology in order to advance our understanding of how the interaction between BCL10 and MALT1,
two critically important lymphocyte signaling proteins, influences lymphocyte function and dysfunction.
Knowledge gained during this career development award will provide new insights into the mechanism of
interaction between BCL10 and MALT1 as well as the molecular pathogenesis of immune disorders associated
with MALT1 dysregulation, including psoriasis and colitis. Experiments are designed with the ultimate goal of
determining the therapeutic potential of targeting the BCL10-MALT1 protein-protein interaction in these

10895535,"This application synergizes expertise from two groups, with one specialized in mitochondrial biology and
proteostatic signaling and the other in V-ATPase biochemistry and vacuolar/lysosomal biology. Mitochondria
are multifunctional organelles. In addition to their major role in ATP production, mitochondria are also involved
in other cellular processes including stress signaling and cell death. However, under many pathophysiological
conditions and during aging, to what extent impairment to non-bioenergetic mitochondrial functions contributes
to the decline of cell fitness is poorly understood. We found that various mitochondrial stressors can directly
induce proteostatic stress in the cytosol independent of energy metabolism, by a mechanism named
mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation Stress (mPOS). The mechanisms by which mPOS affects cellular
function and viability remain unknown so far. The lysosome (or vacuole in yeast) also carries out many cellular
functions in the cell, including pH control, ion and amino acid homeostasis, protein degradation, autophagy and
vesicular trafficking. Interestingly, defects in mitochondrial and lysosomal functions can both contribute to cell
aging and aging-associated degenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis. This odd coincidence invites the question of whether damage to mitochondria and lysosomes can
synergize, either sequentially or additively, to affect a common cellular process critical for the fitness and
survival of aged cells. To address this question, it is important to comprehensively describe how mitochondria
and lysosomes interact at the molecular level to affect cellular functions. In this application, we focus on a
novel mitochondria-to-lysosome stress signaling pathway, in which mitochondrial defects cause proteostatic
stress to the vacuole/lysosome thereby affecting cell survival. The scientific premise of this application is based
on our strong preliminary data from studies in yeast, cultured human cells and transgenic mice. More
specifically, the Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that specific mitochondrial stress can cause
severe proteostatic damage to the yeast vacuole. The genetic amenability of the yeast system will enable us to
discover genes that suppress the mitochondria-to-vacuole stress signaling and possibly, extend cell’s lifespan.
In Aim 2, we will validate this novel mitochondria-to-lysosome stress signaling pathway in cultured mammalian
cells. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that mitochondrial stress causes lysosomal damage and affects
tissue homeostasis in vivo, using a unique mouse model that we recently developed. We will determine the
mechanism of the mitochondria-induced lysosomal damage in post-mitotic tissues. Success of our experiments
may unravel a novel mechanism of cell demise that involves mitochondria-to-lysosome stress signaling. The
results may ultimately help the better understanding of many aging-associated diseases that are co-manifested
by mitochondrial and lysosomal defects."
10907780,"Alcohol’s ability to improve mood in the face of stress is among its most prized reinforcing properties, long held
by researchers to be of critical importance for the understanding of the etiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Drinkers overwhelmingly report that the mood-enhancement they gain from alcohol is most pronounced in the
context of stress, and individuals who report higher levels of stress relief from alcohol are at risk for developing
AUD. But attempts to capture this key element of alcohol reinforcement using experimental methods have
yielded strikingly inconsistent results. One remarkable feature of the extant experimental literature is that, in
attempting to capture alcohol’s stress-relieving effects, researchers have strayed far outside the range of
stressors typically encountered in everyday drinking settings, contexts that are overwhelmingly social in
nature. Here, we harness the power of stressful stimuli that emerge naturally within everyday contexts,
focusing on social novelty as a compound stress-trigger ubiquitous to real-world heavy drinking settings.
Building on our prior work indicating enhanced alcohol reward in novel compared with familiar social context,
together with pilot findings pointing to potential links between social novelty and hazardous patterns of
drinking, we draw on innovative methods and measures to further build the understanding of social-contextual
factors driving consumption. Specifically, we leverage multi-participant neuroimaging recording arrays (i.e.,
hyperscanning) to pinpoint both inter- and intra-brain processes underlying alcohol reinforcement, a
mechanistic analysis we complement with ambulatory and longitudinal methods for tracing real world patterns
of consumption. Participants (N=240) will attend two experimental laboratory sessions, on one of which they
will consume alcohol and on the other a control beverage. Participants will complete tasks in the company of
either a stranger or familiar individual while EEG is recorded from both participants simultaneously.
Participants will also engage in a 14-day ambulatory assessment period during which drinking will be assessed
continuously via transdermal alcohol biosensor while social context is explored via in-vivo photographic image-
capture methods. Finally, longitudinal changes in hazardous drinking and AUD symptoms will be assessed for
24 months post-baseline. The aims of the project are to: 1) Explore diminished threat sensitivity and enhanced
social engagement as mechanisms driving alcohol reward in novel social context; 2) Examine social reward-
attentive processes as well as social-contextual novelty as predictors of hazardous drinking and AUD. The
proposed research contributes to the understanding of AUD by addressing one of the most fundamental
questions in the alcohol literature—the question of why people drink. Further, representing a critical step
towards building a contextually-informed, mechanistically precise model of AUD etiology, the proposed study
might have a variety of key implications including for refining harm-reduction and prevention programs,
reducing rates of relapse, informing public health policy, and the early identification of those at risk."
10910215,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-specific/non-pharmacologic therapeutic effects can improve health outcomes, however, little is known
about how to maximize these effects, particularly for effects related to patient-clinician interactions. These
effects are especially important in treating chronic pain. Preliminary studies indicate that both increased visit
length and augmented visit content (designed to elicit a holistic understanding of the individual) enhance non-
specific effects related to patient-clinician interactions, but it is unclear which of these factors is more important
or if their interaction is synergistic. This proposal’s long-term goal is to advance the science of non-specific
therapeutic effects related to patient-clinician interactions to improve health outcomes. Its objective is to
quantify the relative effects of, and mechanisms by which, increased visit length and augmented visit content
affect patient-clinician interactions and health outcomes in knee osteoarthritis (OA). Knee OA is an ideal
condition for studying the effects of visit length and content on patient-clinician interactions and health
outcomes because it is a leading cause of chronic pain and disability in older adults, many common treatments
have poor safety profiles, and clinical trials of medications for knee OA suggest that non-specific therapeutic
effects account for a major component of treatment effects. The central hypothesis is that both increased visit
length and augmented visit content will increase the non-specific treatment effects associated with diclofenac
gel (a standard topical treatment for knee OA-related pain). Project specific aims are: 1) To determine whether
increased visit length and/or augmented visit content increase the non-specific treatment effects of diclofenac
gel on knee OA pain and function; 2) To determine how visit length and content affect patient and clinician
behaviors and physiology during patient-clinician interactions; and 3) To determine whether patient COMT
genotype modifies the effects of increased visit length and augmented visit content on knee pain. The approach
is innovative in that there are few randomized trials targeting non-specific effects associated with patient-
clinician interactions, and none that directly test the effects of visit length and content on health outcomes or use
physiologic measures to assess patient-clinician interactions. The proposed study is significant because it will
determine the relative contributions of visit length and content on health outcomes in knee OA and advance
understanding of potential clinical, behavioral, physiologic, and genetic mechanisms through which non-
specific effects impact health outcomes. This project advances a line of research focused on improving
outcomes in knee OA by developing and testing strategies to modify clinical care delivery to maximize non-
specific therapeutic effects associated with patient-clinician interactions. It will also help develop new research
approaches for studying patient-clinician interactions. Insights gained from this project will also be relevant to
other chronic and painful conditions, may help reduce polypharmacy among older adults, and will advance
understanding of the roles of non-specific therapeutic effects in health outcomes."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting CTLA-4 or PD-1 rapidly assumed its role as a standard treatment
for solid tumors and can lead to dramatic, long-lasting responses; nonetheless, fewer than 30% of patients
respond to monotherapy with either agent. Combination therapy results in better long-term survival outcomes,
but also causes more frequent and severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Several novel
immunotherapies are currently being explored to evaluate their anti-tumor capacity. Crucially however, most of
these targets suffer from on-target, off-cell effects, as other immune cell types can express high levels of these
molecules. Hence, as low overall response rates, off-cell effects and widespread immune related toxicity severely
limit both treatment efficacy and monotherapy and combination therapy options, there is urgent need to develop
novel immunotherapy targets that exhibit a more restricted expression profile. We have recently demonstrated
that PD-1+ follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells were prevalent in tumor tissues of several cancer types in humans
and mice, and that they were critical cellular determinants of anti-PD-1 treatment efficacy. TFR cells were primarily
located within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and exhibited superior suppressive capacity and in vivo
persistence when compared to regulatory T (TREG) cells, suggesting a key role for TFR cells in impairing patient
survival and impeding immunotherapy treatment efficacy. While we have shown that intratumoral TFR cells derive
from TREG precursor cells, the mechanisms and transcription factors (TFs) that are driving this differentiation step
are largely unknown. In Aim1, we propose to employ single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq and micro-
scaled ChIP assays to fully characterize the transcriptomic signatures of tumor-infiltrating TREG cells, transitioning
(4-1BB+) TREG cells and TFR cells. Elucidating the enhancer profiles in different developmental stages of TREG to
TFR differentiation is likely to provide crucial insights into the TFs that instruct this differentiation step. These
analyses will define genes and TFs that are pivotal for the heightened suppressive capacity of TFR cells, as well
as for their maintenance or differentiation. Strategies to deplete TREG cells or to curb their functionality with the
aim of enhancing anti-tumor immunity are being intensively investigated. Crucially however, most of these
approaches are based on antibodies (i.e., ADCC-optimized for TREG cell depletion; i.e. anti-CTLA-4), which have
an inherently long half-life in vivo, thus increasing the likelihood of causing irAEs. Conversely, our data imply that
alternative dosing regimens of Phosphoinositide 3-kinase δ (PI3Kδ) inhibitors might offer a pathway to target TFR
cells more specifically. We propose that PI3Kδ represents a novel and appealing immunotherapy target in solid
tumors. In Aim 2 and Aim 3, we will assess whether alternative dosing regimens of PI3Kd inhibitors can be
utilized to effectively and safely exploit the immunomodulatory impact of PI3Kδ inhibitors in solid cancers and
whether a transient depletion or inhibition of TFR cells might suffice to restrict the immunosuppressive milieu in
the tumor and thus drive anti-tumor immunity without causing toxicity."

Ras is the most mutated oncoprotein and functions at the center of an evolutionarily conserved
network of proteins mutated in the RASopathy spectrum of heritable developmental disorders.
Certain facets of Ras biology, like signaling cascades downstream of the Raf and PI3K oncogenic
effectors, are among the best studied and pharmacologically targeted signals in all of biology. Yet
how Ras switches between different effectors and the roles of the oncogenic RalGEF>Ral effector
during development are poorly understood due to paralog redundancy, technical limitations in
more complex systems, and the roadblock of Ral using the exocyst complex as a signaling
intermediary. Research in this laboratory focuses on understanding the composition,
organizational principles, and functions of signal transduction networks in vivo. This proposal will
support a series of projects to answer how Ras switches between effectors in different
developmental contexts, explore unexpected signaling relationships with other characterized
signaling cascades, untangle the apparently paradoxical relationship between Ral and the
exocyst complex in signaling vs. exocytosis, and to identify and understand novel functions of
RalGEF>Ral signaling in development and physiology, about which surprisingly little is known.
The laboratory has developed several crucial technical advances to overcome barriers to
progress in this field. The proposed projects build on the lab’s ability dissect complex webs of
signal transduction using genetic principles, complemented by cell biological and biochemical
approaches. The proposed research is reasonably expected to discover novel principles and
components in signal transduction."

10874772,"Abstract. With a mortality rate of over 50%, high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) requires improved therapy, including
safer and more complete resection of aggressive, poorly circumscribed tumors and their often remote, difficult
to locate lymph node metastases. Thus, there is a critical need for new intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI)
agents that will allow identification of NB and aid in preservation of adjacent vital structures. The long-term
goal of our research is to develop an IMI tracer for use in NB (and other tumors) to improve the outcomes and
safety of surgical resection. The objective of this study is to evaluate a novel, dual-labeled IMI tracer to guide NB
identification and safe resection. We therefore hypothesize that a dual-labeled IMI tracer can be optimized for
intraoperative detection and safe removal of NB. The first aim will focus on optimizing a dual-labeled IMI
tracer specifically for intraoperative use. In the second aim, tumor and tissue heterogeneity will be studied to
determine their effects on IMI tracer performance. In the final aim, we will evaluate the impact of the IMI tracer
on extent of resection and survival in a transgenic mouse model and a rat model of NB with or without
neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies. If successful with the proposed studies, our IMI tracer should allow
surgeons to perform safer and more complete resection of NB, leading to improved patient outcomes. NB surgery
is among the most challenging operations to confront the pediatric surgeon due to extensive spread of disease
and the intimate relationship between the tumor and normal, vital structures. The surgeon faces these challenges
today with the same tools they have used for over a century, visualization and manual palpation. We propose a
new solution to this problem with a novel dual-labeled molecular tracer for specific detection of NB. This novel,
substantively different approach to intraoperative identification and detection of NB will enable more efficacious
surgery, thereby opening new horizons in the application of IMI agents for pediatric cancer surgery."
10894102,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Gradient-recalled echo (GRE)–based echo planar imaging (EPI) has been the gold standard functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique for nearly three decades due to its ability to rapidly acquire whole
brain volumes with MR T2* sensitivity to blood oxygenation — a well-known surrogate marker for brain activity.
This immensely utilized technique, however, suffers from high acoustic noise, ghosting and motion artifacts,
magnetic field inhomogeneity–related artifacts, low sensitivity compared to other neuroimaging modalities, and
poor spatial specificity. An fMRI sampling technique that addresses these problems has the potential to change
day-to-day fMRI practices. In particular, such a development would be of great benefit to the emerging rodent
fMRI community as anesthesia and stress confounds can be avoided. Additionally, most rodent fMRI studies are
performed under high magnetic field strengths (> 7T), wherein susceptibility artifacts in GRE-EPI are
exacerbated. Imaging sequences with “zero” acquisition delay and minimal increment of gradients are insensitive
to problems stated above and have the potential to provide superior specificity and sensitivity compared to GRE-
EPI-fMRI. The overarching goal of this project is to advance, validate, and disseminate a novel 3D brain-
wide imaging sequence: Steady-state On-the-Ramp Detection of INduction-decay signal with Oversampling
(SORDINO) for the preclinical animal fMRI community. In addition, we will investigate SORDINO contrast
mechanisms and explore a contrast-enhanced method that may further augment SORDINO sensitivity. Our
developments will be benchmarked in mice, wherein a head-fixation approach can be utilized to image mice in
an awake condition. In Aim 1, we will develop and disseminate the SORDINO sequence and reconstruction
package in a preclinical animal MRI platform. In Aim 2, we will inform the most robust imaging parameters and
benchmark them against modeled SORDINO performance and GRE-EPI-fMRI and zero echo time (ZTE)-fMRI
data. This will facilitate future SORDINO-fMRI applications and enable new capabilities to study large-scale,
functionally and behaviorally relevant brain networks in awake mice. In Aim 3, we will examine the SORDINO
contrast mechanisms using MR-compatible invasive recordings, which are crucial for data interpretation. The
contrast mechanisms, if proven to be local tissue oxygenation, cerebral blood flow, and cerebral blood volume,
will clarify SORDINO as a spatially specific approach for functional brain mapping. In Aim 4, we will leverage the
expected sensitivity gain of SORDINO at shorter baseline T1 values and use a simple manganese-enhanced
MRI (MEMRI) strategy, a method widely utilized by many preclinical MRI labs, to further augment awake mouse
SORDINO-fMRI sensitivity. Overall, we expect the knowledge and deliverables in this work to have widespread
implications and will significantly advance fMRI technologies. We also expect this work to have extended impacts
on studies requiring rapid mapping of T1 changes such as dynamic-contrast-enhanced MRI and molecular MRI."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by membrane instability, calcium influx, and necrosis of
myocytes. In the heart, progressive breakdown of cardiomyocytes causes fibrosis and an insidious dilated
cardiomyopathy. Heart failure is the primary cause of death in patients with DMD, which occurs around the
third decade despite traditional cardiosupportive therapeutics. Our preliminary research suggests that signaling
from the thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (TPr) in the heart is a driving force leading to cardiomyocyte death
and fibrosis, and preventing this activity may preserve cardiac function in muscular dystrophy patients. Our
group has found that blocking TPr activity with the antagonist ifetroban improves survival, cardiac function, and
cardiac fibrosis in two mouse models of severe DMD and a model of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. Based on
these studies, a Phase 2 clinical study of ifetroban in DMD patients is currently recruiting. However, key
knowledge gaps exist. We know that TPr activation leads to fibrosis with enhanced tumor growth factor (TGF)-
β activity, but not how it activates TGFβ. Here we will test the hypothesis that TPr activation mediates TGF-β
release from the large latent complex, leading to cardiac fibrosis. We will test this in the context of TPr
blockade or deletion, using mdx/utrn(+/-) mice or mdx mice containing latent TGF-β binding protein-4 (LTBP4)
polymorphism, and confirm with isolated fibroblasts. Our early data also suggests that the mechanism by which
TPr regulates cardiomyocyte membrane stability, arrhythmia, and cardiac function may be distinct from this.
We hypothesize this occurs via regulation of calcium influx and calcium-activated signaling, and that
antagonism improves this in mdx/utrn(+/-) mice in a manner additive with standard-of-care therapies. A DMD
mouse model containing a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of TPr will separate cardiomyocyte-initiated from
fibroblast effects. Finally, our ongoing trial presents a unique opportunity to assess molecular outcomes
longitudinally in human patients, and identify biomarkers to reflect the cardiac response to TPr antagonism. For
this aim, we will do expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from DMD patient participants in
the ifetroban clinical trial, compared with response to treatment. Resolving these questions will illuminate the
role of the TPr in DMD cardiomyopathy, anticipate human response and mechanism of TPr antagonism in
DMD patients, and could provide valuable surrogate endpoints for drug response."

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) occur when there is an unfortunate combination of microbial dysbiosis and
genetic susceptibility. Downregulation of Vitamin D receptor (VDR), a host factor, promotes the severity, extent,
and duration of mucosal inflammation and dysbiosis. However, most studies examining gut microbiota have
primarily relied on fecal or colonic luminal samples. In contrast, few studies have considered the roles of the
small intestinal microbiome. Classically, Paneth cells located in the small intestine are a significant source of
antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and proteins important in host defense. Although Paneth cells are located in the
small intestine, AMPs are released to the entire intestine, thus shaping the gut microbiome. VDR regulation of
gut bacterial pathogenesis has become an emerging area in IBD, however, the aspect of small intestinal
microbiome and metabolites has yet to be explored. Given the challenges in treating patients with Crohn’s
disease and the limited studies on the small intestinal microbiome, it is critical to understand how Paneth cell
VDR is involved in microbial homeostasis, balanced metabolites, and innate immunity. The objective of our
current R01 proposal is to study regulatory mechanisms of Paneth cell VDR and to restore microbiome /
metabolites in inflamed states. Our preliminary data showed Paneth cell VDR conditional knockout (VDRΔPC)
leads to dysbiosis and susceptibility to Salmonella-induced colitis. We established a method to purify Paneth
cells and study their alertness to bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, conditional VDR deletion severely changed
the metabolite profile. However, the complex mechanisms in the ileitis through the Paneth cell VDR are still
unknown. We hypothesize that VDR deficiency in Paneth cells alters the microbiome/metabolites and
makes the host susceptible to chronic intestinal inflammation (e.g., ileitis). We have designed two Aims to
rigorously examine the hypotheses at the cellular and microbiome levels: Aim 1. Define the mechanism by which
VDR maintains healthy Paneth cells and impacts ileitis inflammation. Aim 2. Investigate the role of Paneth cell
VDR in altering the microbiome / metabolites and define the mechanism of VDR in restoring microbial
homeostasis, when administering microbiome via fecal transplantation or recolonization in originally germ-free
mice. Specifically, we will use novel animal models, organoids from human IBD biopsies, and statistical and
bioinformatic tools to understand the host factors and aspects of microbiome / metabolites in chronic intestinal
inflammation. Our research team includes experts in the following areas: epithelial biology, animal models,
clinical gastroenterology, and microbiome. Our studies are innovative because we provide a unifying
hypothesis that can potentially account for defective a host factor in VDR signaling pathway, abnormal Paneth
cells, and dysbiosis in IBD. Cutting edge technologies and models will be employed to gain greater mechanistic
insights into the interrelationships among VDR, microbiome, and metabolites in inflammation. This study will fill
the knowledge gap and provide novel treatment by targeting microbiome / metabolites in IBD and other disorders."

Acetaminophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol or APAP) is recommended as a safe treatment to reduce pain and
fever during pregnancy. An estimated 45-65% of pregnant people reported intake of APAP in the U.S., but there
has been little data on safety for potential health effects in the prenatally exposed offspring. APAP
placental
can cross the
barrier reaching the fetus which has limited capacity to metabolize the compound in early development.
Recent experimental studies demonstrated compelling evidence suggesting APAP can induce anti-androgenic
effects potentially affecting fetal brain development. The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration have called for a more thorough investigation and better data to guide the safety of
APAP use in pregnancy. Our experienced and multidisciplinary team proposes to leverage the rich data collected
in the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) and records from the Danish population medical registries to
investigate the potential effects of APAP exposures on fetal development. In Aim 1, we will study 64,322 mother-
child pairs enrolled in the DNBC and investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to APAP on a wide spectrum
of neurodevelopmental outcomes, ascertained at multiple time points from infancy through age 18. Six domains
of outcomes will be examined, including milestones in infancy, craniofacial markers, neurobehavioral disorders,
motor function, school performance, and mental health. A rich set of confounding factors, including maternal
illnesses and familial/genetic risks, will be examined in a robust multi-stage analytical framework. In addition, we
will evaluate the effect of post-natal APAP exposure on neurodevelopment (aim 1a), the effect of APAP
exposures on childhood ADHD, adjusting for the genetic risk of ADHD (aim 1b), and explore whether APAP
exposures affect distinct neuropsychiatric phenotypes and/or behavioral trajectories across childhood and
adolescence (aim 1c). In Aim 2, we will investigate the influence of prenatal co-medication exposures with APAP
and their impacts on neurodevelopment. We will examine whether medications that co-occur with APAP use
during pregnancy confound the associations between APAP exposure and child neurodevelopment. We will also
examine the joint effects of co-medications exposures. We will focus on a list of common medications (7 major
and 15 subclasses) that impact fetal growth and/or brain development documented in the literature. This timely
research project will provide strong and scientifically rigorous data to inform long-term health effects of early life
exposure to APAP on child neurodevelopment. This is also the most extensive cohort study investigating
maternal polypharmacy exposure effects on offspring neurodevelopment. Our findings will contribute to
regulatory recommendations and policymaking decisions for APAP, a widely consumed medication in pregnancy,
as well as related co-medication use."

 The endogenous opioid system is involved in many diverse biological processes and contributes to a range
of disorders that have enormous health and societal consequences such as opioid use disorder, pain, and major
depressive disorder. The endogenous opioid system consists of dozens of opioid peptides derived from three
distinct precursor proteins, and three cell surface receptors that are activated by these peptides as well as by
opiates and synthetic drugs. Recently, ketamine has emerged as an effective treatment for both major
depressive disorder and chronic pain, and may also be effective in treating opioid use disorder. While ketamine’s
anesthetic actions are due to its inhibition of a subtype of glutamate receptors, the mechanisms of its other
biological effects remain elusive. Studies from our laboratory and other groups have found that ketamine
interacts with the endogenous opioid system, however the full scope of these interactions is not known.
Moreover, a single dose of ketamine produces rapid effects within minutes/hours, as well as sustained effects
that last days/weeks. The long-term effects are remarkable and unlike the anesthetic action of ketamine which
correlates with plasma levels. Our central hypothesis is that ketamine interacts with the endogenous
opioid system to produce both rapid and long-term effects. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary
data showing that ketamine acts as a positive allosteric modulator of opioid receptors to synergize with
endogenous opioid peptides.
 Our central hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims that are highly interrelated. Aim 1A will
characterize the activity of ketamine as an allosteric modulator of the endogenous opioid system using cultured
cells and membrane preparations. These studies will investigate short- and long-term effects of ketamine
(including racemic ketamine and the stereoisomers S- and R-ketamine) and major bioactive metabolites
(norketamine and hydroxynorketamine). Using electrophysiology in brain slices, Aim 1B will measure acute
effects of ketamine on opioid receptor-mediated signaling and persistent changes induced by in vivo ketamine
administration. Aim 2A will test the interaction of ketamine with highly purified preparations of opioid receptors.
Aim 2B will determine the cryoEM structure of the mu opioid receptor in complex with ketamine and a peptide
ligand. Aim 3 will examine the effect of ketamine on the levels of endogenous opioid peptides in mouse brain.
 Collectively, these studies will provide a solid understanding of the interactions of ketamine with the
endogenous opioid system, providing mechanisms to account for the rapid and long-term effects of this drug.
Historically, understanding the molecular targets of drugs have led to insights into the pathophysiology of disease
and novel therapeutics. Because little is known regarding the mechanism(s) of ketamine as an antidepressant
and analgesic, and the comorbidity of these diseases with opioid use disorder, our studies to determine the
interaction of ketamine and the endogenous opioid system are highly relevant to human health."

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which T cells target insulin-producing β cells. At least 60
non-HLA genetic variants each confer small increases in T1D risk. While abnormal negative selection has
been implicated in NOD mice, the possible role of aberrant thymic selection in driving human T1D is unknown.
Human immune system (HIS) mice in which a patient’s immune system is generated de novo from their
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), known as the personalized immune mouse (PIM) model, provide a unique
opportunity to evaluate thymic selection events that contribute to T1D, permitting assessment of immune
repertoire development and experimental manipulations such as T cell receptor (TCR) transgenesis. Our
preliminary data suggest that non-HLA genetic variants associated with human T1D susceptibility confer both
impaired negative selection and impaired Treg diversion of autoreactive thymocytes. By comparing T1D- and
healthy control (HC)-derived PI mice, we have identified abnormalities in the thymic selection of two
structural varieties of TCR in T1D immune systems. One (Type I) is characterized by longer than average
CDR3βs with more hydrophobic amino acids and higher self-affinity and is normally most abundant in the Treg
subset. Inserting a high affinity Type I insulin-reactive TCR (Clone 5) into HC HSCs resulted in clonal deletion
or Treg diversion of thymocytes with this TCR. However, both processes are defective in T1D immune
systems, resulting in entry of the islet autoreactive T cells into the peripheral repertoire only in T1D-derived
immune systems. The second (Type II) is characterized by shorter CDR3β regions with few hydrophobic
amino acids and shows greater islet autoreactive clonal survival in T1D compared to HC immune systems.
Single cell RNAseq identified a major thymocyte population undergoing negative selection that highly
expresses TCR signaling and pro-apoptotic genes. This cluster was virtually absent among T1D thymocytes,
indicating a profound defect in the distal signaling pathways regulating thymic deletion. This impairment was
associated with T1D susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms in SH2B3 and Erk/MAP kinase pathway
genes. The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the genetic control and abnormalities in thymic
selection involved in the development of the autoimmune repertoires that mediate T1D. We propose to: 1):
Further characterize defective thymocyte selection and identify the HSC-intrinsic, non-HLA genetically-
determined TCR signaling defects in T1D that result in impaired negative selection and impaired Treg
differentiation. We will also define pathogenic roles of Type I and Type II TCRs in T1D immune systems with
autologous iPSC-derived β-cell grafts; 2) Utilize transgenic autoreactive TCRs and specific antigen-MHC
tetramers to directly assess the extent of aberrant negative selection and Treg redirection in T1D-derived
immune systems. Collectively, these studies will lead to novel insights into the mechanisms by which HLA and
non-HLA risk alleles predispose to thymic selection of a T cell repertoire that causes islet autoimmunity."
10891699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cortical ER structure is a key aspect of oocyte quality as exemplified in mammals where unique `ER clusters'
become positioned in close proximity to the plasma membrane (PM). Our recent in vivo studies demonstrate
the presence of hereto unknown actin fenestrae within cortical actin layer, in addition the ER clusters were
centrally located within these fenestrae and sperm binding occurred preferentially over these fenestrae.
Another novel observation was that upon sperm fusion the oocyte ER clusters undergo a maturational event
involving an increase in volume, docking to fenestrae in the actin layer. This led us to a hypothesis that the PM
overlying ER clusters is enriched in sperm binding proteins that promote close interaction between the sperm,
oocyte PM, and the ER cluster. Temporal and mechanistic studies are necessary to elucidate the role of the
oocyte cortical actin fenestrae in the establishment of sperm binding sites as well as the role of the sperm
PLCζ released from the sperm head in mediating the ER cluster maturational changes. The presence of
unique actin fenestrae led to a second hypothesis that actin remodeling proteins, RhoA and cdc42, could
modulate sperm binding sites, cortical ER cluster formation via the actin fenestrae. Lastly, we observed that
oocytes from aged female mice exhibited abnormal ER structure and varied considerably in their ability to form
ER clusters in response to fertilization. This finding led us to propose a third hypothesis where maternal aging
disrupts actin fenestrae and Ca2+ oscillations, causing defects in ER cluster maturation and reduced fertility.
Our findings suggest a new paradigm wherein the oocyte responds to sperm binding/fusion by ER cluster
maturation, then establishes close interaction with the sperm during its incorporation into the egg. Testing of
the hypotheses presented in this proposal will lead to an enhanced understanding of the fertilization process,
and potential mechanisms for improving Assisted Reproduction Technologies such as ICSI and protocols for
reproductively aged oocytes as well as potential new contraceptive targets that block fertilization."

Long-term and chronic visual suppression to the visual input from the non-preferred eye is a key factor in
developing amblyopia, or “lazy eye”, as well as a critical barrier to treat amblyopia. Amblyopia is commonly
caused by misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), chronic optical blur in one eye due to unequal refractive
errors in two eyes (anisometropia), or a mixture of strabismus and anisometropia during early childhood,
affecting about 3% to 5% of the population worldwide. Our long-term goal is to understand how and where
suppression occurs in the brain. We propose that selective visual attention plays a role in visual suppression.
Our hypothesis in the current proposal is that selective visual attention biases competition between eyes and
modulates interocular suppression by selectively facilitating responses from the preferred eye and suppressing
responses from the non-preferred eye along the visual cortical hierarchy. To test our hypothesis, we will use
psychophysics to measure whether valid cueing of the stimulus in the amblyopic eye reduces suppression under
dichoptic viewing in adults with amblyopia, compared with invalid/neutral cueing (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will
use frequency-tagged EEG source imaging along with behavioral measures of perceptual eye dominance during
binocular rivalry to compare the effects of selective attention and increased contrast to the amblyopic eye on
perception and neural responses. We will simultaneously measure and compare the neural activities along the
cortical hierarchy of both eyes under the states of visual perceptual dominance and suppression in adults with
amblyopia and normal vision. These measures will help determine: 1) how and where the brain suppresses
visually conflicting images in amblyopia; 2) how an increase in bottom-up visual salience by increasing the
contrast input to the amblyopic eye changes the neural representation of the amblyopic eye signal and 3)
whether paying attention to the amblyopic eye has a similar effect on neural activity as increasing contrast to
the amblyopic eye. In Aim 3, we will use frequency-tagged EEG source imaging coupled with visual
psychophysics to measure cortical activity and behavioral performance during a multiple-object tracking task
with moving targets presented to one eye and moving distractors presented to the other eye. This aim will
comprehensively characterize: 1) whether visual attention modulates interocular suppression by selectively
facilitating neural responses from the preferred eye and suppressing responses from the non-preferred eye
along the visual cortical hierarchy (Aim 3a); 2) whether there are differences in attentional modulation
between normal and amblyopic vision, in terms of temporal dynamics (Aim 3b) and attentional resource
availability determined by the number of targets to be tracked (Aim 3c). The proposed studies will
systematically investigate visual perception and neural correlates underlying interocular suppression to
provide an integrated picture of visual suppression in amblyopia at physiological levels along the cortical
hierarchy as well as perceptual levels. Knowledge gained from our planned studies would help us better
understand how and where amblyopic suppression occurs and in turn, will help identify therapeutic strategies
for amblyopia."

Genome integrity is essential to life. Considerable efforts are made to maintain the stability of genomes. Yet
genomes also undergo constant changes, often random and small in scale, providing mechanisms for evolution
and adaptation. In contrast, programmed DNA elimination is a dramatic form of genome change with large
amounts of DNA, ranging from 0.5 to 95% of the genome, eliminated during development. DNA elimination is
highly selective and reproducible and is an integral part of biology for diverse organisms, including single-cell
ciliates, a variety of multicellular organisms across animal phyla and some plants. The broad phylogenetic
distribution suggests DNA elimination has evolved independently and has important biological functions. A
common theme for metazoan DNA elimination is the removal of both germline-expressed genes and repetitive
sequences. This suggests that a possible function of DNA elimination in metazoa is to permanently silence
certain germline sequences potentially harmful to somatic cells. Despite progress in genomics and cytology,
functional and mechanistic studies of metazoan DNA elimination are limited, largely due to the lack of genetic
and functional tools. Recently, we built upon and extended a genomic observation and established a genetic and
functional model for DNA elimination in the free-living nematode Oscheius tipulae, a member of the Rhabditidae
family, which includes Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that DNA elimination in O. tipulae occurs during 8-16
cell embryos. We identified and characterized a conserved sequence (Sequence For Elimination, SFE) motif
associated with the DNA break sites and demonstrated its direct role in DNA elimination. DNA breaks occur
within the motif, followed by end resection and telomere healing. Additional breaks occur simultaneously in the
eliminated DNA, perhaps serving as a fail-safe mechanism for DNA elimination. We revealed the abundance
and variations of this motif in many wild isolates of O. tipulae from around the world. In this proposal, we will (1)
study the functions of DNA elimination in O. tipulae by characterizing the fail-to-eliminate phenotypes from
CRISPR edited SFE mutants. We will use RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and small RNA sequencing to determine the
changes of RNA expression and silencing mechanisms in these mutants. We will also (2) study the molecular
mechanisms of O. tipulae DNA elimination by investigating the sequence and genomic position required for SFEs
using CRISPR, as well as proteins that interact with SFEs using in vitro biochemistry, bioinformatic predictions,
and genetics. We will further (3) study the variations of DNA elimination by building telomere-to-telomere
genomes for divergent strains of O. tipulae, identifying SFEs, and carrying out comparative genomics. Overall,
this proposal will use our established genetic model in the free-living nematode O. tipulae to examine the
functions, mechanisms, and variations of DNA elimination. This work will reveal insights into the molecular details
of DNA elimination in a metazoan."

It is well established that the increasing lifespan in the US is leading to increased prevalence of brain diseases
and mental illnesses, with dementia and Alzheimer’s posing significant challenges to the healthcare system.
Because brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a powerful noninvasive tool for clinical studies and
research on fundamental mechanisms of brain maladies and metal disorders, it is expected to play an
important role in addressing this challenge. However, current brain PET technologies are limited with relatively
low sensitivity and low spatial resolution, constraining its usefulness in this context. Consequently, there is a
critical need to improve quantitative imaging performance of brain PET. To address this need, we propose to
develop advanced detector modules and associated algorithms, leveraging in particular recent progress in
time-of-flight (TOF) detector technologies. These modules will lay the foundation for a follow-on project to
develop an ultra-high-performance dedicated whole-brain TOF-PET camera (BRAIN PET EXPLORER) for
research and clinical work. This device will overcome the current technology shortcomings by providing
substantial gain in effective sensitivity and much higher spatial resolution imaging over the most current
advanced brain PET system (NeuroEXPLORER commissioned in 2022). The crucial factor for improved
performance of TOF-PET is better coincidence time resolution (CTR - time difference between arrival of the
two annihilation photons) enabling accurate localization of the annihilation event a line-of-response. Our
research is innovative because the goal of this proof-of-concept proposal is to build and demonstrate these
novel and advanced thin-slab TOF-PET detector modules, and establish their suitability for scale up in a full
BRAIN PET EXPLORER (future work). These detector modules will establish CTR <100 ps FWHM performance,
enabling an 8× gain in effective sensitivity and outstanding 3D event localization (compared to the current
state-of-art scanners) at reduced cost. An additional factor of up to 2× boost in effective sensitivity is expected
to be achieved by accurate determination of the point-of-first-interaction for annihilation photons that undergo
Compton scatter between detector blocks. The overall > 8× increase in the effective sensitivity can be used to
reduce the activity of radiotracer administered to the patient, reduce the examination duration, increase spatial
resolution, or increase the temporal resolution in dynamic brain-PET imaging. All these factors will make the
brain-PET a more useful, cost-effective and affordable research and clinical tool. The advent of such innovative
brain PET technology will help address growing prevalence of brain diseases and mental illnesses facing the
aging population of the US.

 Studies have established the critical roles of a superfamily of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in
hydrolyzing cAMP and its subcellular distribution. We aim to explore the role of PDEs in differential regulation
of the cAMP signals at the plasma membrane and in the nucleus. Specifically, we will uncover the regulation of
the nuclear cAMP signals under the CNS β2-adrenergic receptor (b2AR) stimulation in hippocampal (HC)
neurons during learning and memory. Interestingly, PDE4 inhibitors benefit learning and memory in rodents
and humans, indicating that PDE4 may control the βAR-induced cAMP signal in the nucleus. PDE4D isoforms
are associated with β2AR to fine-tune subcellular cAMP-PKA signals in fibroblasts and myocytes, and PDE4D5
is associated with an AKAP95/PKA complex in the nucleus. Our preliminary data show that βAR stimulation
promotes the nuclear export of PDE4D5 in HC neurons. This relocation of PDE4D5 depends on endosome
GRK-phosphorylated b2AR and is critically necessary for delivering cAMP signals into the nucleus. Besides the
GRK-phosphorylated b2AR, we have recently characterized another distinct subpopulation of b2AR that are
PKA-phosphorylated and located at the PM after agonist stimulation in HC neurons. We hypothesize that two
b2AR subpopulations synergistically promote nuclear cAMP signal by arrestin3-dependent export of PDE4D5
from the nucleus. We will characterize the mechanisms underlying the PDE4D5-dependent regulation of
nuclear cAMP signaling and gene expression and how the regulation may affect the b2AR signaling in learning
and memory (Aim 3). This proposed study will define the role of PDE4D5 in nuclear cAMP signaling, gene
expression, and learning and memory, which not only offer new strategies to treat disorders associated with
the CNS adrenergic system but also offer an example to study many other Gs-coupled receptors, such as
dopamine receptors in the regulation of gene expression."

Dendritic cells are the sentinels of the immune system. They patrol the body looking for antigens and then
migrate to a lymph node to communicate what they found to T cells and other cells of the adaptive immune
system. These professional migrators and searchers are a critical component of human immunity, and their
migration is targeted or hijacked by multiple pathogens including some pox and herpes viruses, tuberculosis,
and anthrax. Since dendritic cells can activate cytotoxic T cells to attack cancer cells, their migration also
plays a role in cancer immunotherapy strategies. Many cells, including dendritic cells, migrate by extending
lamellipodia. Lamellipodia are thin, planar protrusions that have been extensively studied for cells migrating
on 2D surfaces, such as glass coverslips. Dendritic cells use lamellipodia to find a path through crowded 3D
environments and to enter lymphatic vessels. Lamellipodia and the actin network that composes them have
been studied for decades. However, most molecularly detailed models of lamellipodia regulation and function
were derived from studying cells on 2D surfaces, so we still do not know how cells initiate and extend
lamellipodia in 3D environments. Dr. Driscoll will investigate how actin nucleators organize to generate sheet-
like lamellipodial morphologies in the absence of a surface to guide their generation, as well as how actin
nucleators organize to direct the extension of lamellipodia within crowded 3D environments. As a model of
dendritic cell migration through peripheral tissues, she will study their migration though 3D fibrous collagen
matrices.
Widely available microscopic techniques, such as confocal microscopy, cannot image cells in 3D collagen
with the spatial and temporal resolution required to measure the organization of actin nucleators in
lamellipodia. However, recently developed techniques, such as light-sheet microscopy, are just beginning to
be able to do so. Since light-sheet microscopes can easily produce 3D movies exceeding 1TB in size,
interpreting and even simply visualizing such large amounts of data requires sophisticated computing
workflows. Although Dr. Driscoll has recently developed computational tools to analyze light-sheet microscopy
images, to utilize these tools she needs further training in building and using light-sheet microscopes. The
Danuser and Fiolka labs at UT Southwestern are ideal locations to obtain this training. Dr. Gaudenz Danuser
is an expert at developing computer vision tools to address cell biology questions, whereas Dr. Reto Fiolka is
specialized in light-sheet microscopy of 3D systems. The training Dr. Driscoll receives will enable her to lead
an independent laboratory that focuses on how cells migrate through and interact with their 3D environment.
In summary, Dr. Driscoll will integrate light-sheet microscopy, 3D image analysis, and molecular biology
techniques to determine how lamellipodia form and function in 3D environments."

Recent advancements using immune checkpoint inhibitors designed to target tumor-mediated
immune tolerance have revolutionized cancer therapy. Unfortunately, these clinical successes
have not translated to glioblastoma (GBM), which continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy
with limited treatment options. One of the leading thoughts in the field explaining this lack of
clinical benefit in GBM is that these agents are acting upon the wrong target. Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) appear to represent the primary immune cells contributing towards the
immune suppressive microenvironment in GBM, vastly outnumbering T cell infiltration. Hence,
there is considerable interest in developing therapeutic strategies designed to target M2 TAMs or
revert their polarization to enhance antitumor immunity. We discovered the accumulation of
quinolinate (QA), a downstream intermediate of tryptophan metabolism, as a previously
undescribed metabolic node in GBM. Through a series of investigations, we went on to
demonstrate the potent ability of QA to sculpt the GBM immune landscape by polarizing
macrophages towards the immune suppressive M2 phenotype. Potent anti-tumor activity was
observed when tested in GBM lines grown intracranially, supporting the therapeutic potential of
targeting QA metabolism in GBM. In this proposal, we now seek to define mechanisms
contributing towards QA-mediated macrophage polarization (Aim 1), extend studies evaluating
the immunologic/metabolic consequence of targeting QA in GBM (Aim 2), and identify rational
combinatorial strategies designed to exploit inhibition of QA-induced immune suppression (Aim
3). If successful, these results would offer a previously unrecognized window into the complex
metabolic interplay between tumor and immune cells in the GBM microenvironment, its functional
consequence on immune suppression, and framework for the identification of novel therapeutic
strategies in this aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options."

 Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor with substantial genomic, molecular and phenotypic
heterogeneity, but uniformly dismal outcomes despite the current standard treatment of concurrent
temozolomide chemo-radiotherapy (CRT). Given the pace of disease recurrence and the challenges
associated with obtaining tumor tissue, there is an unmet clinical need for the real-time, noninvasive
assessment of GBM responsiveness to CRT. As demonstrated previously, most cancers shed tumor-derived
fragmented DNA into biofluids, including plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and these cell-free molecules
can be quantified as a measure of disease burden. The approach, named “liquid biopsy”, has recently
emerged as a breakthrough diagnostic and monitoring tool for diseases such as cancer, with the added benefit
of being minimally invasive. Through the sampling and analysis of biofluids, a number of promising glioma
biomarkers, derived from tumor-derived DNA in plasma (ctDNA) and CSF (CSF-tDNA) (together called rtDNA),
have been reported as diagnostic strategies for gliomas. Meanwhile, numerous previous studies have
demonstrated that protein-based amide proton transfer (APT) MRI can accurately identify tumor burden and
genetic markers (such as IDH, MGMT status) in gliomas. The goals of this proposal are to combine ctDNA and
CSF-tDNA with APT MRI to resolve the diagnostic challenges associated with discriminating treatment effect
from tumor progression and to develop an efficient and reliable deep-learning framework for post-treatment
monitoring. We propose the following specific aims to be performed: (1) correlate ctDNA and CSF-tDNA levels
with protein-based APT MRI characteristics when monitoring GBM treated with CRT; (2) determine the
accuracy of combined rtDNA/APT indices in identifying GBM recurrence; and (3) develop a transformer
pipeline using rtDNA and mpMRI to assess GBM prognosis. The success of this aim will help to understand
the dynamic patterns of rtDNA/APT throughout the treatment course for individuals with GBM. If our
rtDNA/APT investigation is successful, the results would dramatically improve the care of patients treated with
CRT and spare many patients from undergoing surgery for diagnostic purposes."
10914232,"Abstract. The rapid progress in genome sequencing has led to significant data collection. Analyzing
this data can be transformative in answering the key questions about disease associations and our
evolution. However, due to growing privacy concerns about the sensitive information of participants,
access to genomic datasets used in studies, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), is
restricted to only a limited number of large groups. On the other hand, collaborative research over
genomic datasets, which will also lead to democratizing genomic data sharing, requires sharing data
across collaborators. One way to share such datasets across collaborators is through the IRB process
and the use of institutional data use agreements. Currently, due to the sensitivity of data, the GWAS
computation can only be carried out after IRB review for all collaborators. In this research, we propose
a sandbox environment in which potential collaborators come together and obtain an accurate
""preview"" of their collaborative research in an efficient, reproducible (verifiable), and privacy-
preserving way. Our proposed framework allows each collaborator to share information about their
dataset in a privacy-preserving way within the proposed sandbox environment. This will help the
researchers (1) rectify their federated datasets from low-quality, biased, or statistically dependent
records, (2) generate an accurate preview of their collaborative GWAS results to provide evidence for
benefit versus risk tradeoff in IRB approval, and (3) identify what part of the datasets should be shared
among the collaborators (once they obtain the full IRB approval). To achieve these goals, we will
develop (1) novel algorithms that enable quality control over federated data while preserving
ownership and privacy and (2) algorithms that promote reproducibility of GWAS results by developing
novel techniques for verifying the correctness of GWAS computation and for sharing the whole
research datasets while preserving privacy. Our preliminary results show that the proposed framework
accurately provides evidence of reproducibility of GWAS results, identifies low-quality (e.g.,
statistically dependent) data in federated datasets, and preserves the privacy of individuals in
collaborators' datasets. Notably, we show that privacy risk due to the proposed framework is lower
than the one accepted by the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy. Finally, working together with the
IRB from three institutions, we will design a pilot study to explore the efficacy of the proposed
framework and its integration into the current IRB process. The outcomes of this research will provide
a new strategy for genomic data sharing."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Efforts to screen for agents that prevent and treat ischemic stroke, one of the leading causes of
death and permanent disability, have not produced promising results. Interestingly, light alcohol
consumption (LAC) lowers the incidence and improves the prognosis of ischemic stroke. Most
recently, we found that LAC promotes cerebral angiogenesis and neurogenesis under basal
conditions and following ischemic stroke. This renewal application will continue identifying the
cellular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effect of LAC. We aim to translate these
findings to humans having risk factors and suffering from the consequences of ischemic stroke.
In the previous grant period, we further found that LAC upregulates lipocalin-type prostaglandin
D2 synthase (L-PGDS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg), vascular
endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
(VEGFR2) in the brain. In preliminary studies, LAC-induced cerebral angiogenesis appeared to
be related to an increase in L-PGDS. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that
LAC promotes cerebral angiogenesis and neurogenesis by upregulating VEGF-A/VEGFR2 via
L-PGDS-mediated PPARg activation. In specific aim #1, we propose to test the hypothesis that
LAC promotes cerebral angiogenesis and neurogenesis via upregulated VEGF-A and VEGFR2.
In specific aim #2, we propose to test the hypothesis that LAC promotes cerebral angiogenesis
and neurogenesis via PPARg-mediated upregulation of VEGF-A and VEGFR2. In specific aim
#3, we propose to test the hypothesis that LAC upregulates VEGF-A and VEGFR2 and
promotes cerebral angiogenesis and neurogenesis via L-PGDS-mediated PPARg activation.
The findings from these studies will have far-reaching implications, beyond that for LAC. We
believe that by identifying the protective targets of LAC we will be able to apply therapy to
manipulate these targets in individuals at risk for ischemic stroke."
10738285,"Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is a highly sucessful treatment for eliminating seizures in patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). However, ATL-induced memory decline is frequent and often severe, having a
deleterious impact on quality of life and functional outcomes. Stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampectomy
(SLAH) has been introduced as a minimally-invasive alternative that could minimize risk of memory
decline. However, it is unclear which patients would benefit the most from SLAH and whether SLAH
decreases risk for critical aspects of episodic memory decline compared to ATL. During the previous grant
funding period, we demonstrated the clinical value of combining information from structural (sMRI), diffusion-
weighted (dMRI), and functional (fMRI) imaging to better characterize the neural networks that underlie
preoperative language and memory impairment and (re)organization and in TLE. We propose that the same
multimodal imaging (MMI) approach can be used to quantify risk for postoperative memory decline. In this R01,
we extend our MMI approach, combining sMRI/dMRI/fMRI with intracranial recordings (iEEG), enabling us to
delve deep into the spatial and temporal dynamics of episodic memory networks in TLE. We employ multimodal
associative learning tasks with real-world implications (i.e., pairing a face with a name) that have not before been
studied in the surgical context. In addition, we draw from cognitive neurosicence models of hippocampal
functioning that may inform why many patients struggle to make fine-grain distinctions in memory (i.e., impaired
pattern separation), even when simple item memory appears intact. We propose that our MMI approach will
yield a more complete characterization of episodic memory networks in TLE, reveal patterns of structural and
functional reorganization in individual patients, and enable a personalized approach to risk assessment when
considering surgical options. Finally, we will track cognitive and imaging changes post-ATL and SLAH and identify
patient-specific factors that promote reorganization and improved cognitive outcomes. The goals of this
renewal are perfectly aligned with the 2020 NINDS Benchmarks for Epilepsy Research (Part IV), which
stress the critical need for reseach to limit or prevent adverse consequences of seizures and their
treatments across the lifespan. Our renewal directly addresses this request, striving to improve surgical
decision-making, which will have an immediate and sustained impact on patient care. Epilepsy is a common
neurological disease that costs the healthcare system approximately $15.5 billion annually and can negatively
impact quality of life, employment, and health status. The current project has strong implications for public health
because it strives to improve health outcomes in patients with epilepsy by using advanced, noninvasive
technology to identify individual predictors of memory decline that can help to guide surgical decisions and
possibly reduce morbidity associated with removal or ablation of eloquent brain regions."

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has infected 76 million people worldwide and caused the death of 38
million. Current treatments can reduce patient viral loads but fail to cure patients of infection. This is due to the
ability of the virus to undergo latency during antiretroviral therapy. Latently infected cells are nearly
indistinguishable from uninfected cells and there is no effective treatment to eliminate these cells. Our long-
term goal is to describe at a single cell level, how early reservoir seeding occurs and the mechanisms that
drive latency establishment. The proposed experiments in this grant are based on the hypothesis that during
acute infection, a proportion of infected CD4+ T cells from diverse lineages of T cells such as resting CD4+
memory, activated T cells, naïve T cell, effector memory T cell undergo early latency and that transcriptional
pathways such as mTOR and EIF2 signaling and provirus integration into transcriptionally repressive site are
mechanisms of early latency establishment. This hypothesis is based on observations that: i) despite extremely
early ART treatment, HIV latent reservoir may be established earlier than 72 hours after exposure ii) a diverse
subset of T cells can harbor latent HIV iii) complex interactions between host and viral factors drive latency.
First generation latency marking technology has been developed by the Chen lab to report the history of HIV
infection through irreversible marking all HIV-infected cells called HIV-Induced Lineage Tracing (HILT). In this
application, I propose a second-generation, innovative genetic marking technology, Enhanced HILT (EHILT), to
further our knowledge the complexities of HIV latency. Using EHILT and validated small animal models of
latency, I will define early latency kinetics in in vitro and in vivo acute and ART-treated infection using EHILT,
identify transcriptional profiles and pathways associated with latency in vivo, and profile the integration sites of
provirus with immediate latent phenotype."

Our long-term objective is to develop highly translatable animal models for testing cancer
immunotherapies. Animal models have been essential in cancer research. However, mouse tumor
transplantation or tumor genetic models lack critical components for studying human anti-tumor
responses such as high mutational load, tumor microenvironment (TME) and tumor heterogeneity or
mice have major differences from humans in innate and adaptive immune responses. In response to
PAR-20-131, we will use our novel humanized mouse models (HuMice) to test gamma-delta T (γδT) cell-
based immunotherapies. Since Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells, a subtype of γδT cells that are most commonly used in
adoptive immunotherapy, are unique to primates, traditional mouse models are not ideal to study human
γδT cells. This proposal will maximize translational potential of mammalian models by studying
Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells-based therapy in HuMice with HLA-matched human melanomas from cell lines or
patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Our laboratories have established >500 melanoma PDX and >300
melanoma cell lines, which represent all clinical, genetic and biologic groups of the disease. In Aim 1, we
will study adoptive transfer of enhanced γδT cells. We will test a new Vγ9Vδ2+ T cell expansion method
in HuMice. We will then equip γδT cells with DR5-CAR that targets both myeloid derived suppressive
cells and melanoma cells. We will study alterations in the TME after treatment. To avoid potential toxicity
of targeting DR5, we will develop a novel combinatorial CAR that targets PD-L1 and DR5. In Aim 2, we
will stimulate endogenous γδT cells for cancer therapy. We will use bromohydrin pyrophosphate (BrHPP)
and resiquimod to expand endogenous human γδT cells to treat melanoma bearing HuMice. We will
study whether BTN3A1 mAbs expand human γδT cells and govern antitumor functions of both γδ and
CD8+ T cells in HuMice. We will then combine expansion of endogenous γδT cells with anti-PD-1 mAbs
in melanoma-bearing HuMice. We expect that HuMice will allow us to test expansion of endogenous
Vγ9Vδ2+ for cancer therapy for the first time in a model system and our new expansion methods are
effective and may be optimized and tested in future clinical trials."

HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are difficult to induce with vaccines, but are generated in
approximately half of HIV-1-infected individuals after years of chronic infection. Definition of the mechanisms
that enable bnAb development during infection will pave the way for vaccination strategies capable of eliciting
bnAbs. Some reasons bnAbs are not readily induced are their requirement for high immunoglobulin gene
somatic hypermutation that requires successive rounds of B cell affinity maturation in germinal centers and
their limitation by host regulatory controls. We have recently identified that HIV-1-infected individuals who
developed bnAbs have more dysfunctional natural killer (NK) cells as well as higher frequencies of circulating
CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells that provide critical help to B cells. We further demonstrated that activated
NK cells from HIV-seronegative donors could reduce Tfh cell numbers and decrease B cell activity in NK-Tfh-
B cell co-cultures. These data led to the scientific premise of our proposal that NK cell dysregulation results in
reduced NK cell constraints on Tfh availability which contributes to bnAb development during HIV-1 infection.
This identified NK cells as a potential key regulator of the HIV-1 bnAb response. The overall objective of this
proposal is to test our central hypothesis that transient blockade of NK cell immunoregulatory activity will
create an immunological environment permissive for the development of HIV-1 bnAbs by increasing germinal
center T and B cell responses. This hypothesis is supported by results from a preliminary study we have
performed in rhesus macaques to address the effects of transient NK depletion on the response to HIV
Envelope vaccination, where an increase in germinal center Tfh and B cell frequencies was observed in
macaques that had NK cells depleted during HIV vaccination compared with HIV vaccinated animals without
NK cell depletion. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) NK cells from HIV-1-infected
individuals generating bnAbs will have a more impaired immunoregulatory capacity than those from HIV-
infected individuals without bnAbs; (Aim 2) We will define the critical NK cell receptor-Tfh ligands important for
NK cell inhibition of Tfh and B cells; (Aim 3) Determine the mechanisms of transient NK cell depletion on the
germinal center HIV-1 neutralizing antibody response. This project is innovative because we have identified
that NK cell dysfunction contributes to HIV-1 bnAb development and have demonstrated in depletion of NK
cells improves germinal center activity after immunization. This contribution is significant because identifying
the molecular mechanisms and receptor-ligand interactions that mediate NK cell inhibition of Tfh and B cell
responses and determining the effect of NK cell depletion or receptor blockade on germinal center B cell a Tfh
cell repertoire and function in vivo will identify novel NK cell-targeting strategies that can be applied during
HIV-1 vaccination to improve immune responses."
10906985,"Imbalance of myocardial oxygen supply and consumption precipitates a cascade of physiological changes
resulting in ischemic pathology. While assessment of myocardial perfusion alone may allow accurate
assessment of myocardial oxygen consumption in some pathophysiological conditions, the perfusion-oxygen
consumption relationship is derailed in several conditions, including: myocardial ischemia and infarction,
hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, heart failure, valvular heart disease, and septic cardiomyopathy.
Importantly, this oxygen supply/perfusion mismatch occurs early – before mechanical dysfunction. Therefore,
evaluation of myocardial consumption independent of perfusion is of importance for early diagnosis and
monitoring of these pathophysiological conditions. Myocardial oxygen extraction fraction (mOEF), which relates
the biologic coupling of myocardial blood flow (oxygen supply) to oxygen consumption, may provide a more
accurate assessment of this balance. For example, in ischemic cardiomyopathy, adequate myocardial perfusion
is commonly reduced by high grade epicardial coronary artery stenoses. To avoid ischemia-caused injury, mOEF
is likely to be increased to compensate for decrease in myocardial perfusion and oxygen delivery to myocytes.
Consequently, the affected myocardial regions drop into a so called “hibernating” state that is effective in the
short term. In this respect, an accurate mOEF assessment is a unique tool, with the potential to determine the
likelihood of cardiac functional recovery after reperfusion. To date, the reference method for non-invasive
quantification of mOEF in vivo is Positron Emission Tomography (PET). We recently developed a novel contrast-
free cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) acquisition method to quantify mOEF in vivo that has several
advantages over PET: our CMR method has better spatial resolution, shorter acquisition time, does not expose
the patient to ionizing radiation, and could be more widely available than PET. The overall objective of this
study is to leverage our expertise in CMR imaging to refine and rigorously validate this new mOEF method. In
Aim 1. This technique will be developed with assistance of a novel deep learning approach for artifact-free
images and then validated using large animal models with and without induced coronary artery disease. Invasive
catheter-measured and non-invasive PET-MRI-measured mOEF will be used as reference. In Aim 2, the CMR
mOEF method will be validated in a small cohort of patients with hibernating myocardium in vivo, with the
availability of 18F-FDG-PET as reference. Although we will study this mOEF technique in hibernating myocardium,
this imaging method can be applied to the diagnosis and evaluation of treatments in a wide range of
cardiomyopathies. Given the capability of CMR for the comprehensive assessment of myocardial function, tissue
characterization, and viability, successful completion of CMR mOEF validation will provide a ‘one-stop shop’
evaluation of metabolic, functional, and structural abnormalities in patients with cardiomyopathy. Furthermore,
the advantage of fast imaging without using an intravenous contrast agent is well-suited for repeat quantitative
mOEF measurements needed to guide the effects of novel therapeutic interventional strategies."

Pathogenic Rickettsiae are obligate intracellular bacteria that cause diseases such as spotted fever and typhus.
We study the spotted fever group (SFG) species Rickettsia parkeri, which causes an eschar-associated human
rickettsiosis and is experimentally tractable, making it an ideal model for revealing molecular mechanisms of
SFG Rickettsia infection and virulence. Following invasion of host cells, SFG Rickettsia escape from the
phagosome into the cytosol, replicate while avoiding ubiquitylation and autophagy, and polymerize host actin to
promote intracellular motility and cell-cell spread. However, there are fundamental gaps in our knowledge of the
molecular mechanisms by which SFG Rickettsia exploit or disrupt host cell structures and pathways to promote
their infection cycle. Towards bridging these gaps, in the current granting period we discovered that the patatin-
like phospholipase enzyme Pat1 is important for virulence and for escaping from host membranes including
phagosomes and autophagosomes. We further showed that outer membrane protein OmpB and lysine
methylation are crucial for virulence and for shielding bacteria from ubiquitylation and autophagy. We also
observed that two actin-based motility proteins, RickA and Sca2, function independently in cell-cell spread and
virulence. Finally, we developed an interferon receptor-deficient mouse model of eschar-associated rickettsiosis
that can be used to evaluate the role of bacterial factors in virulence. These findings support the overall scientific
premise that rickettsial proteins manipulate host cell components to enable bacterial escape from host
membranes, avoidance of host ubiquitylation pathways, and mobilization of the host cytoskeleton for movement.
However, key outstanding questions remain. How does bacterial phospholipase activity contribute to infection?
How does bacterial surface architecture prevent ubiquitylation by host machinery? How and why do Rickettsia
use two mechanisms for intracellular movement? We will address these outstanding questions, testing the
overall hypothesis that the structure, function, and regulation of bacterial secreted and surface proteins is critical
for manipulating or avoiding host cell molecules and structures, enabling infection of cells and virulence in
animals. This general hypothesis will be tested in three Aims focused on uncovering the roles of Pat1, OmpB,
RickA, and Sca2 in escape from host membranes, intracellular survival, and motility. The Aims are to: (1)
determine how Rickettsia phospholipase activity contributes to infection; (2) reveal how Rickettsia surface
architecture enables avoidance of ubiquitylation; and (3) establish how and why Rickettsia use two mechanisms
for intracellular movement. The impact will be to reveal crucial molecular mechanisms used by Rickettsia and
other pathogens to manipulate host cells and the importance of these mechanisms to infectivity. Our studies
may also lead to improved diagnostics and treatments for rickettsial and other infections."

complications. However, AF is commonly asymptomatic and is frequently episodic, and therefore may be difficult
to diagnose. Although screening can detect undiagnosed AF, mass screening approaches have not resulted in
meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes. A major inefficiency inherent within current screening approaches
is the screening of many individuals at relatively low risk for AF, leading to an inefficient and low-yield screening
intervention. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need to identify individuals at elevated risk of developing AF
upfront, in order to optimize the efficiency of AF screening and preventive interventions. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we will develop and compare novel deep learning-based methods to estimate AF risk in an automated fashion
using mobile single-lead electrocardiograms. In Aim 2, we will conduct an individual-level simulation to quantify
the comparative and cost-effectiveness of a risk-based approach to AF screening, as compared to the current
clinical standard of AF screening based on the simple age cutoff of ³65 years. In Aim 3, we will perform a pilot
study to quantify the user acceptability of prospective AF risk estimation and quantify associations between
estimated AF risk and true AF incidence at 18 months. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish the
feasibility and potential clinical value of automated AF risk estimation to guide preventive interventions designed
to reduce the morbidity resulting from AF and its associated complications. The aims will be executed in the
setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide Dr. Khurshid, an early career
investigator, with the skills and experience required to become an independent clinician investigator focused on
the improvement of outcomes in cardiac arrhythmias through the use of disease risk prediction. This proposal
impanels a multi-disciplinary team comprising experts in machine learning, decision science, and prospective
clinical studies, who will guide Dr. Khurshid in his transition to scientific independence."

Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin early in life. Excessive caloric imbalance in
pregnancy is a leading suspected contributor to early weight disparities. Yet, prior studies have not accounted
for how limited food access may also drive chemical and psychosocial exposures that influence developmental
cardiovascular and metabolic programming to increase early childhood obesity risk. This Mentored Patient-
Oriented Research Career Development K23 proposal investigates how geospatial food access and
environmental oxidant stressors contribute to childhood obesity, a serious public health challenge and priority
of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Simultaneously, it will prepare the candidate, Carol
Duh-Leong, MD, MPP, to become an independent investigator who will address neighborhood disparities that
influence the social and chemical context of early child obesity. This study leverages longitudinal data from the
NYU Children’s Health and Environment Study, a participating birth cohort (50% Hispanic, 8% Asian, 7%
Black; 57% Public Insurance) in the NIH ECHO program that follows pregnant people prenatally and their
children postnatally through early childhood. The candidate proposes to geocode participant home addresses
and food environment data to longitudinally model joint relationships among geospatial food access,
environmental oxidant stressors, and early childhood obesity outcomes. Specific aims are: 1) Examine whether
limited geospatial food access increases phthalate and bisphenol exposures in pregnancy; 2) Examine
relationships between limited geospatial food access, psychosocial stressors, and oxidative stress in
pregnancy; and 3) Evaluate joint effects of geospatial food access and environmental oxidant stressors across
pregnancy and infancy on early childhood obesity outcomes. Closing this gap in knowledge would inform built
environment investments and neighborhood strategies to interrupt environmental oxidant stressors and
decrease obesity risk through the life course. Through the execution of these aims, the candidate will pursue
the following mentored training goals: 1) Advanced geospatial analysis; 2) Environmental exposure and
biomarker assessment; 3) Longitudinal analysis and environmental mixture modeling. This proposal draws
upon world-class clinical, research, and teaching resources available at NYU Grossman School of Medicine for
the candidate’s research and training aims. The candidate has assembled an expert mentorship team of
content experts in environmental epidemiology, geospatial analysis, exposure and biomarker assessment, and
advanced statistical methods to guide her research and training. This team will provide on-site training tailored
to the proposed research aims and will guide the candidate’s transition to independence and her establishment
of a research program that applies an interdisciplinary life course approach towards understanding the social
and environmental context of early child obesity."

The mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3A is essential for postnatal development of the brain,
control of body size and for the regulation of hematopoiesis. Mutations in the gene are commonly found in age-
associated clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminant potential and are drivers for certain leukemias making it
important that we understand how the enzyme functions in living cells. All human cancers contain DNA
methylation anomalies, however mutations in DNMT3A are relatively rare in solid tumors, suggesting that altered
enzyme regulation might be responsible for these changes. Although we know in exquisite detail how DNMT3A
methylates naked DNA, we know virtually nothing about how this occurs in the context of nucleosomes, the
fundamental building blocks of chromatin. The focus of this application is to address this issue using new insights
recently developed in the lab. We will concentrate on the role of a truncated isoform, DNMT3A2, normally
expressed during embryonic development but overexpressed in most solid cancers. Our novel cryo-EM structure
shows how this enzyme partners with an accessory protein DNMT3B3 to bind to nucleosomes through the acidic
patch – a totally unexpected discovery. We will follow up on this work using biochemical, cryo-EM, cellular and
mouse studies to gain a more precise understanding of how DNA methylation works in the context of chromatin.
A mouse model in which Dnmt3a2, but not the more widely studied longer isoform, Dnmt3a1, has been knocked
out will be used to test for causality in the process of immortalization and carcinogenesis in genetic and chemical
mouse models of cancer. This comprehensive approach will help in our understanding of how this fundamental
process works in normal and transformed cells.
Studies on how DNA methylation marks are interpreted in cells has long been confined to comparison between
fully and completely unmethylated CpG dyad states. Because of the flexibility in the R35 funding mechanism,
we serendipitously discovered that CpG hemimethylation can either stimulate or inhibit binding by CTCF
depending on which duplex strand is methylated. We will investigate the prevalence of hemimethylation in cancer
cells and investigate its effects on binding of other transcription factors and chromatin structure. Differential
binding may play a role in asymmetric cell divisions in cancer cells. We hope to answer three critical questions:
1) Does DNMT3A2 overexpression contribute to carcinogenesis? 2) How does de novo methylation occur in a
nucleosomal context? 3) What are the potential biological roles for hemimethylation?"

Our central premise is that HIV transcriptional inhibitors can be used as latency promoting agents (LPAs) in
block-and-lock functional cure approaches, aimed at reducing residual viremia during antiretroviral therapy (ART)
and limiting viral rebound upon treatment interruption (TI). This hypothesis came about with the discovery of the
Tat inhibitor, didehydro-Cortistatin A (dCA). In in vitro and in vivo models of HIV latency combining ART with
dCA accelerated HIV-1 suppression to below the limit of detection and blocked viral rebound upon TI or
stimulation with latency reversing agents (LRAs). The transcriptional shutdown by dCA resulted in the
heterochromatinization and loss of RNAPII at the HIV promoter. We recently reported on another LPA, the
generic drug Spironolactone (SP). Interestingly this drug degrades the host XPB subunit of the general
transcription factor TFIIH inhibiting HIV transcription in primary cells from infected individuals and blocking viral
reactivation from latency without affecting cellular transcriptomics7. This study is important because it highlights
that a host factor can be targeted to silence HIV without affecting cellular viability. In sum, the more knowledge
we gain on the interconnectivity between Tat, transcription factors regulatory mechanisms and how these affect
nucleosomes positioning around the HIV promoter, the more we can leverage transcriptional regulators as
antiviral targets.
 To identify novel host factors regulating HIV transcription we used a chromatin affinity purification approach
together with mass spectrometry (ChAP-MS). We identified p32 (ASF/SF2 splicing factor-associated protein)
and FUBP3 (Far upstream element binding protein 3) in productively infected ART treated promoters but not in
dCA-treated where HIV was silenced; and PHB2 (prohibitin-2) was enriched in dCA treated promoters but
reduced in ART only treated ones. These results suggest that p32 and FUBP3 are HIV transcriptional
activators while PHB2 is a HIV silencing factor. Preliminary studies confirmed their transcriptional activity on
HIV. Here we propose a detailed molecular mechanistic study on how p32 and FUBP3 enhance and how PHB2
inhibits HIV transcription. Understanding their role in pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation, initiation, elongation
and nucleosome organization at the latent HIV promoter will be key for developing successful strategies for
durable HIV silencing. Strong effects of one or more of these factors will prompt the search for small-molecule
modulators. Our overarching goal is to durably silence latent HIV proviruses by driving each into stable
heterochromatin where they will remain “locked.” We propose the following aims:
Aim 1: Define the roles of p32, FUBP3 and PHB2 in HIV transcription and chromatin structure.
Aim 2: Identify protein complexes associated with p32, FUBP3 and PHB2 and study interaction with Tat.
Aim 3: Investigate the “block-and-lock” approach using single or combinations of factors and their dependence
on Tat/TAR circuitry."
10733422,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced carcinomas are among the most lethal human diseases, being metastatic prostate cancer (PC) a
classic example. Despite current treatments, metastatic PC progresses to a therapy resistant stage that
precedes lethality. Therefore, there is a need to identify new targetable mechanisms driving cancer
aggressiveness to continue improving patients’ outcome. The main objective of this research proposal is to
dissect the mechanisms by which Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) regulate genome functions (gene expression
and integrity) in PC and uncover novel NPC-regulated targetable pathways using innovative pre-clinical models
of lethal PC. NPCs contribute to different biological functions through their building blocks nucleoporins (Nups),
including nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, chromatin organization, gene expression, genome integrity and mitotic
regulation. In the context of cancer, Nups have been associated to tumor formation and development, however
their specific mechanistic role in cancer pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Recently we identified clinically
relevant Nups upregulated in lethal PC through interrogation of publicly available patient tissue sample
transcriptomic datasets containing primary and castration-chemotherapy-resistant metastatic prostate tumors.
Within the upregulated Nups, POM121 was shown to play a role in the aggressiveness of lethal PC (cell survival,
proliferation and tumorigenesis) via nuclear transport regulation. Yet, the specific transport-dependent and -
independent mechanisms by which POM121 regulates the aggressive features of PC and its crosstalk with other
Nups remain unknown. Notably, functional genomic studies (transcriptomic and computational analysis)
combined with biochemical and single-cell high-resolution imaging have revealed a crosstalk between two top
upregulated Nups in lethal PC, POM121 and TPR, which impacts on the aggressiveness properties of PC cells.
Specifically, we found that PC cell survival is enhanced by the POM121 transcriptional regulation of specific
genome stability genes and TPR, which in turn regulates mitotic checkpoint activity, through Androgen Receptor
(AR)-dependent and independent mechanisms. Crucially, our studies have also uncovered a potential novel role
of soluble chromatin-bound Nups in the regulation of aggressive features of PC cells potentially through direct
transcriptional regulation. Thus, collectively these results led to the hypothesis that NPCs regulate PC
aggressiveness through multifaceted mechanisms controlling both genome functions and stability. We will
address this hypothesis and determine the Nup-specific mechanisms contributing to PC aggressiveness through
three aims. In Aim 1, we will define POM121 nuclear transport-dependent and -independent mechanisms
promoting PC aggressiveness. In Aim 2, we will examine the POM121-TPR mechanistic interplay enhancing
genome stability and cell survival in lethal PC. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the clinical significance and efficacy of
targeting specific NPC-regulated pathways controlling genome integrity in patient derived pre-clinical models."

 Prostate cancer depends on androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) for growth and progression.
Metastatic tumors are usually initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy by way of medical or surgical
castration; however, tumors eventually recur as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which progresses due
to the intratumoral generation of testosterone and/or dihydrotestosterone and AR stimulation. The identification
of these mechanisms and the requirement for sustained AR stimulation has led to the development of
enzalutamide, which is a next-generation hormonal therapy that directly and potently antagonizes AR and thereby
extends survival for men with metastatic CRPC. Unfortunately, responses to enzalutamide are temporary and
resistance eventually leads to death. Enzalutamide resistance is therefore a major and widespread clinical problem
for patients with advanced prostate cancer.
 Recent evidence suggests that enzalutamide resistance is driven by an up-regulation of the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR), which re-establishes the expression of 50% of genes that are usually responsive to AR stimulation.
Unfortunately, the clinical application of this finding is challenged by the fact that complete and systemic GR
ablation is lethal in humans. However, identification of a tumor tissue-specific mechanism that enables GR
stimulation might provide a potential therapeutic target that would not compromise the patient.
 We hypothesize that GR stimulation that occurs with AR antagonist resistance is accompanied by a
tumor-specific metabolic mechanism that furnishes abundant local concentrations of cortisol, a GR agonist. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11βHSD2), the enzyme that is primarily
responsible for cortisol inactivation, is lost with AR antagonist resistance, resulting in augmented local cortisol
concentrations. Furthermore, we hypothesize that blocking this metabolic mechanism would reverse GR
stimulation and thereby reinstate responsiveness to AR antagonist therapy. Our preliminary data suggest that
replacing 11βHSD2 enzymatic function, by either restoring 11βHSD2 expression or blocking the machinery that
is required for 11βHSD2 protein degradation, reverses the metabolic phenotype and restores sensitivity to AR
antagonist therapy. In Aim 1, we will determine the metabolic phenotype conferred by treatment with next-
generation hormonal therapies for CRPC. In Aim 2, we will identify the molecular mechanisms that regulate
glucocorticoid metabolism in AR antagonist resistance. In Aim 3, we will determine the therapeutic significance
of restoring the baseline metabolic phenotype in AR antagonist resistance. Together, these studies will identify
and clinically validate mechanisms that drive AR antagonist resistance. It is anticipated that this work will lead
to the identification of tumor-specific mechanisms of resistance to next-generation hormonal therapies that are
pharmacologically targetable and to the eventual development of new treatment strategies for the lethal form of
prostate cancer."

exist with a plethora of Gram-negative resistance determinants including Extended Spectrum β-lactamases

polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant E. coli producing New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-5)
together with mobile colistin resistance (MCR-1) in a patient. The recent report of pan-drug-resistant (PDR),
K. pneumoniae (NDM-1, ESBLs, and polymyxin resistance determinants), from a patient in Nevada further
highlights that it may be only a matter of time until hospitals in the US and worldwide face an outbreak of
these Gram-negative ‘superbugs’. It is critical to prepare therapeutics for the future occurrence of NDM
strains which harbor a diverse array of resistance determinants. Our Central Hypothesis is that rationally
optimized antibiotic combination dosing strategies will achieve extensive killing and prevent emergence of
resistance against of NDM-producing Enterobactericeae. Our preliminary studies provide compelling
evidence in support of our innovative combinations. We established the first highly efficient cassette assay
to assess target site penetration of β-lactams in the presence of polymyxins, the first dataset on β-lactam
receptor binding in K. pneumoniae, and show that new 4-drug combination regimens eradicated NDM and
ESBL co-producing K. pneumoniae and prevented resistance. In Aim 1, we will create genetically
engineered strains, as well as assess the target site penetration and receptor binding of β-lactam antibiotics
and β-lactamase inhibitors, and the enhanced penetration in presence of polymyxins. In Aim 2, in vitro
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models, including the dynamic Hollow Fiber Infection Model, will
evaluate optimized dosing strategies for 3- and 4-drug combinations by profiling the time course of bacterial
killing, suppression of resistance, and persister eradication. Genomics and transcriptomics will be utilized to
understand why monotherapies and non-optimized combinations failed with resistance. In Aim 3, our latest
Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modelling approach will guide translation across all
experimental tiers. Prospective validation of these novel optimal combination dosing strategies will be
completed in murine pneumonia models with an intact and impaired immune system. This will yield
innovative combination dosage regimens against pandrug-resistant CRE that can suppress resistance.
Thus, this project will address an urgent, global medical need. This project will provide the first
mechanistically informed, rationally optimized and prospectively validated combination dosing strategies of
available antibiotics against resistant Gram-negatives that will be ready for testing in future clinical trials."

The goal of this project is to develop a novel bifocal catadioptric objective that will allow large-scale recording of
neural circuits in vivo. The objective will enable faster volumetric imaging of large brain regions by simultaneous
two-photon (2P) imaging of shallow layers and three-photon (3P) imaging of deep layers of brain tissues with
improved collection efficiency. Although three-photon microscopy (3PM) allows imaging at depths inaccessible
by two photon microscopy (2PM), 2P excitation generates larger fluorescence signal with lower excitation pulse
energy when imaging at shallow tissue layers. Therefore, for fast imaging across a large depth, the optimum
approach is to use 2PM for the superficial layers and 3PM for the deeper regions simultaneously. Implementation
of this approach inevitably requires the objective lens to generate two focal planes that are separated by a large
axial distance while still maintaining high spatial resolution and large field of view. Simultaneous 2PM and 3PM
will not only allow for utilization of the advantages of both modalities but also for faster volumetric imaging of
large brain columns. We will develop a bifocal catadioptric (i.e., both refractive and reflective) lens based on the
idea of separation the optical paths of the excitation light with different wavelengths. The lens will feature two
focal planes separated axially by ~ 600 µm for the 2P (< 1100 nm) and 3P (>1200 nm) excitation wavelengths.
The design approach also separates the excitation path and the collection path and allows independent
optimization for efficient collection of the emitted fluorescence. The bifocal objective will collect fluorescence
back through non-imaging pathways, which enables the proposed catadioptric objective to have a large collection
numerical aperture and a large collection field of view. The collection efficiency is approximately 5x higher than
the commercially available objective lenses when imaging deep (>1 mm) into the mouse brain. Improving the
signal collection efficiency will immediately increase the frame rate without increasing the excitation power,
enabling high-resolution, high-speed imaging at these depths. We will design, fabricate and validate the novel
objective lens and will combine it with focus-tunable lenses to enable faster volumetric imaging of mouse brains.
The successful completion of this program will immediately enable simultaneous 2P and 3P imaging across a
large range of depth (~ 1.2 mm), such as recording population of neurons across different layers of mouse brains.
The technology developed within this program will have potential impacts in a large number of biomedical fields
such as neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology."

highly comorbid with IDs. The richness of this data allows for an in-depth analysis of disease
mechanisms. We will build multivariate models that include the phenotypic, environmental, familial, and
molecular genetic levels to understand which of the mechanisms are shared amongst versus specific to
the 5 IDs and 3 associated FDs. To meet these goals, we propose three specific aims. In our first aim, we
will investigate, utilizing a range of causal inference and multivariate methods, the etiologic relations
between IDs and between IDs and FDs, leveraging the rich longitudinal and family structure of Lifelines.
Our second aim will be to use advanced genetic epidemiologic and molecular genetic methods applied

interaction of genetic and environmental risk factors on the development(s) of IDs and FDs. This will
include examining the effects of genetic nurture. We will again be using complimentary methods to

10857196,"Title: Targeting the Plk1/Pdcd4/mTORC2 signaling to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer
Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is essential for development of prostate cancer (PCa), including castration-
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Consequently, androgen signaling inhibitors (ASIs), such as abiraterone and
enzalutamide, are becoming the first line treatment for CRPC. However, the limited success of ASIs makes it
urgent to develop approaches to treat CRPC patients who are no longer responsive to ASIs. Programmed cell
death 4 (Pdcd4) is a tumor suppressor, which has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor progression and
chemoresistance. Furthermore, Pdcd4 is an androgen-repressed protein that regulates PCa growth and
castration resistance. As such, it will be of clinical significance to understand the regulation mechanism of Pdcd4,
as it will reveal novel approaches to overcome ASI resistance. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a critical regulator of
cell cycle-related events, is a documented target for PCa treatment. Of note, we previously demonstrated that
inhibition of Plk1 enhances the efficacy of ASIs. The long-term goals of this study are to identify druggable
signaling pathways that offer effective treatment options for patients with CPRC who are no longer responsive
to ASIs. The objective is to define the role of Plk1 in regulating Pdcd4 and to exploit these pathways as a novel
therapeutic target for CRPC. Our data show that 1) Pdcd4 enhances the sensitivity to enzalutamide due to
inhibition of mTORC2 (the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) and AR expression; 2) Plk1
phosphorylation of Pdcd4 results in its protein degradation; and 3) the dominant negative Pdcd4 peptide (TAT-
RBD) overcomes ASI resistance in PCa. Based on these observations, we aim to test the central hypothesis that
Plk1-associated phosphorylation of Pdcd4 results its degradation, which causes subsequent activation of the
mTORC2, eventually contributing to activation of AR signaling and ASI resistance. Our hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three Specific Aims - (1) to demonstrate that loss of Pdcd4 to activate mTORC2 contributes to ASI
resistance; (2) to dissect how Plk1 phosphorylation of Pdcd4 regulates its function as a tumor suppressor; and
(3) to analyze clinical significance of Plk1 phosphorylation of Pdcd4. These complementary aims will be
accomplished using biochemical analyses of signaling intermediates and employing genetic strategies with
culture systems, inducible PCa mouse models, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and human PCa samples. The
rationale for the research is that it will probe the importance of Plk1-associated activity to Pdcd4 and to examine
whether TAT-RBD peptide is a novel approach to treat ASI-resistant CRPC. This contribution is significant
because, if positive, the results of the proposed study will support an immediate clinical trial for TAT-RBD peptide
to treat CRPC that not respond to ASIs. The multiple-PI team, consisted of complementary expertise on Plk1 (X.
Liu) and Pdcd4 (Yang), as well as prostate cancer pathology (Allison) and biostatistics (Chen), will be able to
finish the proposed research in a timely manner."

This project will use PET imaging and machine learning to relate Mu and Kappa receptor levels in Alcohol Use
Disorder (AUD) to clinical outcomes during a quit attempt.
Over 14 million adults in the US suffer from AUD and there are few effective pharmacotherapies. Rates of
lapse and relapse are remarkably high and this remains the biggest hurdle to successful recovery.
Development of new treatments must be based on an understanding of the relationship between neurobiology
and behaviors involved in recovery from AUD. Existing evidence suggests that the opioid system, through a
balance between euphoria (Mu-Opioid Receptors; MOR) and dysphoria (Kappa-Opioid Receptors; KOR),
regulates key clinical outcomes (e.g., alcohol craving, anhedonia, and withdrawal) which play critical roles in
alcohol lapse/relapse behaviors in AUD. The balance between these OR receptors in healthy animals is
disrupted by the consumption of alcohol and the progression of addiction. There is limited data in humans to
characterize this disruption. Developing an understanding of the imbalance between MOR and KOR in
individuals with AUD, and the associations of this imbalance with craving, mood, withdrawal, and time to lapse
(first drink) during a quit attempt, will facilitate the development of tailored therapies to target the imbalance
and improve clinical outcomes.
PET studies of people with AUD have examined MOR and KOR availability, separately. Previous studies
measured MOR in ventral striatum (VS) with an MOR-selective tracer and found higher MOR in VS of people
with AUD compared to healthy subjects (HS). We used a KOR-selective PET tracer and observed that people
with AUD had significantly lower KOR availability in amygdala and pallidum vs. HS. KOR availability in key
regions (e.g., whole striatum) also predicted a reduction in drinking in participants treated with the opioid
antagonist naltrexone. It seems that upregulation of MOR and downregulation of KOR occur in the course of
AUD and that both are related to clinical outcomes. No one has ever imaged both targets in the same people.
We will use PET to image both MOR and KOR availability in HS and AUD. We will quantify the relationships
between MOR and KOR of AUD patients, separately and jointly, to key clinical outcomes during their
subsequent quit attempt. We will use linear models to relate regional values of binding of each tracer to clinical
outcomes. We will also use advanced clustering techniques to identify distinct groups of participants according
to their imaging data. Our goal is to understand the interactions of the two major opioid receptor systems and
how they encode the behaviors of AUD sufferers during a quit attempt. The results could guide development of
new targeted therapies. Machine learning (Spectral Clustering) will also help us identify features in the images
that may be useful in the future for prediction of clinical outcomes."
10878881,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by nutrients and
energy, phosphorylating substrates to promote and coordinate anabolic metabolism. mTOR was identified
about thirty years ago in a yeast screen for mutants resistant to growth inhibition by the drug rapamycin; shortly
thereafter the highly conserved mammalian ortholog was discovered independently by biochemical methods.
Over the past thirty years, biochemical and genetic approaches have identified numerous evolutionarily
conserved components of the mTOR signaling pathway as well as the proteins forming the two distinct mTOR
complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is composed of three core components, mTOR, Raptor, and
mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8); Rictor replaces Raptor in mTORC2. mTORC1 is inhibited by
rapamycin whereas mTORC2 is relatively insensitive. mTORC1 has been intensely studied because it
functions as a central regulator of the cell’s response to nutrients and energy and thereby impacts clinically
important conditions such as cancer, aging, and hypoxic injury. Through an unbiased mutant screen in C.
elegans for hypoxia resistant mutants, we have identified a missense partial-loss-of-function mutation in daf-
15, which encodes the sole C. elegans ortholog of Raptor (Ce-Raptor). A CRISPR/CAS9-generated mutant
with the identical lesion confirmed the mutation as conferring hypoxia resistance. Our discovery that reduction
of function of Ce-Raptor imparts resistance to hypoxic injury is consistent with published data using mTORC1
inhibitors in mammalian models. Our Ce-Raptor mutant called daf-15(gc67) is unique among published
metazoan Raptor mutants in that it is conditional; Raptor pathway functions can be turned off and on again by
simply varying temperature. daf-15(gc67) is essentially wild type at the standard culture temperature of 20°C,
hypoxia resistant at 22°C, and developmentally arrested at 25°C, the phenotype of daf-15 null mutants. The
graded temperature-conditional nature of the daf-15(gc67) phenotypes overcomes a critical barrier in the field
by providing a genetic reagent that allows temporal and tunable genetic control of Raptor and mTORC1
function for the first time in metazoans. This project will use this unique reagent to answer key questions about
how and when Raptor regulates hypoxic injury. In Aim 1, we will combine genetic and proteomic methods to
test specific hypotheses and discover the Raptor-regulated proteins that determine how and when Raptor
controls hypoxic injury. Using our conditional mutant, we have completed a screen for suppressors of Raptor
loss of function. In Aim 2, we will identify mutated genes suppressing Raptor loss-of-function and thereby
discover regulators of Raptor-mediated hypoxic sensitivity. Through these two aims, we will define how Raptor
regulates hypoxic sensitivity. Given the unbiased nature of the suppressor screen and proteomic studies, our
project has potential to identify novel components of the mTORC1 pathway and thereby more broadly advance
our fundamental understanding of mTORC1 signaling pathways, including those regulating cancer and aging."

Learning and memory are modulated by dopaminergic circuits, which convey valence and/or arousal signals.
This proposal will examine how discrete dopaminergic circuits modulate learning and memory and neuronal
plasticity in memory-encoding brain regions in Drosophila. Specifically, it will disentangle the roles of
dopaminergic circuits that convey positive valence signals, negative valence signals, and valence-independent
arousal signals. In vivo imaging experiments will examine how these dopaminergic neurons drive discrete
patterns of plasticity in the mushroom body and downstream valence-coding output neurons that mediate
approach and avoidance behavior. Complementary behavioral and optogenetic manipulation experiments will
decipher how each of these neuronal subsets modulates arousal, valence, and memory strength. These
studies will apply the large genetic toolkit and experimental throughput of the fly toward developing a more
comprehensive understanding of how learning and memory alter the flow of information through the brain, to
ultimately engage novel behaviors (e.g., conditioned approach/avoidance) following learning.
Understanding how memories are encoded in the brain and disrupted in brain disorders is a prerequisite to the
rational design of treatments for memory impairment. Results of the present studies will provide guideposts for
future research into the molecular biology of memory formation across multiple model organisms, as
dopaminergic circuits regulate arousal and memory across taxa. The project will support our long-term goal of
understanding of memory down to the single-cell and subcellular levels, contributing to the knowledge base
necessary for the rational development of novel treatments for memory impairment."

Epidemiological and experimental data have shown that chronic exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM)
leads to exacerbation of atherosclerosis, and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We have shown
that mouse exposures to diesel exhaust and ultrafine particles (PM< 0.18 µm) lead to increased lipid peroxidation
in the lungs and systemic tissues, accompanied by effects on plasma lipoproteins, disturbances in lipid
metabolism, liver steatosis, and atherosclerosis, all components of the so-called cardiometabolic syndrome. PM-
induction of these disorders is thought to involve chronic and persistent activation of inflammatory pathways.
However, while chronic exposure to PM < 2.5 µm (PM2.5) has been reported to result in steatohepatitis, we have
shown that chronic exposure to diesel exhaust also leads to triglyceride accumulation in the liver (steatosis) but
without the inflammatory component, suggesting that PM with different compositions could have different abilities
to activate inflammatory pathways after chronic exposures. This project has been designed to dissect molecular
pathways involved in the development and progression versus inhibition or resolution of inflammation. Our
central hypothesis is that PM exposure promotes cardiometabolic toxicity via prooxidant and proinflammatory
effects that lead to wide dysregulation of arachidonic acid metabolic pathways, with activation of 5-lipoxygenase,
overpowering the counteracting actions of homeostatic protective responses when that activation is persistent.
We will test this hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) Determine molecular pathways involved in the inhibition
of steatohepatitis after exposure to diesel exhaust. 2) Dissect molecular pathways and toxic constituents
involved in the development and progression of steatohepatitis and atherosclerosis after exposure to ultrafine
particles. 3) Determine whether PM-induced chronic inflammation is mediated by the persistent activation of the
5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway, and explore the therapeutic potential of blocking this pathway to mitigate the
cardiometabolic toxicity and resolve inflammation induced by PM. In aims 1 and 2, LDL-R KO mice will be
exposed to whole diesel exhaust or ultrafine concentrated ambient particles, respectively, to evaluate the effect
of different PMs on the development of fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis in experimental protocols of
continuous or intermittent exposures to PM. Intervening molecular pathways will be analyzed in various tissues
(lungs, blood, liver, aorta), especially those involving arachidonic acid metabolism and antioxidant homeostatic
responses. Data will be integrated with inflammatory endpoints obtained in various tissues, alveolar and systemic
macrophages. Comparison among contrasting effects observed in both aims will enable identification of critical
pathways responsible for development versus resolution of chronic inflammation. In aim 3, LDL-R KO mice
deficient in 5-LO or treated with pharmacological inhibitors of the 5-LO pathway will be tested to evaluate the
role of 5-LO activation in mediating PM-induced inflammation. This project will help in better understanding of
PM-induced toxicity with prophylactic or therapeutic implications."

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked 1000s of genomic loci with human traits and diseases.
However, the mechanistic inner workings of these loci are largely unknown, leaving the principal goal of GWAS
– illuminating the causal biological etiology of heritable phenotypes – unfulfilled. Most GWAS loci occur within
noncoding regions of the genome whose functional impact on gene regulation is difficult to unravel. Here, we
propose to develop a high-throughput, integrated genome engineering toolbox to build context-specific maps of
enhancers and variants for immune traits and autoimmune disorders. Our multi-PI team consists of experts in
complementary fields: molecular genomics and CRISPR screens, large-scale human genetics and functional
genomics data analysis, immunology, statistical modeling, and single-cell multiomics. Specifically, we propose
to: 1) Identify genes and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) relevant for T cell function. T cells are a central cell
type implicated in multiple autoimmune diseases. We will first perform genome-wide loss- and gain-of-function
screens for 9 phenotypes reflecting T-cell differentiation and activation using primary human T cells. For top-
ranked genes, we will interrogate CREs near each gene and explore their mechanisms via single-cell profiling
and saturation mutagenesis. 2) Build a context-specific enhancer map of GWAS loci in T cells. We will test 1,000
candidate CREs that overlap GWAS loci using CRISPRi/a screens in the same primary T-cell system,
complemented by single-cell ECCITE-seq to measure effects on the transcriptome and surface proteome. This
will produce a comprehensive map of regulatory elements for a large number of loci, and their context-specific
impact on transcriptomic and cellular phenotypes. Then, we will construct a context-specific variant map of
regulatory elements in T cells by inserting specific alleles via base editing at 100 validated CREs. This will
produce a fine-resolution map of regulatory sites within CREs. 3) Test 100 syntenic CREs from in mouse models
of gut homeostasis and inflammation in vivo. We will focus on T-cell tissue accumulation (reflecting activation
and migration) and alterations in transcriptional and cell surface phenotypes of the migrating cells. By doing so,
we will determine if the relevant variants have similar roles in human disease and provide pathways towards
targeting the pathogenic functions of those genes. Through these Aims, we will build a highly-generalizable
toolkit for multi-scale interrogation of noncoding elements and an accessible, open, and reusable resource of
enhancer and variant effects on molecular, cellular, and physiological traits. Altogether, we will analyze the
regulatory architecture of the genome, leveraging our diverse perturbations and phenotypic layers, and
characterize functional mechanisms of loci associated with autoimmune disorders."
10915619,"Project Summary
 Lens, an avascular organ, relies heavily on a network of transporting systems to deliver nutrients and other
essential components to bulky lens fibers and excrete wastes. Differentiated nuclear fiber cells never turn over,
and oxidative stress is a major cause of age-related cataracts. Fluid flow associated with lens microcirculation
is thought to help deliver nutrients, antioxidants, and small molecules to inner lens fibers. Connexin (Cx)-
forming gap junction channels (GJs) play an essential role in the metabolic homeostasis of the lens. Besides
GJs, connexins form hemichannels (HCs), permitting the transport of molecules between the cell and its
extracellular environment. Our preliminary studies indicate that lens epithelial HCs are activated by FSS and
release GSH and ATP; these released factors protect lens fiber cells against oxidative stress and promote lens
fiber differentiation, respectively. As such, we hypothesize that (1) The epithelial HCs formed by Cx43 and/or
Cx50 activated by FSS regulate GSH de novo synthesis, release, and redox hemostasis; (2) GSH released by
epithelial HCs is taken up by HCs in cortical fiber cells and transferred to nuclear fiber cells to maintain lens
fiber cell redox homeostasis and viability; (3) Epithelial HCs activated by FSS generate secretomes and
released ATP, and its binding to purinergic P2X receptors (P2XRs) (i.e., P2XR3 or/and P2XR7) regulate Ca2+
signaling and fiber cell differentiation. The goal is to elucidate the roles of lens epithelial HCs activated under a
physiological level of mechanical stimulation in hemostasis, differentiation, and protection against oxidative
insults in lens fiber cells. In this proposal, first, we will determine if Cx HCs activated by FSS serve as a major
pathway in regulating GSH synthesis, export, and redox homeostasis in lens epithelial cells. Second, we will
test if GSH released by lens epithelial HCs is taken up by mechano-activated HCs in cortical lens fibers and
transferred to nuclear fibers via GJs functions in reducing ROS and protecting fiber cells against oxidative
stress. Third, we will determine if ATP released by lens epithelial HCs and activation of purinergic receptor
signaling regulates fiber cell differentiation and globally investigate secretomes by FSS-activated epithelial
HCs. One of the major innovative aspects is that this proposal aims to uncover novel, integrated roles of Cx
HCs in lens epithelial and fiber cells and GJs in antioxidant transport, fiber cell protection, and the role of ATP
released by epithelial HCs and activated P2XRs in lens fiber differentiation. We will use chick primary lens
cultures, chick lens in situ, ex vivo mouse lens explants of wild-type and knockout mice, HC-specific inhibiting
antibodies, dominant mutants, and mechanical loading models. It is our expectation that elucidation of the
mechanistic roles of Cx channels in lens cells will provide a better understanding of the key homeostatic
process of the lens. The outcomes of our research will be significant because the discoveries should make
novel and beneficial contributions to new therapeutic strategies and identify drug targets for the treatment of
lens disorders, such as age-related cataracts."

With increased incidence in young populations and ~65% three-year survival of high-risk locally advanced rec-
tal cancer, innovative approaches to improve outcomes is imperative. Neoadjuvant therapy with radiation (RT)
and chemotherapy (CT) is now the standard curative treatment, but there is demand for non-operative man-
agement (NOM) if the disease can be cured with local and systemic therapy. Thus, innovations could be trans-
formative with the aim to improve durable complete responses by personalizing therapy, which includes how to
deliver RT, CT, and the incorporation of novel agents such as immunotherapy. Cancer Immunotherapy has
had little impact on colorectal cancer outside of mismatch repair deficient tumors. The αCD40 agonist antibody
is an emerging class of immunotherapy and sotigalimab has shown promise in phase I and multiple ongoing
phase II trials. The CD40 receptor is important in both innate and adaptive immune responses and a greater
therapeutic effect can be achieved combining αCD40 with RT in animal models. We hypothesize that short
course RT (SCRT) and CT when combined with αCD40 in human tumors can result in a greater antitumor im-
mune response, reduce risk of metastatic progression, and extend survival in a poorly immunogenic malig-
nancy like rectal cancer. We developed the INNATE trial, a phase II randomized trial of neoadjuvant SCRT fol-
lowed by CT with or without the addition of sotigalimab for locally advanced rectal cancer. This trial design has
allowed us to collect fresh pre- and post-SCRT biopsy tissue, which we have obtained from 21 of 30 patients
enrolled to date. In this proposal, we focus on the central hypothesis that an integrated molecular, cellular, and
spatial assessment of treatment response dynamics in the tumor microenvironment early after SCRT can re-
veal insights into the immunobiological responses, which can inform mechanisms of efficacy and therapeutic
selection. We will perform 1) molecular and cellular single cell (sc) RNAseq with proteomic and immune reper-
toire analysis, 2) molecular, cellular, and spatial multiplex immunofluorescence, and 3) cellular and spatial
quantitative deep learning based histopathologic analysis to achieve our aims. These three technologies will
enable us to investigate early changes across RT and αCD40 treated groups. Then we will aim to identify ther-
apeutic opportunities for the combination of SCRT with immune active agents though an integrated RT re-
sponse assessment. Lastly, we will establish innate and adaptive immunologic signaling events triggered by
SCRT in combination with αCD40 immunotherapy and factors that enhance or hinder efficacy. We will use
models to start validating key findings and aim to propose future therapeutic directions to build off these efforts
and ultimately improve outcomes. Specifically, regarding our patient population, we expect this proposal will
lead to evidenced based trials for most patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who strive to achieve cure
without a morbid surgery."
10738725,"Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an increased risk of developing
ischemic stroke. Veterans enduring PTSD face difficulties in managing their PTSD severity after
suffering from a stroke. Currently, clinical trials in PTSD exclude patients with stroke and patients
with significant premorbid psychological conditions like PTSD are usually excluded from stroke
clinical trials. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a central nervous system stimulant that blocks dopamine
and norepinephrine transporters, selectively increasing prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity. MPH can
improve PTSD symptoms: avoidance behaviors, social withdrawal, hyperarousal, and working
memory. The suspected mechanism is MPH activates PFC, enhancing fear extinction [60] and
improving PTSD symptoms. MPH can also improve post-stroke outcomes: mood, activities of
daily living, and motor functioning. In clinical trials for PTSD or stroke, MPH has been shown to
be well-tolerated with minimal adverse events. The high prevalence of PTSD in Veterans with
stroke provides strong justification for development of interventions that effectively and
simultaneously target both conditions. The overarching goal of our proposal is to understand
how MPH improves PTSD severity in Veterans with comorbid stroke.
 This proposal is a single-site, phase 2, randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of
MPH in the treatment of Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD who are within 1-12 months of
cerebral stroke. The purpose of the clinical trial is to evaluate the therapeutic effects on PTSD
symptoms and post-stroke recovery of placebo-controlled MPH in Veterans diagnosed with
PTSD and cerebral stroke. The outcome of the proposed work is expected to develop an
intervention for patients with PTSD and stroke, thus improving their outcome by reducing
symptom severity. Following successful screening and baseline randomization, eligible patients
will be treated with a regimen of MPH vs placebo and treated for 12 weeks. They are assessed
every 4 weeks (4, 8, 12) followed by a 2-week taper period and concluding with a [final follow-
up at 30 days.] 50 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to placebo or MPH.
Aim 1: Determine the feasibility of the efficacy study design in comparing rTMS and exercise
versus sham rTMS and exercise to reduce pain in patients with chronic post-stroke pain.
 Hypothesis 1: Our feasibility pilot proposal will focus on collecting limited efficacy data for
 effect-size estimation to conduct a larger clinical trial using validated pain and functional
 measures in patients with chronic post-stroke pain using rTMS and exercise.
Aim 2: Evaluate the safety of rTMS combined with aerobic exercise in patients with a history of
ischemic stroke and chronic post-stroke pain.
 Hypothesis 2: The combined intervention of aerobic exercise plus rTMS will have both a low
 number of adverse events and a similar rate as aerobic exercise plus sham rTMS.
Aim 3: To assess the correlation between the neuronal connectivity of the prefrontal cortex with
PTSD outcomes and stroke outcomes following MPH vs Placebo in Veterans.
 Hypothesis 3: Compared to placebo, Veterans receiving MPH will show enhanced
 strengthening of the structural and functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex with other
 regional structures. This strengthened connectivity will correlate to changes in PTSD and
 Stroke outcomes."
10738763,"SUMMARY
By integrating our expertise in persister cell biology with advanced current technologies, our overall goals in this
project are to characterize a self-digestion-mediated persistence mechanism in bacteria and to explore the
therapeutic potential of this process. Bacterial persisters are rare phenotypic variants that are temporarily tolerant
to high concentrations of antibiotics. These variants are generally nongrowing cells that are genetically identical
to their antibiotic-susceptible kin. Persister cells facilitate the recurrence of chronic infections and serve as a
reservoir for the emergence of drug resistance mutants. As such, elimination of these cells improves clinical
outcomes for the majority of hospital-treated infections, but effective methods for persister elimination remain
limited. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that self-digestion is a mechanism for persister cell formation
in bacterial species. Therefore, deciphering the essential components of this mechanism can potentially provide
a global treatment approach, as self-digestion is a hallmark of many bacterial species. In our previous studies,
we discovered that persisters are mostly derived from stationary-phase cells with a high redox activity that is
maintained by endogenous protein and RNA degradation (i.e., self-digestion). We further determined that loss
of stationary-phase metabolic activity reduces persister levels by preventing the digestion of endogenous
proteins and RNA, yielding cells with enhanced antibiotic sensitivity. Inspired by these promising results, we
propose the following specific aims to explore our central hypothesis. (Aim 1) We will map the self-digestion-
related mechanisms in our model organism, Escherichia coli, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, reporter
plasmids, gene deletions, chemical inhibitors, metabolomics technology, and novel assays that we have
developed to quantify persisters, viable but non-culturable cells, and intracellular degradation. We will further
test our hypothesis using a clinically relevant microorganism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is the
predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients with compromised immune systems. (Aim
2) We will utilize a degradable fluorescent protein to develop a novel screening approach for rapidly identifying
chemical compounds that can eradicate persister cells by perturbing the self-digestion mechanisms in E. coli
and P. aeruginosa. The effects of candidate inhibitors on persister levels will be further tested under in vivo
conditions in a mouse model of high cell density infections. Our study is novel and significant on many levels.
Our approach to address our central hypothesis is conceptually innovative. In addition, mapping of this
comprehensive bacterial pathway from its initial exogenous trigger, through its signal transduction, to the source
of antibiotic tolerance, will enable us to develop affective antipersister therapeutics. Finally, this research
program will have a clinical impact by providing a platform to study persistence in different bacterial species and
by serving as a bridge from laboratory investigations to clinical trials."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease in the United States. NAFLD is a
conglomerate of the relatively nonprogressive non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and progressive non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH). While hepatic steatosis is a conserved feature of both NAFL and NASH, the latter is
characterized by liver injury, inflammation, fibrosis, and the risk of liver cancer and cirrhosis. At the present time,
there are no effective noninvasive and scalable screening strategies to distinguish between NAFL and NASH
nor monitor NASH progression. Thus, there is a significant unmet need for biomarkers which are relatively easy
to obtain, can be tested repeatedly over time, can distinguish NAFL from NASH, are pathophysiologically in-
formed, and help risk stratify patients with NASH. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry signals from diseased cells
and organs and therefore represent ideal biomarkers for NAFL and NASH. However, the development of EV
based biomarkers has been confounded by several challenges. First challenge relates to the large sample
volume requirements of mass spectrometry approaches traditionally used for EV analysis (e.g. LC-MS/MS). This
limits their utility for the analysis of scarce patient samples. Second challenge lies in the fact that EVs released
from the diseased liver become diluted by circulation and represent only a small subset (~1%) of total EVs
present in peripheral blood. This makes it difficult to identify biomarkers of disease progression or therapy re-
sponse. In this project, we will address the aforementioned challenges by developing novel technologies: 1)
nanoprojectile (NP) secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) that will enable multiplexed analysis of EVs using
microliters of sample and 2) microfluidic organotypic liver cultures that will allow us to harvest undiluted liver EVs
from healthy or diseased tissue.
Upon completion of this project, we will have in hand a powerful mass spectrometry technology for proteomic
and lipidomic analysis of EVs. The identification of EV biomarkers in this project will, in the future, be parlayed
into a blood-based test that will allow to diagnose NAFLD, distinguish NAFL from NASH and help risk stratify
patients. Such a test will replace highly invasive liver biopsy currently used for diagnosis and will revolutionize
the care of patients with NAFLD. It will also allow early diagnosis of NASH in at risk populations."
10911320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aneuploidy, the gain or loss of whole chromosomes or chromosome arms, is a near-universal feature of cancer.
However, the role of aneuploidy in tumor pathogenesis remains an unanswered question in cancer biology.
Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), whether in the lung, esophagus or head and neck, are characterized by
specific patterns of aneuploidy. In many SCCs, unlike other cancer types, there are fewer oncogenic mutations
identified resulting in few targeted therapies available for patients. However, SCCs are characterized by a distinct
aneuploidy profile. In particular, chromosome arm 3p is lost in almost 80% of lung SCCs, with gain of
chromosome arm 3q the next most frequent event in this cancer type. Our preliminary data suggest that these
two aneuploidy events play an important role in oncogenesis in this tumor type and may be a useful disease
target.
The goal of this proposal is to understand the phenotypic consequences of chromosome 3 arm aneuploidies.
We have previously developed a genome engineering approach to delete chromosome arm 3p in human lung
epithelial cells. With this approach, we also isolated isogenic cell lines with chromosome 3q gain. Using this
model system, here we will explore three pathways affected by these aneuploidy events: (1) lipid and PI3K
signaling in cells with chromosome 3q gain, (2) hypoxia response and VHL haploinsufficiency in cells with
chromosome 3p deletion, and (3) squamous differentiation and tumorigenesis. By determining the effect of
chromosome 3p deletion and chromosome 3q gain in lung cells, we will gain insights into how a patient-specific
aneuploidy contributes to tumor development. These studies may also identify novel therapeutic targets for
treatment of SCCs."

The overarching goal of this Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) Development and Trial Center (T-PDTC) is to
develop functional precision combination therapies that can be translated into clinical trials to overcome drug
resistance and produce to long-term responses improving the outcomes of melanoma patients. The melanoma
treatment landscape has radically improved in the past decade due to availability of new immune- and targeted-
therapies available. Targeted therapies using BRAF and MEK inhibitors have been approved for patients with
BRAFV600E/K mutations, which are present in ~50% of cutaneous melanomas. These treatments elicit clinical
responses in ~80% of BRAFV600 mutant patients. However, most patients eventually progress. Additionally, there
are no effective targeted therapies for patients whose tumors harbor wild-type BRAF. Thus, there is an urgent
unmet clinical need to develop efficacious treatments to prevent or overcome resistance to current FDA-
approved therapies. To facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies that can be translated into clinical
trials, we have developed a broad collection of PDX models that reflects the clinical, histological, and genetic
heterogeneity of melanoma. Our collection of >500 PDX models represents one of the largest collections for any
human malignancy. Our initial studies have demonstrated that our PDX collection recapitulates the molecular
heterogeneity observed in patients. This collection also includes a subset of PDX established from patients with
intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted- and immune-therapies and rare melanoma subtypes. These efforts
have generated a robust pre-clinical resource to develop, refine, and prioritize new functional precision
combinatorial therapies for melanoma patients. This T-PDTC constitutes a multi-disciplinary and multi-
institutional Program focused on the use and continued expansion of our melanoma PDX collection and
organoids to identify new therapeutic combination approaches that will fill important clinical gaps. The Program
consists of two research projects and three Cores from a team that has worked extremely well together over the
last five years, publishing high-impact collaborative papers. The Research Projects are designed to develop
functional precision combination therapies for the most challenging types of melanomas: those that are resistant
to current therapies and tumors that lack BRAF-mutations (BRAFWT). We will map the molecular landscape of
our melanoma PDXs and organoids by integrating DNA, RNA, and protein data to nominate combination
therapies matching their molecular profile. We will develop and implement mechanism-based preclinical trials of
drug combinations in our large set of molecularly characterized PDXs. To do this, we will focus on NCI-
Investigational New Drug (IND) agents to advance melanoma precision therapy, while offsetting drug resistance
and producing durable responses. We expect to gain new mechanistic knowledge about the biology of drug
resistant melanoma that will lead to improved and durable precision therapies. We expect to identify biomarkers
to select tumors for specific treatments and provide data-driven recommendations for early phase clinical trials."

Significant progress has been made in identification of key components of the adult bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) niche that are critical for maintaining the function of rare, long-term self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC). In particular, perivascular MSC expressing high levels of Cxcl12 and stem cell factor (Scf) and cell-surface markers including Lepr, Pdgfrα, and CD51, have been localized in very close proximity to LT-HSC and likely contribute to the maintenance of LT-HSC quiescence during steady-state hematopoiesis. We have shown that clonally-derived, Lepr+CD146+Pdgfrα+CD51+Scf+Cxcl12HI primary murine adult BM MSC lines with in vitro and in vivo multilineage developmental potential can significantly enhance the ability of LT-HSC to self-renew after 10 days of co-culturing 20 FACS-sorted LT-HSC with the MSC lines. Further, we show that LT-HSC self-renewal/survival could be further enhanced by increasing MSC expression of the evolutionarily-related noncanonical Wnt ligands, Wnt11 and Wnt5a, which potently suppressed canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, ectopic expression of the canonical Wnt ligands, Wnt3a or Wnt10b, in MSC resulted in loss of transplantable LT-HSC after co-culture, rapid upregulation of an osteolineage gene expression profile in MSC, and upregulation of both endogenous Wnt11 and Wnt5a expression, suggesting activation of a negative feedback loop that would suppress further canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, we observed that loss of Wnt11 in Prx1+ MSC in vivo increases trabecular bone number in 3-week-old mice, which supports a function for Wnt11 in suppressing MSC differentiation specifically to the osteoblastic cell lineage. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that noncanonical Wnt signaling maintained by both Wnt11 and Wnt5a preserves self-renewal and multipotency of both LT-HSC and MSC within the BM niche. This hypothesis will be addressed in two Aims. Aim 1 will examine whether Wnt11 and Wnt5a coordinately control both LT-HSC and MSC self-renewal and multilineage developmental potential using LT-HSC/MSC co-cultures and primary MSC sublines where biallelic deletions of Wnt11 and Wnt5a can be induced with Cre recombinase. Aim 2 will assess the function of Wnt11 and Wnt5a in regulating LT-HSC and MSC homeostasis in vivo using Prx1-CreER or Wnt11-CreER mice to conditionally delete floxed alleles of Wnt11 and/or Wnt5a in adult BM MSC. Using Wnt11-CreERT;Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato;a-catulinGFP reporter mice, we will also determine the proximity of Wnt11+ MSC with respect to LT-HSC in BM and define the contribution of Wnt11+ MSC to the osteoblast, adipocyte and chondrocyte cell lineages in unperturbed conditions. Together, these studies will be important for understanding noncanonical Wnt signaling-dependent mechanisms that coordinate the life-long production of blood and bone-forming cells by LT-HSC and MSC, which are likely in direct cell-cell contact in vivo. This knowledge can then be applied to enhance the efficacy of stem cell transplantation, tissue repair, and targeted gene correction approaches that benefit patients in the clinic. 
SPECIFIC AIMS: Numerous studies have shed light on the cellular and molecular factors that control adult long-term self-renewing hematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) self-renewal and differentiation during steady-state and stress hematopoiesis. It is appreciated that a number of cell types including various mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) subsets, sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC), arterioles, neuronal cells, macrophage, and megakaryocytes all contribute to regulation of HSC homeostasis within the bone marrow (BM) niche 1-7. Using deep confocal imaging of optically cleared BM and highly specific LT-HSC markers like α-catulin, showed that the vast majority of quiescent and dividing LT-HSC are localized near SEC and MSC expressing leptin receptor (Lepr) and high levels of Cxcl128. Other imaging and cell ablation studies have further highlighted the close approximation of LT-HSC with perivascular MSC that express a Nestin-GFP transgene 9 and other cell-surface markers and secreted factors including CD51, Pdgfrα, CD146, and stem cell factor (Scf)10-17. Deletion of Scf from either perivascular MSC or endothelial cells using Lepr-Cre or Tie2-Cre depleted HSC numbers, which was not observed when Scf was deleted from hematopoietic cells, osteoblasts, or Nestin-Cre+ cells 18. Since membrane-bound Scf is essential for maintaining LT-HSC in vivo 19,20, LT-HSC are likely in direct contact with Scf-expressing perivascular MSC during steady-state hematopoiesis in adult mice. 
 Using clonally-derived, Lepr+CD146+Pdgfrα+CD51+Scf+Cxcl12HI primary murine adult BM MSC lines with in vitro and in vivo multilineage developmental potential, we showed that Wnt signaling modulated the ability of LT-HSC to self-renew in long-term co-cultures of 20 FACS-sorted LT-HSC and the clonal MSC lines 21. These MSC lines express high levels of Wnt ligands that activate noncanonical Wnt signaling, particularly Wnt11 and Wnt5a, which potently suppress the canonical (α-catenin-dependent) pathway. This was consistent with the lack of expression of the canonical Wnt target gene, Axin2, in both LT-HSC and MSC in the co-cultures 21. Wnt11 and Wnt5a are also highly expressed in the most primitive, self-renewing adult BM skeletal stem cell subset (mSSC) that gives rise to bone and cartilage in vivo 22, in Nestin-GFP+ stromal cells 23, in Osterix-expressing osteolineage cells 24, and in adult BM stromal progenitor cells by single-cell RNAseq 25. In preliminary co-culture studies, we show that activation of canonical Wnt signaling in the MSC lines through ectopic expression of either Wnt3a or Wnt10b stimulates loss of LT-HSC self-renewal and/or survival and potently activates an osteolineage gene expression program in MSC. Conversely, overexpression of Wnt11 or Wnt5a in MSC enhanced LT-HSC long-term repopulating activity and blocked activation of an osteolineage gene signature in MSC. Further, deletion of Wnt11 in MSC using Prx1-Cre increased deposition of trabecular bone in newborn mice, which suggests an important role for Wnt11 in suppressing osteolineage differentiation of MSC induced by canonical Wnt signaling. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that noncanonical Wnt signaling in MSC maintained by Wnt11 and Wnt5a is essential to preserve the self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential of both LT-HSC and MSC in the BM niche in order to sustain life-long blood cell and bone production. This hypothesis will be addressed in the following Specific Aims:
 Aim 1: Functionally define whether Wnt11 and Wnt5a coordinately control both LT-HSC and MSC self-renewal and multilineage developmental potential using LT-HSC/MSC co-cultures and primary MSC sublines with Cre-inducible, biallelic floxed alleles of both Wnt11 and Wnt5a. Transplantation studies will address whether the absence of either Wnt11 or Wnt5a, or both Wnt11/Wnt5a, in MSC results in loss of LT-HSC reconstitution potential after LT-HSC/MSC co-culture in vitro. The ability of MSC to self-renewal in the absence of Wnt11/Wnt5a will be assessed by CFU-F assays, while biased and irreversible activation of MSC commitment to the osteoblast lineage due to the inability to suppress canonical Wnt signaling in MSC will be assessed using osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic growth conditions in vitro and in vivo. 
 Aim 2: Define the unique and redundant functions of Wnt11 and Wnt5a in sustaining adult BM LT-HSC and MSC self-renewal and multilineage developmental potential in vivo during homeostasis. Here, we will use Prx1-Cre, Prx1-CreERT and Wnt11-CreERT mice to delete Wnt11, Wnt5a, or both Wnt11 and Wnt5a, to determine whether they are both essential for maintaining LT-HSC and MSC self-renewal in vivo. We will use Wnt11-CreERT;Rosa26-LSL-tdTomato;a-catulinGFP mice to determine localization of Wnt11-expressing MSC with respect to LT-HSC in adult BM, and for lineage tracing to determine the contribution of tdTomato+ MSC to the osteoblast, adipocyte and chondrocyte cell lineages in an unperturbed setting in vivo. 
 Defining factors that preserve life-long maintenance of both blood-forming LT-HSC and bone-forming MSC has been a fundamental challenge since loss of factors controlling an essential function like self-renewal of either stem cell population would likely result in embryonic lethality. This study will utilize inducible, floxed alleles of the noncanonical Wnt ligands, Wnt11 and Wnt5a, to elucidate their role in coordinate regulation of both adult LT-HSC and MSC self-renewal. Developing a deeper understanding of factors regulating crosstalk between LT-HSC and MSC, which are likely in direct cell-cell contact in adult BM, will significantly enhance our ability to manipulate LT-HSC and MSC in vitro, with the goal of improving the efficacy of stem cell transplantation, tissue repair, and targeted gene correction approaches that can then be applied in the clinic.

10909331,"RESEARCH PROJECT 1: Enhancing Neoadjuvant Therapy To Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence
PROJECT SUMMARY
Based on our strong preliminary and published data, our overarching hypothesis guiding the project is that agents
that enhance response to neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy will decrease recurrence rates by reduction
or elimination of minimal residual disease. These targeted agents may also function in combination with one
another, which may allow elimination of cytotoxic systemic chemotherapy. We further hypothesize that response
data can be used to refine computational methods for drug response prediction.
Aside from study of frank resistance to chemotherapies, which is also possible using our combined PDX platform,
study of minimal residual disease, as well as both local and distant recurrence is also important, particularly in
PDX derived from racial groups whose disease outcomes are worse than those in Caucasian women (i.e. African
American and Hispanic women). Under our current PDTC, we have already identified seven PDX as recurrent
after apparent complete response (CR) to combination carboplatin/docetaxel. We will apply a refined set of
computationally determined predictive signatures of differential response to carboplatin and taxanes (paclitaxel
going forward to match an upcoming clinical trial) to the remainder of TNBC in our combined PDX collection,
as well as to TNBC PDX to be created in both PDTC projects to identify PDX most likely to show complete
response to the combination. Importantly, response to either carboplatin or docetaxel correlates with response to
their combination 86% of the time. Existing and new PDX will be evaluated for CR and recurrence in response
to combination chemotherapy in Aim 1, with the ultimate goal of identifying a total of at least 20, but optimally
30, recurrent PDX models for testing of the ability of targeted agents computationally predicted to augment
chemotherapy response in Aim 2 to reduce or prevent recurrence in Aim 3."
10881782,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The myriad of both newly-available molecular targets and novel anti-cancer agents has underscored the crucial
need to develop preclinical models in order to optimize clinical trial design. Several technical benefits make
patient-derived xenograft (PDXs) models particularly attractive for drug testing and personalized medicine.
Biologists and physicians at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) and the Siteman Cancer Center
(SCC) developed and operated the Washington University PDX Development and Trial Center (WU-PDTC) as
part of the PDXNet program during a prior funding period (CA224083) from 2017-2022. Based on the success
of this program, we propose to renew WU-PDTC funding as a T-PDTC with the goal of continuing our efforts in
preclinical testing and prioritizing and studying unmet needs in cancer in this collaborative, nation-wide effort.
The PDX Core within WU-PDTC will develop and characterize 400 new PDX models across major tumor types.
These models will be characterized using the latest omics technologies and analyzed using the most current
bioinformatics pipelines that have been deployed for PDXNet and other large scale NCI programs. Tumors
representing unmet needs and priority areas for collection will be emphasized (e.g. treatment resistant cancers).
The Bioinformatics Core will integrate these analyses with clinical annotation from the originating patient to
include treatment history and tumor response (Aim 1). Our two Research Projects will conduct PDX clinical trials
of single and combination agents using drugs in the NCI CTEP portfolio (Aim 2). Project 1 will investigate
predictive biomarkers and resistance mechanisms for DS-8201a alone and in combination with DDRi in breast
cancer (expanding to GI and lung cancers), while Project 2 will study targeting the onco-inflammatory circuitry in
combination with anti-KRAS and chemotherapies in GI and lung cancer (this will expand to breast cancer).
Proteogenomic, imaging, and clinical response data will be collected for these models as part of a broader effort
of characterizing PDX models and conducting clinical correlation and treatment response analyses by the
Bioinformatics Core (Aim 3). Proteogenomic features of PDX models and treatment/response histories will be
tracked using our well-established WU-PDXdb that will be accessible to PDXNet and PDMR-FNLCR. In Aim 4,
the WU-PDTC will leverage existing expertise and programs from Siteman Cancer Center (SCC), Institute of
Clinical and Translational Research (ITCS), McDonnell Genome Institute (MGI), Mallinkrodt Imaging Research
Center (MIRC), and Early Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) to support the goals of developing and
utilizing PDX models to test and improve cancer treatment, in collaboration with other components of PDXNet.
Finally, WU-PDTC, through coordination by the Administration Core, will support Pilot Projects utilizing these
PDX resources to foster collaboration across PDTCs, PDMR-FNLCR, and other NCI programs (Aim 5). In
summary, the goals are to increase the spectrum of agents tested in PDX clinical trials and to improve the
reliability, validation, utility, and standardization of PDX models through innovative cross-PDXNet research."
10881937,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The overall goal of the University of Pennsylvania PDX Development and Therapeutics Center (UP-PDTC) is
to (i) exploit the translational potential of PDX models for evaluating the response of various treatments in
models with specific molecular characteristics and to (ii) work with PDXNet to enhance and extend use of PDX
models to the research community with the goal to guide development of human Phase 1/2 clinical trials for
human malignancies. As PDX models more faithfully reproduce human cancer than cell lines, they can
contribute to the ultimate clinical implementation of cancer precision medicine. The UP-PDTC is uniquely
poised to contribute to such research due to the long history of PDX research at UPENN. The UP-PDTC will
comprise 4 Cores and 2 projects. The four Cores are: Administrative, PDX, Pilot Projects and Trans-Network,
and a Bioinformatics Core. The Administrative Core will coordinate all UP-PDTC activities. The PDX Core
builds on 15 years of experience within the Stem Cell and Xenograft Core facility of UPENN. The PDX Core
currently provides over 900 mice per month to investigators at UPENN using PDX modeling for malignant and
non-malignant disease. The animal facility of the PDX Core is a dedicated 6 room suite controlled by highly
skilled PDX Core personnel with comprehensive infection control measures. Using these measures, the PDX
Core has not had a significant infection in the colony in seven years. The Pilot Projects Core will take
advantage of a growing group of collaborators to build tissue banks for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), breast cancer, glioblastoma, and myeloma. A major goal of the UP-PDTC is
to develop and characterize new models across common and rare cancer types that can be linked with the
originating patient clinical response profile and shared with PDXNet. The Bioinformatics Core takes advantage
of the extensive Bioinformatics infrastructure at UPENN and will work with the Projects to more rigorously
describe PDX modeling for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ovarian cancer. There are two projects. Project
One is directed by Dr. Martin Carroll and will focus on acute myeloid leukemia. Project 1 takes advantage of
one of the largest tissue banks of viable, fully annotated AML samples in the world. This tissue bank currently
has over 3300 collections from over 1700 patients collected over 20 years including over 40 PDX primograft
models currently available of over 100 that have been described. Dr. Carroll, working with members of the
PDX Core, has a long history of developing and using the AML PDX model to define AML biology and
responses to therapy. Project 2 is directed by Dr. Fiona Simpkins and takes advantage of the Ovarian Cancer
Research Center Tumor BioTrust Collection. This collection is fifteen years old, also fully annotated and
includes 140 well characterized PDX models. Drs. Carroll and Simpkins, have extensive experience in
xenotransplantation models and in the use of xenotransplantation models to both understand disease biology
and develop new therapeutic approaches for implementation in clinical trials. In their projects, they propose
two discrete xenotransplantation Phase 2 studies. Dr. Carroll will test the effects of a combined therapy with
Menin inhibition and KAT6A inhibition on AML differentiation and disease burden. Dr. Simpkins will study
TP53 wild type clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) and low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (LGSOC) and
their response in PDX models to a “p53 stabilizer combination” (MDM2 and XPO1 inhibition). Both Dr. Carroll
and Dr. Simpkins have significant experience moving pre-clinical work into human early-stage clinical trials and
we anticipate that these xenotransplant phase 2 (XP2) studies will lead to molecular defined Phase 1/2 human
studies. Overall, the unique resources of the UP-PDTC should enhance the use of PDX models for robust and
reproducible studies that will lead to precision targeted therapeutics in humans."
10733091,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core's purpose is to coordinate and facilitate activities across all Research Projects and the
Community Engagement Core (CEC) to ensure synergy across the North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae,
People, and Environment (NC C-CAPE). The Administrative Core's Specific Aims include: 1) Create and
coordinate a centralized hub for NC C-CAPE activities; 2) Provide systems and processes that foster
transdisciplinary interactions between NC C-CAPE research projects and cores; and 3) Implement
mechanisms that facilitate translation of NC C-CAPE discoveries and broaden the impact of Center
findings. The Administrative Core will be led by an Internal Steering Committee consisting of the Center Director,
Co-Director, Project 3 Leader, and CEC Director. This collaborative leadership approach reflects the recognized
need for multiple areas of expertise – oceanography, environmental health, climate modeling, and community
engagement – to be engaged in decision-making that impacts the Center as a whole. A full-time Business
Manager, with coordinated effort across both the Administrative Core and CEC, will manage logistics of Center
activities, track Center-wide metrics in support of the program evaluation plan, and promote communication
across the Center, NC State leadership, and the NC C-CAPE external stakeholders. The Administrative Core
will foster interdisciplinary approaches by striking a balance between efforts internally, such as coordinating a
research seminar series, and externally, through activities such as convening the External Advisory Committee
and collaborating with other Oceans and Human Health Centers and projects with shared interests. Driven by
the CEC's leadership, NC C-CAPE has adopted a data justice framework that shapes our approach to
Resource Sharing. The Administrative Core will ensure that this framework, including a commitment to making
data both publicly available and accessible, will be implemented across all Research Projects. Importantly, this
framing of data justice will also inform the Center's efforts around developing early stage investigators. The
Administrative Core will help facilitate co-mentoring across the Research Projects and the Community
Engagement Core to give students and other early stage researchers opportunities to understand how their
scientific areas can collaborate with other disciplines and stakeholders around the topic of sharing data. By
setting an organizational culture that fosters collaborations across disciplinary boundaries, the Administrative
Core will assist the Center in advancing our understanding of how climate, algal blooms, ocean, animal and
human health are connected."
10733092,"ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
The Community Engagement Core's (CEC) overall goal is to ensure that community member expertise is
incorporated into both the design and dissemination of all research and engagement activities. The CEC will
accomplish this through a data justice framework. Data justice is defined in this proposal as fair procedures for
making people and environmental harms visible through data. The CEC's specific aims include: 1) Improve
researcher and community capacity for data justice; 2) Fill critical data gaps by increasing participation
in community science initiatives; and 3) Enhance the relevancy of NC C-CAPE research to environmental
health advocacy led by Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) communities. To address the
tensions and power dynamics inherent in engaged research, we will produce a data governance charter, create
data justice curricula, convene workshops, and build critical infrastructure to transform existing citizen science
projects into a connected enterprise that fills data gaps in order to better understand and reduce environmental
health disparities. Efforts will transform anglers and boaters likely to volunteer for citizen science into community
scientists using recruitment methods to steer data collection toward gaps that meet the priorities and needs
expressed by BIPOC community leaders in workshops. The CEC will be governed by a Community Advisory
Board consisting of community environmental and health experts from coastal North Carolina and the Internal
Steering Committee consisting of the Center Director, Co-Director, Project 3 Leader, and Dr. Cutts, an
environmental justice researcher, as the CEC Director. A full-time Business Manager will devote effort to both
the Administrative Core and CEC, to align logistics of Center activities, track Center-wide metrics in support of
the program evaluation plan, and accountability to NC C-CAPE partners and stakeholders. Additional hourly
staff will train and educate community specialists living and working in coastal North Carolina. NC C-CAPE will
provide significant insight to guide efforts to implement effective monitoring approaches, inform guideline values
for safe consumption of water and seafood, deliver predictive tools to assess emergent and future toxin exposure
risk, and will leverage community engagement initiatives to fill data gaps to improve oceans and human health."
10733093,"ABSTRACT – RESEARCH PROJECT 1
The primary objective of Project 1, as an integral component of the North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae,
People, and Environment (NC C-CAPE), will be to address significant public health risks due to the proliferation
of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in coastal waters. The transfer of cyanobacterial toxins, specifically microcystins
(MCs), to oysters and blue crabs has been verified at five sites across NC's estuarine habitats, raising concerns
about hepatotoxic shellfish poisoning (HSP) from human shellfish consumption. This project aims to advance
our understanding of current and future ecosystem and human health risks from HABs by collecting pivotal
information on MC distribution and toxin mixtures, and by determining the scope of seafood contamination to
guide stakeholder mitigation efforts, inform risk assessment and prediction, and aid animal and human health
studies. Aim 1 is to characterize the environmental conditions that lead to increased MC and
cyanobacterial presence in Pamlico Sound to test the hypothesis that increases are observed in response to
site-specific shifts in environmental and hydrological conditions (e.g., salinity, temperature), and will primarily be
associated with increased transport from upriver sources following severe weather events. Field sampling will
involve cutting-edge real-time sensing platforms, event-driven sampling, and routine monitoring to determine
species composition, toxin concentrations and mixtures within the largest US lagoonal estuary, the Pamlico
Albemarle Sound System. Aim 2 is to quantify MC contamination in shellfish to test our hypothesis that MC
transfer to oysters and blue crabs is widespread and linked to downstream transport of cells and toxins. Shellfish
from Pamlico Sound will be analyzed for MC body burdens and relationships with cyanobacterial abundance and
toxin patterns in the surrounding environments and pertinent physicochemical conditions. Aim 3 is to
characterize the temperature-dependent kinetics of MC transfer and detoxification in oysters and co-
occurring predator the blue crab. We will test the hypothesis that MC transfer from lower trophic levels
(oysters) to higher trophic levels (blue crabs) represents a balance between bioaccumulation and detoxification
(i.e., dilution) and that climate-induced changes in temperature will affect future risks related to shellfish body
burdens and HSP to human health. Project 1 will inform Project 2 with the overall goal of understanding human
health risks associated with the exposure to MCs and MC mixtures, provide Project 3 with diverse algal bloom
metrics and environmental covariates for integration and probabilistic modeling to assess and predict the spatial
and temporal variability in cyanotoxin levels under current and future climate scenarios, and Project 1
researchers will participate in center-wide initiatives by NC C-CAPE's Community Engagement Core to
translate project findings, to build data sharing practices to connect with community stakeholders, and participate
in community science initiatives."
10733094,"ABSTRACT – RESEARCH PROJECT 2
The primary objective for Project 2 of the North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae, People, and Environment
(NC C-CAPE), is to define the toxicity of human and environmentally relevant microcystin (MC) mixtures found
in recent harmful algal blooms (HABs) and seafood biomonitoring efforts in Project 1, and predicted in future
HABs through modeling data of Project 3. Aim 1 will address the biomedical research component of NC C-
CAPE by leveraging the specimens and questionnaire data repository of the ongoing Southern Liver Health
Study. This secondary analysis will determine the extent to which MCs, including MC-LR and -RR, increase the
risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases and liver cancer in Eastern North Carolina populations. The geographic
focus for this nested case-control study is the Pamlico Albemarle Sound System (PASS) of Eastern North
Carolina, one of the most impacted waterways in the region, but the results and lessons learned will be
generalizable across coastal communities and the Great Lakes where HABs and MC toxin exposures occur.
Recent regulatory assessment of evidence for MC carcinogenicity concluded that there was essentially no
human data useful for risk assessment of MC carcinogenicity; therefore, Aim 1 will fill a crucial data gap.
Furthermore, Aims 2 and 3 will comprehensively evaluate adverse impacts of MC-LR/-RR mixtures found in
PASS HABs (Project 1) and define how the ubiquitous PFAS pollutant PFOS impacts MC toxicity. The dose
responsiveness of liver toxicity, biomarkers of NAFLD, and hepatocellular carcinoma will be assessed in male
and female CD1(ICR) mice chronically exposed to MC-LR alone or in combination with MC-RR, and/or
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) in drinking water. Mechanistic studies using a 3D model of differentiated
HepG2 spheroids and chemical combination analysis, will evaluate the impacts of MC-RR on MC-LR active
transporter uptake mechanism and will define mechanisms of MC-mixture toxicity. Together the proposed
research of Project 2 is especially relevant to public health and the goals outlined by NIEHS for the Centers for
Oceans and Human Health because it will elucidate how exposures to microcystin congeners alone, or in
combination with other environmental contaminates including toxic metals and perfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS), interact to induce liver toxicity (short-term outcome), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and progression
to liver cancer (long-term outcomes). The experiments and analysis proposed in Project 2 of the NC C-CAPE
are highly significant and will address critical data gaps in the understanding of MC toxicity and impacts on
human health, and will yield critical data needed to implement regulatory policy change, interventions, and public
and clinical health measures to limit adverse impacts of MC toxins on liver disease and its progression to
hepatocellular carcinoma."
10851830,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disease in pregnancy that is a leading cause of adverse maternal and fetal
outcomes in the US. Decades of clinical studies demonstrate that levels of the adipokine leptin inappropriately
increase, independent of body mass, in PE patients. However, whether leptin plays a role in the cardiovascular
and fetal outcomes of PE is unknown. We recently established a mouse model of leptin-induced PE, in which
exogenous leptin administration induces the clinical characteristics of PE in endothelial dysfunction,
hypertension, placental mitochondrial dysfunction and fetal growth restriction when given in mid-late gestation
pregnant mice. The goal of this proposal is to address a critical gap in knowledge regarding the stimuli
upregulating leptin in PE and to investigate mechanisms via which leptin induces adverse maternal and fetal
adaptations. Our central hypothesis is that sFlt-1 induces hyperleptinemia in PE, which promotes
hypertension and fetal growth restriction via endothelial dysfunction. Placental ischemia is a key initiating
event in PE and induces an anti-angiogenic milieu, most notably increasing soluble FMS like tyrosine kinase-1
(sFlt-1), the soluble form of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1). We show novel preliminary
data that sFlt-1 increases leptin production in both humans and mice. We also demonstrate that placental
ischemia, induced in the Reduced Uterine Perfusion Pressure (RUPP) mouse model of PE, increases circulating
leptin as well as sFlt-1. We will test in Aim 1 whether placental ischemia increases leptin levels via sFlt-1, which
mediates placental ischemia-induced endothelial and placental dysfunction. In this Aim, we propose that the
RUPP mouse develops endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, placental mitochondrial dysfunction and fetal
growth restriction, characteristics of PE, via leptin-mediated mechanisms. We will additionally investigate
whether sFlt-1 sequestration of VEGF reduces VEGF receptor signaling and promotes leptin production in PE.
Additional innovative preliminary data shows that endothelial leptin receptor activation increases the
production of endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) in pregnant mice. We further
demonstrate that leptin upregulates endothelial mineralocorticoid receptor expression, which we have published
decreases ECE-1 expression. Therefore, in Aim 2 we will test whether leptin induces PE characteristics via
endothelial ET-1-mediated endothelial dysfunction. We will utilize mice with endothelial mineralocorticoid
receptor deletion as well as endothelial leptin receptor knockout mice to determine whether leptin-induced ET-1
expression by these endothelial pathways leads to PE characteristics in pregnant mice. We will further determine
whether ECE-1 induces vascular endothelial dysfunction and whether ECE-1 or ET-1 receptor antagonism
ablates leptin-induced PE. Collectively, the results of Aim 1 and 2 will significantly move forward the field
of leptin in PE and will give preclinical evidence if regulatory or downstream mechanisms of leptin in PE are
potential therapeutics to improve clinical care of PE patients."
10853007,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for up to 17% of all epilepsy-related deaths, and
50% for those refractory to treatment. There is increasing evidence that apnea (respiratory arrest) is the
primary cause of death from SUDEP. We have shown in a number of mouse models - including PTZ injection,
rapid kindling (prelim. data), and mouse models harboring Scn8a mutations identified from SUDEP patients -
that sudden death is due to seizure-induced apnea (SIA) that occurs during tonic seizures, minutes prior
to terminal asystole. As it pertains to this proposal, we have also made four other important observations:
1) artificial ventilation can prevent death and suppressed cardiac activity does not increase likelihood of fatality;
2) tonic contraction of breathing muscles represents a likely mechanism of SIA; 3) inhibition of cortical seizure
activity does not impact SIA; and 4) inhibition of the inspiratory oscillator does not reduce apnea (prelim. data),
suggesting seizure spread bypasses homeostatic elements of respiratory control circuitry. CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS: [AIM 1] Increased midbrain and pontine excitability is both necessary and sufficient to
produce SIA, [AIM 2] the parabrachial/kölliker fuse (PB/KF) nucleus in the pons represents a key nodal
point for SIA generation, and [AIM 3] that brainstem nuclei, like the PB/KF and PAG are recruited
specifically during SIA, which we will explore using electrophysiology and genetic mapping. AIM 1: We
have previously used chemogenetics to demonstrate that cortical ictal activity is not required for SIA and we now
propose that hyperexcitability of the pons and midbrain drive SIA and SUDEP. We will use chemogenetics to
inhibit different parts of the brainstem of Scn8a mutant mice to test their necessity for SIA and SUDEP.
Additionally, we will test sufficiency of these regions by selectively expressing an Scn8a mutation that increases
neuronal excitability. Using the rapid kindling model, we will also perform patch clamp recordings to test whether
increased neuronal excitability in these regions occurs concurrently with the development of SIA. AIM 2: The
parabrachial/kölliker fuse nucleus PB/KF in the Pons is a key nodal point for descending forebrain input and
projects past the inspiratory oscillator, and is modulated by the vagus nerve. In this aim, we will photoinhibit the
Foxp2-positive PB/KF neurons to regain normal breathing pattern during SIA, photostimulate P2ry1-positive
vagal afferent nerve fibers to interrupt inspiration during SIA, and determine if PB/KF and Npy2r-positive vagal
neuron photostimulation rescues postictal breathing in our PTZ SUDEP mouse model. AIM 3: We have
demonstrated that tonic seizures with SIA and clonic seizures without SIA can occur in the very same mouse,
both in Scn8a mutant and rapid kindling models (prelim. data) and that certain mid- and hindbrain structures are
activated during SIA. We will determine the neuronal circuitry activated specifically during SIA and SUDEP using
in vivo electrophysiology and TRAP2 identification of activated neurons."
10924061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed project addresses the need for a rigorous trial to test the effectiveness of novel gluten detection
technologies as an adjunct to telemedicine to manage celiac disease in adults. Celiac disease affects about 1%
of the United States (U.S.) population and seroprevalence has increased up to 5-fold in the U.S. since the 1950’s,
with diagnosis rates continuing to rise. Morbidity can be severe and includes anemia, infertility, osteoporosis,
and malignancies, which can increase all-cause mortality. The only proven therapy is a strict gluten-free diet, the
management of which can be extremely challenging and has been linked to diminished quality of life, including
anxiety, depression, and fatigue. Despite the recommendation to see a dietitian regularly, many with celiac
disease do not see one at all or have only a single session immediately post-diagnosis. The COVID-19 pandemic
has catalyzed the rapid adoption of telemedicine in gastroenterology and can facilitate communication between
patient and dietitian by eliminating the need to arrange face-to-face meetings at celiac disease centers, which
may be at great distance. Self-monitoring with new technologies for gluten detection in food (e.g., portable gluten
sensors) and urine (e.g., gluten immunogenic peptide kits) can facilitate greater individual awareness of gluten
exposures, are commercially available to the public, and have been shown to be valid and reliable. Physicians
and dietitians are being asked if these technologies should be used, and our preliminary studies have
demonstrated acceptability and feasibility, but their impact on clinical outcomes such as mucosal recovery and
symptoms has not been established. This U01 proposal is for a multi-center (New York, Massachusetts, Illinois,
Tennessee) randomized controlled trial (M-RCT) to assess the effectiveness and document costs of gluten
detection technologies as an adjunct to telemedicine on behavioral and clinical outcomes among newly
diagnosed patients with celiac disease. Participants will be randomized to receive either 1) standard of care (i.e.
a one-time in-person dietitian session plus telemedicine dietitian follow-up; or 2) standard of care + gluten
detection technologies. This would be the first large-scale clinical trial to test the effect of self-monitoring using
gluten detection technology in the management of celiac disease. The primary outcome will be mucosal recovery
12-months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes include change in gastrointestinal symptoms, diet
adherence, quality of life (including anxiety and depression), eating behaviors, intraepithelial lymphocyte counts
on histology, and celiac disease serology, all assessed at baseline and again at 12-months post-randomization.
If the primary endpoint of this proposed U01 is met, the intervention will improve mucosal recovery, promote a
shift in current practice of celiac disease management toward long-term monitoring, and represent a significant

Heart failure secondary to acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death and disability.
As a societal cost burden, heart failure care will be nearing $160 billion by 2030. Although emergent strategies
to re-establish coronary blood flow have substantially improved mortality, morbidity remains high. Paradoxically,
successful reperfusion may contribute to unintended microvascular injury with subsequent intramyocardial
hemorrhage. In 40-50% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, intramyocardial hemorrhage can
occur, leading to adverse effects on the myocardial microstructure. Significant structure-function consequences
include persistent cardiac dysfunction, fatal arrhythmias, and heart failure. Of the panoply of imaging biomarkers,
intramyocardial hemorrhage and the left ventricular ejection fraction (a marker of cardiac function) have the
strongest predictive value for poor cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure. Cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) offers high spatial resolution and is the preferred modality for the characterization of post-infarct
myocardial tissue heterogeneity. However, current CMR approaches to detect myocardial bleeding lack
sensitivity and specificity whereas methods to simultaneously detect myocardial bleeding and provide cardiac
function assessment in a single fast scan are lacking. We propose to develop a fast, free-breathing, whole-heart
cine CMR framework that employs a pure intravascular tracer to track and spatially demarcate acute myocardial
bleeding while simultaneously providing information about cardiac function. We will rigorously test our technique
in swine models and patients with hemorrhagic AMI by sampling from a large and diverse patient pool. We will
integrate high-quality, multiscale, multidimensional data to construct a patient-adaptive disease model for the
prediction of post-AMI adverse remodeling and heart failure. We expect our proposed approach to spur
therapeutic innovations for the management of hemorrhagic transformation as a complementary pathway for
mitigating downstream heart failure. Examples may include controlled reperfusion or adjunctive therapy during
interventions. Successful completion of our proposed work will shift the focus from delayed detection of
hemoglobin degradation metabolites to early simultaneous depiction of intramyocardial hemorrhage and
quantification of cardiac function. Our findings will provide a foundation for further development of a patient-
adaptive, image-guided approach based on structure-function relationships to improve heart failure outcomes."
10899602,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Affecting one third of the global population, with no pharmacotherapy available, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) has become the leading cause of chronic liver disease. Surprisingly, the major cause of death in
patients with NAFLD and the more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease (CVD). This highlights a critical need to identify targetable pathways for concurrent treatment, which has
been hampered by limited understanding of the pathophysiology and metabolic pathways linking these two
diseases. Recently, we and others uncovered oxalate metabolism commonly dysregulated in NAFLD and CVD.
While oxalate effects in the kidneys are well known, they have not been systematically studied in hepatocytes,
the primary cells responsible for its formation. Moreover, in NASH and associated atherosclerosis, a causative
role of oxalate, its underlying mechanisms and the therapeutic potential of targeting oxalate overproduction are
unknown. Using unbiased transcriptomics, we uncovered suppression of genes that limit oxalate production in
livers from humans and mice with NASH. Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT), a liver-specific enzyme
that detoxifies glyoxylate, the oxalate precursor, was reduced and oxalate was markedly increased in correlation
with NASH severity. Remarkably, oxalate was also increased both in patients and mice with atherosclerosis. In
our mouse model of hepatic oxalate overproduction (Agxt-/-), both NASH and atherosclerosis were increased
with suppressed hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) and induced proinflammatory pathways. Atherosclerosis
was enhanced also by exogenous oxalate. In hepatocytes, oxalate induced mitochondrial dysfunction and lipid
accumulation while downregulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) targets and
upregulating C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5). Importantly, limiting oxalate production via liver-specific
AGXT overexpression, as proof-of-concept, attenuated NASH and atherosclerosis, underscoring the potential of
oxalate reduction for concurrent treatment. This project will address the central hypothesis that hepatic oxalate
overproduction drives NASH and atherosclerosis via mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired PPARα/FAO, and
CCL5 induction, while suppression of oxalate formation reduces established NASH and atherosclerosis. Aim 1
will determine the mechanisms by which oxalate drives NASH and associated atherosclerosis using novel mice
with hepatic oxalate overproduction, PPARα and CCL5 deficiency, combined with dietary and pharmacological
manipulation of oxalate, mitochondrial function and PPARα, and in vitro models. Aim 2 will define oxalate
reduction as a potential therapy for NASH and associated atherosclerosis using genetic and dietary approaches
to limit hepatic oxalate formation and enhance glyoxylate detoxification in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3 will characterize
hepatic oxalate overproduction and its genetic regulation in human NASH and atherosclerosis using epigenetics,
GWAS and human liver samples. This work will delineate a newly identified metabolic pathway linking NASH
and atherosclerosis and advance translation of oxalate reduction as a concurrent treatment for these diseases."
10903830,"Currently afflicting more than 6.2 million Americans, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative
condition that results from pathological brain aging and is the most common cause of cognitive dysfunction
among older adults. The lack of comprehensive understanding regarding drivers of AD initiation and progression
represents a critical barrier to progress for the field and has contributed to the current lack of viable treatment
options. Pathogens are emerging as a potential contributor to the etiology of AD. Neurological manifestations
and AD-associated phenotypes following acute infection with a variety of pathogens have been well documented.
The long-term consequences of repeated infection are inadequately studied, though emerging epidemiological
and preclinical evidence suggests that a higher lifetime infection burden impairs cognition, especially among
organisms carrying AD genetic risk. That pathogens impact cellular metabolism may represent a key AD-related
mechanism by which infection accelerates AD progression. What remains unknown is 1) whether a higher
lifetime exposure frequency to pathogens, especially those that have limited neuronal tropism, can promote an
AD phenotype, 2) how advanced age may potentiate this risk, and 3) the extent to which altered metabolism,
due to infection, contributes to these effects. Determination of how repeated viral exposure influences AD
neuropathological development and cognitive impairment as a function of age is a critical need for the field. Our
preliminary data demonstrates that intermittent infection induces altered metabolic phenotypes in brain
microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) and correlates with reduced cognitive function. We observe significant
decreases in markers associated with mitochondrial function in infected mice. We will leverage an aging murine
model with repeated exposure to viruses, to detect changes to metabolic pathways in the blood brain barrier and
how this correlates to cognitive ability. Aim 1 will address if repeated viral exposure accelerates age-associated
mitochondrial dysfunction of cells in the blood brain barrier, contributing to AD progression. Aim 2 will define how
voltage dependent anion channel 1 mechanistically alters mitochondrial function in BMVEC with age. Aim 3,
defines how viruses impacts blood brain barrier permeability as a function of age, accelerating AD progression.
The outcome of these studies will contribute crucial understanding of how pathogen exposure influences AD
progression and cognitive function. This project could potentially revealing novel therapeutic or preventative
targets to prevent AD progression, offering hope to millions of patients and their caregivers."

 Activation of IKKbeta has been implicated in inflammation and in mouse models accelerates
tumorigenesis in the presence of an oncogene or the loss of tumor suppressor gene. Four IKKbeta inhibitors
entered clinical trials however none were FDA approved due to unfavorable safety profile, lack of efficacy or
portfolio repositioning. MAP3K1 is an upstream kinase that phosphorylates IKKb and higher MAP3K1 levels is
associated with poorer 5-year survival in pancreatic cancer patients, making it an attractive therapeutic target.
We recently reported the discovery of a MAP3K1 inhibitor (IKAM-1) that reduced p-IKKb levels, reduced tumor
growth and metastasis in Krasmutation driven pancreatic cancer. Structure-guided modification validated IKAM-1
binding mode and identified 2 as an improved inhibitor. With 12 proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs)
currently in clinical trials PROTACs are rapidly emerging as a mainstream approach in drug discovery. Synthesis
and evaluation of a focused set of PROTACs using 2 as the head group led to the identification of 50-008 that
exhibited broad anticancer activities with IC50 < 100 nM in 269 cancer cell lines. In this application we propose,
to (a) conduct RNA-seq and proteome-wide screens to elucidate the mechanism of action, (b) optimize for
efficacy through optimization of linker conformation and (c) evaluate 50-008 or an improved analog in organoids
and tumor models. These studies will identify a lead candidate with defined MOA suitable for IND enabling toxicity
studies."
10733443,"Project Summary
Insects are the primary vectors for many deadly diseases. Mosquitoes and other biting insects rely on their
exquisite sense of smell to identify and hone in on their human hosts. Consequently, one strategy to control the
transmission of insect-borne diseases is to target insect olfactory receptors, disrupt the initial detection of
human volatiles, and prevent insects from locating humans. The goal of developing potent insect repellents that
cripple host-seeking behavior is greatly facilitated by the unique molecular nature of insect olfactory receptors.
Insect olfactory receptors form a novel class of heteromeric ion channels comprised of two distinct subunits—a
highly divergent odorant receptor (OR) subunit that confers odorant specificity and a common Orco subunit,
that is virtually invariant amongst diverse insect species, reflecting its essential role in olfactory transduction.
Given the conserved and critical role that Orco plays in odor detection, it forms an ideal molecular target for a
much-needed new generation of insect repellents with the potential to halt the transmission of insect-borne
diseases. Unfortunately, as these receptors represent a unique specialization of insects and lack structural
homology to any other ion channel family, many of their most elementary structural and functional properties
have remained elusive, precluding sufficient mechanistic understanding to guide repellent design. To fill this
important void in the field, my lab recently determined the structure of an Orco homomeric channel using cryo-
electron microscopy, providing the first structural snapshot of an insect olfactory receptor. Building on this
advance and our expertise in odorant receptor biochemistry, we propose to elucidate the structure of Orco in
conditions that replicate its native environment: embedded within a lipid membrane (Aim 1) and assembled
with an OR to form a heteromeric channel (Aim 2), alone and in complex with synthetic agonists and odorants.
Revealing multiple structures of insect olfactory receptors in both apo and ligand bound states will provide
direct insight into the structural and mechanistic basis for their allosteric modulation. Together, the proposed
studies offer a unique and powerful inroad to the rational design of small-molecule repellents that disrupt odor
detection and host-seeking behavior in insect vectors of human disease."
10886832,"In 2021 alone, 25 million children globally did not receive the first dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-
containing vaccine (DTP1). The vast majority of these - live in low-income and middle-
income countries. In addition, many children received their first dose of the measles-containing vaccine
(MCV1) much later than scheduled, thus, are at significant risk of becoming infected before they are eventually
vaccinated and may contribute to suboptimal herd immunity. In The Gambia, there is a recent upsurge of
measles, with a 6-fold increase in cases as of mid-2022 compared to 2020 figures despite achieving a
minimum MCV1coverage of 90% over the last decade. Recent data suggest that a large proportion of
vaccinations are delayed or not delivered in an age-appropriate manner, according to the national vaccination
windows. In addition, untimely MCV1 and zero-dose are thought to co-exist and clustered in certain remote
communities and may contribute to suboptimal herd immunity. The PI, Dr Oghenebrume Wariri will apply novel
spatiotemporal modelling approaches to map the subpopulation with untimely measles vaccination and zero-
dose at fine-spatial scale and examine potential links with suboptimal herd immunity and risk of measles
outbreaks. He will also examine how geographic accessibility shapes the uptake and delivery of routine
vaccination in The Gambia. The project will leverage longitudinal cohort data from Health and Demographic
Surveillance Systems in The Gambia, and bio-banked serological samples covering rural populations in the
Kiang West District of The Gambia. There are four specific aims for this K43 award: 1) to determine the
spatiotemporal pattern of untimely MCV1 and zero-dose children at high-spatial resolution in The Gambia; 2) to
determine if there is a spatiotemporal relationship between cluster location of untimely MCV1 and measles
population immunity in The Gambia; 3) To investigate the contribution of geographic accessibility (between
households and vaccination posts; and between fixed and outreach vaccination posts) to zero-dose prevalence
and delayed MCV1; 4) to model geographic access to routine vaccination services to understand the utility of
the current vaccine delivery channels and potentially identify optimal locations of vaccination clinics and posts.
This K43 Award will equip Dr Wariri with novel skills and competencies in geospatial and infectious disease
modelling, manuscript and grant writing. Dr Wariri will be working with a multi-disciplinary mentoring committee
comprising internationally-recognised African, UK, and US-based experts in vaccinology, population immunity
and infectious diseases modelling, and geospatial modelling. The proposed research, in combination with a
structured mentoring and training plan that includes didactic courses and workshops, is designed to facilitate

10898803,"Leveraging multi-omics to maximize the scientific value of pediatric sepsis biorepository and advance patient endotyping.
PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Sepsis is major pediatric health problem and kills more children than cancer in the U.S each year. Primarily
driven by a dysfunctional host response to an infection, a subset of patients with persistent or progressive
multiple organ dysfunctions disproportionately contribute to sepsis morbidity and mortality. Yet, there are no
disease modifying therapies currently available beyond early antibiotics and organ support. Biological
heterogeneity among patients has significantly impeded scientific progress and advances in patient care.
Although precision medicine approaches have been used to begin to sift through patient-level differences, we
fundamentally lack a comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms. Thus, there is a crucial need to
maximize the use of existing pediatric sepsis biorepositories to unravel causal pathways, facilitate rapid
identification of biologically relevant patient subclasses more likely to benefit from targeted therapies.
 To bridge this gap, we seek to utilize state-of-the-art multi-omics approaches to explore the scientific value
of our vast collection of biospecimens from critically ill children with sepsis. While gene-expression profiling has
been used to identify biologically relevant endotypes, it is increasingly evident that interrogation of single layer
of molecular data is likely insufficient. Recent studies suggest that the epigenomic changes, including
differential DNA methylation at CpG islands, closely regulate gene-expression in human sepsis. Through this
phased innovation award, we seek to determine whether integrated analyses of methylomic and transcriptomic
datasets at scale can provide a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and inform patient endotyping.
We further seek to determine whether clinical data linked with patient biospecimens can be used to predict
endotype membership, with operational implications for predictive enrichment in future clinical trials.
 Milestone-driven developmental activities in the R21 phase will focus on stringent quality control of DNA
and RNA samples within our biorepository to determine suitability for high throughput methods. We will then
generate pilot DNA methylation profiling and RNA sequencing data for study planning and to demonstrate
feasibility of integrated analyses. In the R33 phase, we will scale efforts to generate robust methylomic and
transcriptomic datasets. We will leverage the bioinformatic capabilities of the investigator team to derive and
validate novel multi-omic endotypes and determine their clinical significance. Finally, we will develop a
classifier model to predict endotype membership using clinical data within the derivation cohort and test its
generalizability in a large electronic health record-based dataset of >15,000 critically ill children with sepsis and
multiple organ dysfunctions. Through the successful execution of this proposal, we seek to generate a rich
dataset to drive future mechanistic research in human sepsis and develop an actionable framework for rapid
and equitable identification of pediatric sepsis subclasses who may benefit from targeted sepsis therapeutics."
10899645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Birth Defects Research Laboratory (BDRL) is the only NIH-funded fetal tissue repository available to
scientific recipients in the US. HFT is irreplaceable for biomedical research because animal and cellular
models of human development and disease do not fully match or recapitulate human development and
disease. Also, differences in brain and other organs in development have been identified between humans and
animal models. Animal and cellular models may not contain the full mixture of cell types or fully mimic
tissue/organ structure. Engineered mutations in developmental genes maybe embryonically lethal in model
organisms rendering such genes intractable to study by this approach. Creation of humanized mice to model
human infectious, immunological and neoplastic diseases requires xenografting of HFT. Comparison between
model systems and native human tissue including HFT is required to ensure that conclusions based on model
systems are applicable to human biology and medicine. Further, human-specific genes cannot be studied in
model organisms and adult-stem cells cannot be used to study all disorders, especially those that have a base
in prenatal development. The BDRL is therefore a crucial scientific resource to retain for facilitating biomedical
research progress, especially since alternative commercial laboratories maybe embroiled in controversy
related to accusations of trade in HFT. The near 60-year track record and success of the BDRL has been
proven many times over from consistent provision of recipient-related scientific services with HFT, fully
compliant with strict ethical and research guidelines, without transgression. Spectacular technological
advances in biology, notably -omics have greatly expanded research opportunities for utilizing HFT to facilitate
novel insights. These advances confirm the rationale for the laboratory to continue to innovate and undertake
collaborations to evaluate and synergistically demonstrate novel experimental approaches to maximize the
scientific utility of HFT. This application seeks to develop the resource beyond the core fundamental goal of the
systematic collection and processing of fetal specimens for distribution of HFT and biologics to recipients. We
propose to further develop the research resource by continuing to engage with collaborators to synergistically
develop their research and develop our expertise and services. Concurrently, this serves to promote
awareness of the laboratory to increase recipient recruitment, as well as enhance research progress into the
bases of human development and disease."

The tribally led Knowledge Warding Against Toxin Levels Center for Oceans and Human Health will be
directed by a Tribal government’s Resource Protection Division Director and Co-Directed by a public health
academic. The purpose of the Center will be to address key unknowns surrounding paralytic shellfish
poisoning (PSP), which the Fourth National Climate Assessment called a “public health emergency” (page
1203). This will be done by using a mixed-methods approach overall, with proven laboratory-based techniques
(RBA and HPLC) to assess toxin levels in shellfish from coastal communities around Alaska, complemented by
interviews and surveys of residents of Gulf of Alaska communities that have reported at least some PSP
burden. The Center will have 3 Cores: Administrative Core, Facility Service Core, and Community Engagement
Core. The Administrative Core will be run by the government of Sitka Tribe of Alaska, a federally recognized
tribe. Its purpose will be to provide oversight, guidance, and direction to all Projects and other Cores. The
Facility Service Core will be run by the Sitka Tribe of Alaska Environmental Research Lab, to provide a
centralized location for the processing of all shellfish samples that will produce useful data for the Projects and
community. The Community Engagement Core will be run by the Kodiak Area Native Association (KANA), a
501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and Tribal Organization and facilitate community engagement activities. The
Center will conduct 3 projects: Project 1 will assess the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise on
shellfish toxin exposure using multiple approaches including model-based forecasting and laboratory-based
experiments; Project 2 will evaluate the toxicity of specific toxin congeners occurring as mixtures in shellfish;
and Project 3 will characterize community views and dietary practices and clarify the burden of PSP disease

Cochlear implants (CIs) are an effective treatment for adults with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss,
and ideally lead to improved real-world communication skills and social engagement. However, we currently do
not have a good understanding of relevant, modifiable factors that contribute to the enormous variability in
communication outcomes observed in both new and experienced CI users. Further, the current method by which
we quantify CI outcomes, via clinical measures of speech recognition, tells us little about the real-world
functioning of our CI patients. Our long-term goal is to better understand real-world communication, learning,
and adaptation in adult CI users, and the sensory and cognitive-linguistic processes that support
maximizing real-world CI benefits, in order to identify future targets for rehabilitative efforts. New CI users
largely learn to adapt to their CIs through their everyday experiences. Differences in the real-world auditory-
social experience of new CI users likely contribute to communication outcomes, but currently our knowledge of
how real-world experience promotes adaptation in adult CI users is limited. Further, the extent to which auditory-
social experience changes following implantation remains unclear. Therefore, the overall objectives of the
proposed research are to determine how diverse auditory-social experience facilitates speech recognition
abilities in new CI users, and to characterize changes in their auditory-social experience, using a multi-
disciplinary approach. Here, we focus on the amount and variability of new CI users’ speech input (“speech input
attributes”), through assessment of their social networks and communication practices. Our central hypothesis
is that speech input variability experienced in the real-world auditory-social environment promotes robust speech
recognition abilities in new CI users, and that access to diverse real-world auditory-social experience expands
as a benefit of implantation. Our hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will determine the
contribution of speech input attributes experienced in the real-world auditory-social environment to robust speech
recognition abilities in new CI users. We will assess the association between new CI users’ experience of
speech input variability and amount and speech recognition abilities in challenging conditions, pre-
operatively and over 6 months of CI use. Aim 2 will investigate changes in the real-world auditory-social
experience of new CI users following implantation, and the moderating role of robust communication skills. We
will compare speech input attributes pre-operatively and at 6 months of CI use, and evaluate the relation
between changes and speech comprehension ability. The proposed research will lead to a better understanding
of modifiable factors (i.e. auditory-social environments) that best support adaptation and will help to define real-
world social engagement benefits of implantation. Findings will provide a scientific basis for the development of
new rehabilitation protocols and clinical assessment tools to optimize real-world outcomes in CI patients."

This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun
Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr.
Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read-
based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of
new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another
essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be
pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work
will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology.
Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in
human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and
short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary
mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW).
The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using
high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic
data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through
activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored
training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model
organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies.
While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and
thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and
deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants
to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single-
nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE
of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage
human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using
contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on
diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this
proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in
new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the
candidate’s future independent laboratory."
10930894,"SUMMARY
Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common solid tumors in children and the leading
cause of childhood-cancer-related deaths. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic treatments.
One such advancement is carbon-ion radiation therapy (CIRT). Yet, despite treating 20,000 patients over 2
decades, there is a significant reluctance to use this modality to treat pediatric brain tumors because of a fear
that normal tissue would be irreparably harmed. This fear is a consequence of the many questions that are
unanswered regarding the ability to quantify the relative biologic effectiveness (RBE) of CIRT. An important
attribute of the physical dose delivered by charged particles is ionization density, which varies with particle charge
and velocity. Ionization density is frequently described in terms of linear energy transfer (LET), defined as the
mean energy lost 𝑑𝐸∆/𝑑𝑙 by a charged particle per unit distance 𝑑𝑙 traversed due to interactions with electrons
in matter. For charged particles, the dose and LET increase dramatically over the terminal few millimeters of the
pristine Bragg peak as the particle halts. A major uncertainty is the scaling from dose and LET to biological effect,
which varies within tumors and normal tissues in a complex manner. The computational dose and RBE models
simulate on a millimeter-scale the variation of dose, energy and LET spectra, and particle fragment spectra within
the patient anatomy and link these physical properties to biologic data, often determined from in vitro clonogenic
survival assays. A critical gap in knowledge is the true in vivo tissue response to high-LET radiation in clinically
relevant biological assays. The uncertainty is enormous and the impact of incorrect assignment of an RBE value
to a given voxel can be catastrophic in clinical practice. Therefore, RBE values need to be determined with the
greatest possible accuracy. Our central hypothesis is that optimization of carbon-ion radiation therapy will
allow for improved curative outcomes for pediatric brain tumors, with equivalent or lower neurologic
toxicity compared to x-ray therapy. Two specific aims will be used to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 will
systematically quantify the RBE of CIRT normal-tissue toxicity in a rodent model of pediatric brain, for various
functional and pathologic endpoints, at variable dose and LET, compared to x-ray therapy. Aim 2 will test the
working hypothesis that high-LET carbon ions are more effective in controlling pediatric high-grade glioma than
conventional radiation. Thus, the overall objective of this work is to investigate the normal brain toxicity, cognitive
side effects, second cancer risks, and anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical models relevant for pediatric patients,
providing a sound foundation for advancing this modality into clinical practice. We will answer the question as to
whether carbon-ion therapy, which shows immense potential for historically radioresistant cancers, can be
expected to improve the therapeutic window for pediatric high-grade glioma patients. Furthermore, we will
contribute fundamental new knowledge regarding treatment risks and neurotoxic side effects relevant for all
pediatric CNS tumors treated with radiation."
10931743,"Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, bears the second highest burden of cancer cases (11%) and deaths

Center for Research on Implementation Science and Equity (C3-RISE) capacity building core. The overall
goals are to increase the pipeline of early-career Nigerian-based investigators and practitioners who can lead
IS research for equitable cancer control in Nigeria. We will use participatory implementation science
approaches10 (such as crowdsourcing11 and apprenticeships) to develop sustained capacity for implementation
research at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Crowdsourcing asks a group to solve a problem
(through participatory activities such as open calls,12 designathons,13 or other activities) and then shares the
solutions with the public.14 Apprenticeships provide the practical skills, direct mentorship, and supportive
environment to increase the likelihood of launching successful IS interventions. In this capacity building core,
we propose a series of in-person and online training opportunities in IS methods to spur innovative, equitable
cancer control research pilot studies. Each year, open calls will be used to identify eight exceptional trainees
(as part of two-person teams) from participating Nigerian-based institutions (including academic, clinical, and
community-based organizations). Each cohort will join a two-week residential training experience focused on
IS for equitable cancer control. Trainees will also become part of a year-long virtual learning community and
mentoring program designed to facilitate and sustain careers in the IS and cancer workforces. Trainee teams
will compete for small seed Pilot Partner grants to launch pilot plans of their final IS cancer pilots at community
sites. They will receive mentorship from established faculty mentors to carry out pilots focused on enhancing
vaccines to prevent cancer (i.e., HPV and HBV vaccines). Our specific aims are: To identify and recruit
Nigerian trainees for the C3-RISE capacity building core ; 2) To develop IS research capacity building for equity
in cancer control among trainees; and 3) To initiate, sustain, and evaluate a virtual participatory learning
community to facilitate access to curated resources and collaboration between geographically dispersed
trainees. Our strong focus on cultivating local Nigerian mentors and trainees will have an enduring impact on
institutionalizing research mentorship and enhancing capacity for training at the organizational level. Our plan
aligns with Nigerian national, NIH, and strategic priorities related to building capacity for cancer research."
10931747,"1 Nigerians make up a significant proportion of individuals in Africa dying from human papillomavirus-(HPV)
 2 associated cancers. However, they do not access essential cancer prevention services such as evidence-
 3 based HPV vaccination to prevent cancer. This is partly explained by barriers that are individual (low
 4 awareness), social (insufficient social support), and structural (poor access to vaccines). Implementation of
 5 HPV vaccine programs can mitigate some of these barriers by decentralizing vaccine access to reduce the
 6 incidence and death rate of HPV-associated cancers. We propose to expand youth-friendly HPV vaccines,
 7 informed by a youth participatory action research framework (YPAR), the PEN-3 cultural model, and the
 8 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science (CFIR). Unlike projects targeting youth as passive
 9 recipients, the YPAR considers youth to be partners in creating and leading solutions to problems that affect
10 them. PEN-3 cultural model leverages local resources and partnerships from an equity mindset to improve
11 health, while CFIR enables an evaluation of the barriers and facilitators of implementation effectiveness. The
12 proposed Innovative Tools to Expand youth-friendly Services and Translation of HPV services (I-TEST HPV)
13 will draw on two participatory methods, crowdsourcing (i.e., open calls and designathons) and apprenticeships,
14 to increase HPV vaccine uptake among girls aged 9-15 years old per national guidelines. We hypothesize that
15 these two approaches (open challenges and apprenticeships) will increase the uptake of HPV vaccine
16 campaigns in Nigeria. Using a hybrid type II effectiveness implementation design to simultaneously assess
17 both clinical and implementation outcomes, our aims are: 1) To use participatory approaches (crowdsourcing
18 and apprenticeships) to develop new HPV vaccine campaigns; 2) To determine whether the final
19 crowdsourced campaign increases HPV vaccination uptake among girls aged 9-15 years, and evaluate
20 intervention sustainment, one-year post implementation. We will recruit 1,120 girls from 32 communities to a
21 stepped-wedge randomized control trial of the finalist campaign versus usual care. A total of sixty-four trained
22 youth research facilitators from each setting (2 per setting) will implement the final HPV vaccination campaign.
23 The primary outcome is the initial HPV dose vaccine uptake among girls ascertained by vaccination records at
24 community clinics. The secondary outcomes include the second vaccine dose, percent sustainment of core
25 program elements with sustained benefits (uptake of HPV vaccines), and sustained capacity at participating
26 communities at one year after the trial; and 3) To use mixed-methods to explore multilevel factors that
27 influence the uptake of the HPV campaigns. This research aligns with the RFA-CA-11-019 request for research

Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious public health challenges of our time. In this proposal, we focus
on two common antibiotic resistance mechanisms that are: (i) alteration of drug target enzymes and (ii)
modification of antibiotic molecules. Despite recent advances in biological sciences, clinically accessible
antibiotics can still target only a handful of enzymes, such as DNA gyrases and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
Hence, it is important to better understand molecular evolution of these enzymes and accordingly develop
effective drugs that target these enzymes without exacerbating the resistance problem. Similarly, modification of
-lactam antibiotics through hydrolysis by -lactamases is currently the most concerning antibiotic resistance
mechanism because -lactams account for nearly seventy percent of antibiotics currently used in clinics. To
address this important health problem, we propose an innovative research plan to study evolution of the DHFR
enzyme, and develop mutant-specific competitive and allosteric DHFR inhibitors to select against resistance-
conferring DHFR mutations. Finally, to address the -lactam resistance problem, we will engineer a novel class
of molecules that we named “-lactamase traps” (or BLTs) to select against -lactamase producing bacteria.
Our first aim is to map epistatic interactions that shape DHFR evolution under antibiotic selection. DHFR is a
ubiquitous enzyme with a central role in metabolism. We have previously shown that E. coli DHFR accumulates
3 to 5 resistance conferring mutations following a quasi-deterministic order, as a result of strong epistatic
interactions between DHFR mutations. We will quantitatively map all epistatic interactions in the DHFR fitness
landscape by using state-of-the-art genetic tools and the Hierarchical Model, a mathematical toolbox we
developed to efficiently explore the fitness space and identify epistatic interactions between mutations. Our
second goal is to engineer competitive and allosteric mutant-specific DHFR inhibitors. We have previously
developed an L28R-specific competitive trimethoprim derivative (4’-dTMP) that impeded evolution of resistance
by selecting against the L28R mutation. Following a similar procedure, we will engineer new competitive DHFR
inhibitors that will target resistance-conferring mutations on the D27, W30, I94, and F153 residues. Similarly, we
will identify allosteric inhibitors that can target a druggable DHFR cryptic site we discovered. This site has limited
drug accessibility for the wild-type DHFR but always remains open for the D27E, I94L, and F153S variants of
DHFR. We already showed that proglumetacin, a commonly used NSAID drug, allosterically slows down DHFR
activity. Our third goal is to engineer a novel class of molecules that select against -lactamase genes. We will
develop a novel class of molecules that we call BLTs to eliminate -lactamase producing Gram-negative bacteria.
BLT molecules are inactive in their native form but once activated by -lactamases, turn into potent antibiotics.
We have already designed and synthesized a cephalosporin-based BLT molecule that is activated by the
CTX-M cephalosporinase. We will generate a library of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-based BLT molecules."

Antibiotic resistance is one of the most serious public health challenges of our time. In this proposal, we focus
on two common antibiotic resistance mechanisms that are: (i) alteration of drug target enzymes and (ii)
modification of antibiotic molecules. Despite recent advances in biological sciences, clinically accessible
antibiotics can still target only a handful of enzymes, such as DNA gyrases and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR).
Hence, it is important to better understand molecular evolution of these enzymes and accordingly develop
effective drugs that target these enzymes without exacerbating the resistance problem. Similarly, modification of

10886136,"Cellular stress, DNA damage, pathogen insult, and immune mechanisms can activate molecular pathways that
result in regulated cell death. Increasing our understanding of the pathways that regulate cell death decisions
in response to cellular stress is critical as misregulated cell death is linked to cancer, neurodegeneration and
autoimmune diseases. The epidermis is the first line of defense to cutaneous microbes, viruses and
environmental insults, and keratinocytes play a critical role in the host innate immune response mediated by
type I interferons (IFN-I). In addition to anti-microbial and anti-viral responses this same IFN-I response also
mediates diverse cellular and biological responses such as proliferation, apoptosis, senescence and the DNA
damage response. Recent data from out laboratory suggest that the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β
(C/EBPβ) transcription factor is a novel regulator the keratinocyte type IFN-I response. We observed the
conditional deletion of C/EBPβ in mouse epidermis (CKOβ) resulted in increased expression of IFNb and
numerous ISGs which included cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (cPRRs). cPRRs sense viral/pathogen
RNA and DNA as well as damaged host cytosolic DNA and RNA to trigger a IFN-I response. CKOβ
keratinocytes treated with direct activators of cytosolic PRRs displayed a greatly increased IFN-I response that
surprisingly resulted in increased apoptosis via the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. As breifly
mentioned, DNA damage can activate the innate immune response. DNA damaging agents can result in
modifications and structural changes in RNA and DNA that could potentially be sensed by cytosolic PRRs. We
observed that CKOβ keratinocytes challenged with DNA damage displayed increase caspase 8-mediated
apoptosis that was dependent on the interferon a/b receptor (INFAR). Activation of a type IFN-I response can
result in the increased expression of ISGs with apoptotic functions that activate caspase-8 mediated apoptosis
via death receptor signaling. The objective of this proposal is to understand molecular basis for how C/EBPβ
negatively regulates the IFN-I response and caspase-8 mediated apoptosis in response to direct activators of
cytosolic PRRs and DNA damage in vivo in mouse epidermis and in primary keratinocytes. We hypothesize
that C/EBPβ negatively regulates the IFN-I response in keratinocytes and the loss of C/EBPβ sensitizes
keratinocytes to the direct activation of cytosolic PRRs by pathogen RNA/DNA or damaged host RNA/DNA to
induce pro-apoptotic ISGs and caspase 8-mediated apoptosis. These experiments will increase our
understanding of a novel pathway by which C/EBPβ regulates activation of cPRRs and the IFN-I response to
control cell death decisions in response to cellular stress including DNA damage. This increased
understanding could identify new therapeutic targets to restore proper regulation of cell death to treat skin
cancer, skin infectious diseases, and skin autoimmune diseases."

Solid organ transplant recipients exhibiting HLA donor specific antibodies (DSA) are at risk for graft loss due to
chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR) and develop a progressive vascular disease known as transplant
vasculopathy (TV). Although cAMR and TV are highly significant clinical problems across different solid organ
transplants the mechanisms by which DSAs directed against HLA I and HLA II contribute to cAMR and TV are
not yet understood. Novel mechanistic targets and therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat cAMR and TV
are urgently needed. Previously, we demonstrated that DSA-induced ligation of HLA molecules expressed in the
surface of endothelial cells (ECs) induces signaling pathways that regulate survival, proliferation and migration,
all of which are highly relevant to TV. However, the key transcriptional programs stimulated by ligation of HLA
molecules remain to be identified. This gap in understanding hinders effective therapeutic targeting of DSA
effector functions to prevent cAMR and TV. Based on our new results, we posit that the transcriptional co-
activator Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) and its paralog WW-domain-containing Transcriptional co-Activator with
PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), two central effectors of the Hippo pathway, are downstream points of convergence
and integration in the mitogenic and migratory signaling initiated by DSAs in ECs. Although inhibition of the
activity of transcription factors or their co-activators is a challenging strategy, recent evidence suggests a new
avenue to target YAP/TAZ activity via drugs of the statin family. Importantly, epidemiological studies indicate
that statins exert a beneficial effect in clinical transplant populations. Based on substantial preliminary studies,
the central hypothesis of this proposal is that YAP and its paralog TAZ play a crucial role in promoting the
proliferation and migration of ECs in response to DSAs and that the FDA-approved drugs of the statin family
inhibit YAP/TAZ function in these cells. A fundamental translational implication of our hypothesis is that the drugs
of the statin family can be an important element in preventing cAMR by blocking growth-promoting YAP/TAZ
signaling in ECs. We propose to explore this central hypothesis by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1) Determine
the regulation and function of YAP in human ECs stimulated with antibodies directed against HLA I or HLA II:
role of Src kinases. 2) Define the mechanism(s) by which statins inhibit YAP function, proliferation and migration
of ECs stimulated with antibodies directed against HLA I or HLA II. 3) Characterize the impact of statins on YAP
and cAMR in vivo using a novel model of heart graft allograft that develop TV. We propose that the Src/YAP/TAZ
axis plays a critical role in antibody-mediated EC proliferation and that statins inhibit EC proliferation and TV via
YAP/TAZ inhibition. We anticipate that the Src/YAP/TAZ axis will emerge as a novel target in cAMR thus
propelling further studies to reposition FDA-approved statins either singly or in combination with Src inhibitors
for preventing chronic allograft injury induced by DSAs."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) increases the risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI), because the physical assaults
target the head, neck, and face. Women, more than men, across socioeconomic, racial, educational, regional,
and other demographic variables are in harm’s way throughout their life and particularly during pregnancy. When
one partner is pregnant, the frequency and intensity of physical assaults increase and remain focused on the
head, neck, and face. But, the consequences of a TBI during pregnancy (gravida TBI; gTBI) on offspring neuro-
development are unknown. Isolated TBI elevates stress and inflammation, which are known to divert fetal neuro-
development with gestational exposure. The proposal goal is to provide proof-of-concept that gTBI can disturb
neurodevelopment, thereby establishing gTBI as an environmental risk factor for developmental disorders.
These studies cannot be performed in people or be derived from existing databases, thereby warranting
laboratory studies. Preliminary data from this research team showed live births, low male weaning weight,
distorted cortical circuity, reduced anxiety and depression, and a muted immune response principally in male
gTBI offspring. These results encourage further investigation of TBI timing with respect to pregnancy, broader
assessment of neuropsychiatric outcomes, enhanced neural circuit analyses, and molecular investigations of
cell and synaptic change. The extent of neurodevelopment disruption is compared to a standard model of
maternal immune activation (MIA) and respective controls. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that TBI
during pregnancy leads to disrupted neurodevelopmental trajectory in the offspring that includes altered
neurobehavioral performance, neurocircuit organization, and cell type-specific molecular disturbances.
To test this hypothesis, a diffuse TBI will be delivered to timed-pregnant mice at 5 and 12 days post-coitum and
then follow male and female offspring in terms of: [Aim 1] birth outcomes, offspring physiology, neurobehavioral
phenotype; [Aim 2] neurocircuitry phenotype, and [Aim 3] synaptic protein expression and cortical cell type-
specific gene expression (transcriptomics). Aim 1 will evaluate early post-natal behaviors; cognition, anxiety,
depressive-like, and sensorimotor gating in young adult; and social behaviors in adult offspring. In Aim 2, cortical
and hippocampal synaptic physiology and cortical connectivity will be evaluated by electrophysiology and laser
scanning photostimulation, and aligned with quantitative neuronal morphology. In Aim 3, western blot
quantification of synaptic proteins and cell type-specific transcriptomics inform circuit development and molecular
trajectories. Impact: Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide the first proof-of-concept that
consequences of TBI during pregnancy, often resulting from IPV, can distort developing brain circuity and
determine a neurodevelopmental disorder behavioral phenotype."
10894070,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Shared decision-making (SDM) is an active process of clinician and patient interaction that is intended to
produce a joint decision. Critical to the implementation of SDM and the evaluation of its effect on health
outcomes is the availability of valid and reliable instruments to measure SDM. Though several instruments
have been designed to measure the process of arriving at a shared decision in the clinical encounter, few have
been deemed high quality and none have been specifically designed to measure the process of SDM in
pediatrics. Furthermore, most instruments measure the SDM process from a singular perspective (e.g., patient
self-report or observer) despite increasing recognition that clinician perspectives are also needed to accurately
capture the dyadic interaction and inherently bidirectional process of SDM.
 The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a dyadic instrument to measure the process of
SDM with parents of young children that includes both parent and clinician perspectives. We will anchor the
development of this instrument to a 4-step process for implementing SDM in pediatrics that we developed and
validated in preliminary work using a diverse set of decision-making scenarios across multiple pediatric
disciplines and varied clinical settings. The first 3 steps of this process involve recognition of [>1] medically
reasonable option (Step 1); clinician assessment of the medical benefit-burden ratios of options (Step 2); and
parent expression of preferences regarding options (Step 3). Step 4 encourages a parent- or clinician-guided
SDM based on Steps 1-3 that can be further modified based on the presence of other decisional features.
 Our specific aims are to (1) develop a dyadic instrument for measuring the SDM process with parents
of young children using a standard, iterative process that includes item generation, augmentation of the item
pool, item reduction through expert review, and pretesting with parents and clinicians, with a sub-aim to
develop an observer-coded version of the instrument to explore its correlation with the final dyadic instrument
in Aim 3; (2) assess the [internal consistency], construct validity and reliability of the preliminary dyadic
instrument in a controlled, simulated setting by conducting an online experiment in which [parent (N=600)
and clinician (N=600) participants] complete our preliminary dyadic instrument after being randomized to view
one of 4 different pairs of standardized video vignettes that portray a high-quality and low-quality SDM
encounter of a unique decision in pediatrics; and (3) evaluate the construct validity and feasibility of the
final dyadic instrument in the clinical setting by administering the instrument to parent and clinician
participants after [problem-based encounters (N=127)] across a range of pediatric settings and specialties at
two pediatric institutions, [with a sub-aim to develop a Spanish version of the final dyadic instrument.]
 This R01 application will yield a valid and reliable instrument to feasibly measure the process of SDM with
parents of young children and will enable follow-on evaluation of SDM on child health outcomes."

 Innate behaviors, also known as instincts, are essential for the survival of all species in the animal kingdom,
including humans. Of great interest is understanding how the experience-induced behavioral plasticity observed
in innate behaviors can lead to maladaptive behavioral expressions, including uncontrolled aggression, sex
offenses, and generalized anxiety. Such mental disorders carry a substantial emotional and financial burden to
families and society, rendering the development of effective therapeutic approaches of high significance.
 The neural substrates of innate behaviors are distributed across numerous brain regions. An essential step
towards understanding how the brain orchestrates behavior is to identify how inter-region interactions of neural
activity influence behavior in freely moving animals. However, methodological limitations have largely restricted
such investigations to single nuclei, while the deep brain remains to date inaccessible to in vivo mesoscale neural
recordings in freely moving animals. The research proposed here uses custom-designed technology to break
this methodological barrier, making possible recordings with single-unit resolution across twenty subregions of
the deep brain (hypothalamus) in freely moving, innate behavior-expressing mice.
 In Aim 1, using this technology, I will investigate the presence of behavior-specific mesoscale hypothalamic
neural features in the innate and learned expressions of social and fear-related behaviors. I will test whether the
activity of specific brain regions can predict specific behaviors, and I will identify the spatial distribution of
hypothalamic clusters exhibiting behavior-tuning or mixed selectivity. In Aim 2, I will dissect how aggression- or
fear-conditioning alters mesoscale neural activity dynamics and test the effect of chronic administration of
pharmacological reagents known to reduce the expression of maladaptive social and fear behaviors. Lastly, in
Aim 3 – the independent phase of the award, I will expand the use of these tools to investigate mesoscale neural
activity dynamics across diverse areas of the corticolimbic system, seeking to identify local and global principles
that guide the expression of the physiological and maladaptive forms of innate behaviors.
 Collectively, the above approaches target the development of an experimental and analytical platform to
address fundamental questions of systems neuroscience on the mesoscale mechanisms that govern the
expression of innate behaviors. Following these initial steps, this work will be complemented by experimentation
aiming to test whether the identified neural features in the behaviors of interest have a causal role.
 Through the mentored phase of this award, my vision is to build a highly complementary skillset to the one I
acquired during my graduate training, and create a unique, state-of-the-art independent research program. By
pursuing work spanning diverse disciplines, including molecular, cellular, systems neuroscience, behavioral and
computational approaches, I am committed to developing a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of
innate behaviors, with the potential to lead to advanced therapeutic solutions."
10878906,"Cannabis use during pregnancy has increased substantially, in conjunction with widespread
decriminalization/legalization, changing public perceptions about harm, and evidence of cannabis's antiemetic
properties. Prior outcomes research on prenatal cannabis exposure is narrow in scope, as these older studies
included research participants with polysubstance use (e.g., tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs). In addition, prior
research also likely underestimated potential risks specific to cannabis use during pregnancy because modern
strains are 10x more potent than they were 40 years ago. We propose to study neurodevelopment in infants
exposed in utero to cannabis using state-of-the-art MRI and behavioral measures. Maternal cannabis use will
be measured prospectively using weekly reports validated with labels and urine-based assays. By focusing on
infancy, we aim to characterize cannabis-induced brain changes at a time when environmental effects are
minimized and are less influential than at older. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that prenatal cannabis
exposure is more detrimental to male than females. To test our hypotheses, we will recruit 200 pregnant
people (where the mother uses cannabis, but not other drugs, tobacco, or alcohol) and 170 pregnant control
participants matched on education level. Infants will receive a neonatal neurobehavioral exam and multi-modal
imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI) under natural
sleep at 2-4 weeks-of-age and extensive neuropsychological follow-up assessments at 6 and 18 months. This
program of research aims to clarify potential health risks, enabling pregnant people to make better-informed
choices surrounding cannabis use during pregnancy."

Vaccination of Rhesus macaques (RMs) with SIV insert-expressing 68-1 Rhesus Cytomegalovirus vectors
(RhCMV/SIV) elicits an immune response that in 59% of vaccinees can intercept and effectively arrest an early
spreading primary SIV infection. The vast majority of vaccinated RM that manifest SIV replication arrest go to
completely clear SIV infection, a remarkable outcome with enormous potential clinical significance. This unique
pattern of “arrest and clear” efficacy has been linked to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-E-restricted SIV-
specific CD8+ T cell responses and in RMs with MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses, a protection-predictive
innate immune transcriptional response to vaccination in whole blood (the whole blood protection-predictive
signature or wbPPTS) that includes a central IL-15 signaling component. RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RM destined
for arrest and clear efficacy manifest low baseline IL-15 signaling (IL-15 quiescence) and high post vaccination
IL-15 signaling which persists through to SIV challenge. Since IL-15 is the major cytokine regulator of effector
memory T cell physiology, including regulation of effector function, activation thresholds, population
homeostasis, and homing behavior, these observations that correlation between the magnitude and persistence
of IL-15 signaling induction and protection might reflect an IL-15-mediated modulation of the SIV-specific MHC-
E-restricted CD8+ T cells, but IL-15 is not the only pathway in the wbPPTS and its unclear whether IL-15 or other
components of the wbPPTS contribute to the tissue-based immune programming that enables vaccine efficacy.
In this project, we seek to delineate the origin and tissue correlates of the wbPPTS and its IL-15 dependence in
order the delineate the fundamental components of vaccine-induced innate immune programming required for
efficacy. We will achieve this goal by determining 1) the systemic transcriptomic correlates of the RhCMV/SIV
vaccine-induced wbPPTS in peripheral and mucosal lymphoid tissues and its dependence on IL-15 signaling
(S.A.1), 2) the specific spatial transcriptomic response to RhCMV/SIV-infected cells in tissues and the direct
contribution of vector-infected cells to the local and systemic transcriptomic responses linked to wbPPTS
programming (S.A.2), and 3) the mechanisms underlying the association between IL-15 signaling quiescence
and generation of the wbPPTS (S.A.3). We expect these data to implicate an underlying immune mechanism for
RhCMV/SIV vaccine-induced arrest and clear protection, to provide validated tissue-based immune correlates
for clinical translation, and, potentially, to lead to vaccine modifications that would increase the efficacy of CMV-
based SIV/HIV vaccines."

10870172,"The invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKT cells) comprise a well-defined subset of unconventional, innate-like
lymphocytes that are important effector and regulatory cells in both humans and mouse models. Unlike
conventional T cells, iNKT cells express T cell antigen receptors of limited diversity and respond mainly to
foreign and self-glycolipid antigens presented by the MHC class I-like CD1d protein. Activities of iNKT cells
include tumor immunosurveillance and induction of tumor regression, strongly implying the potential for
iNKT cell-directed therapies for cancer. Synthetic glycolipid antigens that potently activate iNKT cells, such
as synthetic α-galactosyl ceramides, have attracted considerable attention as potential anti-tumor agents.
However, progress in development of effective iNKT cell directed therapies has been hindered by issues
related to toxicities and off-target effects, and is complicated by the fact that glycolipids are taken up and
presented by a variety of different cell types to generate complex and unpredictable outcomes.
Furthermore, the development of long-term unresponsiveness (anergy) and depletion of iNKT cells by
multiple exposures to strong activators like α-galactosyl ceramides makes repeated administration
ineffective. Approaches to activating iNKT cells that circumvent these obstacles are needed to exploit the
potential of these cells for cancer immunotherapy. The goal of the current proposal is to address these key
issues and accelerate the movement of iNKT cell-directed immunotherapy for cancer towards clinical
translation. Three specific aims are proposed that will build on our extensive background work that has
identified covalently stabilized soluble αGalCer-CD1d conjugates as iNKT cell activators for generating
targeted anti-tumor effects without causing iNKT cell anergy or off target toxicity. This approach will be
combined with other modalities to improve the anti-tumor effects of iNKT cell activators, including the
incorporation of costimulatory signals and combination with inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade. An
extensive body of preliminary work supports our approaches, which will be tested in vivo in relevant mouse
models of cancer. The project will benefit enormously from close interactive working relationships with a
superb group of collaborators with expertise in synthetic chemistry, protein engineering and the biology of
immune checkpoint molecules. The current proposal has direct relevance for clinical translation of basic
iNKT cell biology into immunotherapeutics, and will accelerate development of iNKT cell directed therapies
for cancers that are unresponsive to currently available treatment."

The ability to probe the temporal profile of the protein secretion behavior of individual immune cells will impact
future immunology, cell biology, and even infectious disease diagnosis. Knowledge of the ordering and timing of
cytokines (water-soluble proteins essential for intercellular signaling) secreted by activated T cells can
additionally provide the means to discriminate subsets of differentiated T cells by function. Here, the temporal
information is one of the pieces of the whole puzzle in monitoring the behavior of the immune system. The other
critical piece is the cytokine-mediated interplay between different cell types, which involves spatial transport of
cytokines between cells. Putting both pieces of the puzzle together allows us to capture the full picture of the
cytokine release dynamics and cytokine-mediated interactions of cells, which allows us to fully understand the
intercellular signaling processes underlying immunity. However, no study has yet obtained such a picture due to
the lack of a technology for real-time sensing of intercellular cytokine-mediated signaling processes at high
spatial resolution. This research aims to develop a novel label-free imaging technique to fully understand cellular
behaviors during cytokine-mediated activation and communication at a single-cell level. Our approach will
employ biosensors consisting of plasmonic nanoantenna structures, each specifically targeting a particular
cytokine species. We will integrate these biosensors in a microfluidic system incorporating an array of
sample/reagent-flow channels and single-cell trapping microwells. The microfluidic sensor integration will provide
the ability to capture, manipulate, and activate single cells for cell-to-cell communications on a single chip and
to obtain the spatiotemporal profile of cellular cytokine secretion processes in real time, both in a massively,
parallel manner. We will also develop a theoretical algorithm that allows us to extract the quantitative values of
the local cytokine concentration distributions from measured image intensities. SA 1: We will create highly
ordered, high-density plasmonic nanoantenna biosensor arrays, each functionalized by highly selective
aptamers against targeted cytokines. SA 2: We will integrate the aptamer-conjugated plasmonic nanoantenna
arrays into a single-cell manipulation microfluidic system and achieve real-time single-cell secretion imaging at
high throughput. SA 3: We will develop a two-mode (fluorescence and dark-field) microscopy imaging technique
to image spatiotemporal cytokine secretomic profile patterns and cell surface sytokine binding sites. Using this
technique, we will study the IL-6-mediated dynamic intercellular communication between individual human
hepatoma Hep3b cells and CD 4+ T cells."

Genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have produced a multitude of candidate genes and loci for a wide
range of complex disease and phenotypic traits, but often have not resulted in sufficient mechanistic insight to
lead to actionable changes in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of disease. This is a consequence of key
attributes of the underlying genetic effects which can prove difficult to model, specifically: combinatorial
interactions between multiple loci, a preponderance of regulatory effects which may act at different times and in
in different tissues or organs, and the integration of lifelong multidimensional risk in many of the mapped disease
traits. As the field evolves, so other contributions have begun to be recognized at specific loci including;
modification of the effects of existing Mendelian genes, more complex gene-gene or gene-environment
interactions and a role for somatic variation contributing to diverse chronic diseases.
We have successfully overcome these challenges in our existing Zebrafish GWAS Community Resource by
creating a pipeline which exploits the strengths of rapid scalability, functional relevance and genomic
conservation of the zebrafish model system to generate useful functional annotation of over 100 genes and
regulatory loci over the last 7 years. We have defined the disease gene(s) for multiple GWAS loci in parallel and
moved the field forward to early mechanistic studies. We now propose to extend this Community Resource,
continuing our existing activities while adding key capabilities in a) modeling gene-gene and gene environment
interactions to further explore the complex genetics of numerous common diseases and the b) definitive
modeling of somatic variation including efficient transplantation studies to fully understand the role of somatic
variation in disease. These new capabilities also directly address ongoing requests from the human genetics
community for which the resource was originally developed.
As a consortium, we will continue to push forward the capabilities of the zebrafish as a model organism in this
field and as costs drop, the number of diseases/loci that we will be able to functionally annotate will only grow
through the duration of the proposal. Importantly, we will be able to deliver a comprehensive package of
annotated candidate genes and interactions back to our collaborators in the human genetics community to
enhance the impact and insight derived from their studies. For this renewal application, we propose the following
Specific Aims:
Aim 1 - Functionally analyze loci from multiple GWAS studies on blood, liver, heart and vessel traits, optimizing
assay development and gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in zebrafish.
Aim 2 - Quantitatively characterize gene-gene and gene-environment interactions where these have been
implicated in human genetics
Aim 3 - Modeling the role of somatic variation at GWAS loci in chronic disease"

surface receptors, and transcription factors known to directly drive developmental processes.
Recently, we discovered that manipulation of an epigenetic regulator of lymphoid potential promotes
the generation of mature, functional T cells from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
demonstrating an important role for epigenetic modulators in T cell development and function. To
date, the epigenetic regulation of T cell development remains elusive. In this application, we propose
to test the hypothesis that iPSCs provide a platform to identify novel mechanisms regulating T cell
development, and new insights into epigenetic regulations of T cell differentiation can be used to
facilitate the generation of more robust iPSC-T cells for adoptive T cell immunotherapy. Previously,
we have established a stroma-free differentiation system that faithfully recapitulates T cell
development in culture. In Aim 1, we will perform small molecule screens at different stages of iPSC-
T cell differentiation to discover new epigenetic regulators that can affect lymphoid specification and T
cell maturation. We have provided a proof-of-concept by conducting a pilot screen using a library of
small molecules that modulate the activity of epigenetic modification enzymes. The screen identified
several epigenetic modulators, such as histone methyltransferase G9a, that promote T cell fate
commitment. In Aim 2, we will transition our study to mechanistically examine how epigenetic
regulations govern lymphocyte fate decisions via modulating chromatin structure. The impact of
epigenetic modulators, including G9a, on lymphopoiesis will be probed in both iPSC-derived blood
cells and zebrafish models. Lastly, Aim 3 will focus on using small molecule-mediate epigenetic
modulation to facilitate the production of mature iPSC-T cells with enhanced function. Success in the
proposed study will not only improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the
formation of immune cells but also open new avenues for stem cell-based immunotherapies. The
career development award will allow me to develop new skills necessary to fulfill the proposed goals
and foster my development into an independent investigator."
10894268,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Although individually rare, Mendelian diseases are collectively common. Nearly 1% of people have a
medical condition that can be traced back to a single gene. This is particularly true for patients with
cardiovascular disease. Genetic testing is now commonly employed in clinical practice. As a result, it has
become clear that we have an incomplete understanding of how genetic mutations cause Mendelian disease.
Some patients with deleterious mutations display very severe symptoms while others are almost entirely
unaffected. This is true even for childhood-onset disorders with severe cardiovascular symptoms, like Marfan
Syndrome. Understanding the range of disease severity has important implications for diagnosis, prognosis,
and management. In the past, cohort studies and case series have been used to gather this type of information,
but these yield incomplete and biased views of disease heterogeneity. Therefore, new methods for studying
Mendelian disease genetic and phenotypic diversity are urgently needed.
 Population-scale biobanks linked to electronic health records (EHRs) can provide a less biased view of
genotype-to-phenotype relationships. Subjects are included in these datasets regardless of their medical
history. EHR data also provides detailed phenotypic information on each subject. Finally, these biobanks now
include hundreds of thousands of individuals, capturing rare genetic variation on an unprecedented scale. As a
result, we hypothesize that population-scale biobanks can provide new insight into the genotype-to-phenotype
relationships that underlie congenital cardiovascular syndromes (CCSs). This hypothesis will be tested in two
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use biobanks to develop quantitative scores that reproducibly summarize CCS-
related phenotypic severity. These traits have multiple applications. In Aim 2, we will use them to build
computational models that predict the phenotypic effects of CCS-related rare variants directly from sequence
context. Once validated, these models should reduce diagnostic uncertainty in clinical practice.
 I am a clinical geneticist and physician-scientist devoted to improving the quality of healthcare
provided to Mendelian disease patients. Long term, I plan to develop an independent research program that
uses complex clinical and genetic datasets to improve our understanding of Mendelian disease risk, variability,
and progression. My K38 research proposal is entirely consistent with these goals. In addition, it will provide
valuable career development. New technical skills in EHR data analysis and statistical genetics will be acquired,
as will academic skills like grant writing. During the award, I will be mentored by leaders in the fields of
biomedical data science and human genetics, including Dr. Atul Butte and Dr. Neil Risch. Finally, the K38
award will serve as springboard for future funding opportunities and research independence. Therefore, the
K38 StARRTS award will serve as a critical milestone in my development as a physician scientist."
10840871,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain oscillations are thought to be critical for cognitive functions and are disrupted in all major
neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, depression, and
schizophrenia. There has been increasing interest in understanding the relation between neural
computations and oscillatory patterns in the healthy and diseased brain because oscillation patterns
can be targeted for treatment with noninvasive and invasive stimulation devices. While most brain
rhythms are generated by either neuronal pacemakers or local circuits, breathing generates rhythmic
brain activity by an external loop. Nasal air flow stimulates olfactory sensory neurons which generate
respiration-related oscillations (RROs) in the olfactory bulb (OB). RROs have been shown to widely
propagate to cortical areas, including piriform cortex (PC), prefrontal cortical areas, lateral entorhinal
cortex (lEC), and hippocampus (HC). In HC, RROs can be detected in parallel with pacemaker-
generated theta oscillations, which are critical for memory function and overlap in frequency. It is not
clear to what extent the two types of oscillations are merely parallel phenomena or functionally
coordinated to support neural computations. We hypothesize that RROs and theta oscillations do not
globally couple, but that subpopulations of neurons across brain regions are synchronized with each
oscillation pattern across different memory phases. To address this question, we will perform
recordings and manipulations of local field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal firing patterns in odor-
guided working memory tasks, where both types of oscillations are prominent. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether RROs, theta oscillations, and oscillations at higher frequencies are coordinated
across brain regions in an olfactory working memory task by recording LFPs and/or single-units in
the OB, anterior PC, lEC, ventral HC, dorsal HC, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These brain
regions are included because RROs and canonical theta oscillations have been reported in all of these
regions and because these brain regions are thought to be critical for working memory performance.
In Aim 2, we will then use optogenetics to change the frequency of RROs and canonical theta
oscillations to determine during which phases of working memory they are critical for task
performance. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use a match/non-match version of the odor-guided working
memory task to determine how the initial sensory code is transformed into activity patterns that
remain informative over the retention interval. Taken together, our aims will reveal how neuronal
activity patterns are coordinated by two types of oscillations during working memory. A mechanistic
understanding of brain oscillations that support memory computations is foundational for devising
and applying brain stimulation therapies to improve memory in neurological and psychiatric diseases."

 For people living with multiple sclerosis (MS), numerous clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
sessions are needed to assess symptoms and/or presence of lesions. Even then, outcome prediction and
treatment choice are challenging. To realize the full potential of personalized medicine, specific biomarkers
reflecting function (e.g. inflammation, redox) are needed for comprehensive characterization and phenotyping.
 Over the initially funded 5-year period of this grant, we have firmly established that hyperpolarized (HP) 13C
MR Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI) is a highly valuable neuroimaging method for assessment of MS lesions. We
were the first to show that 13C MRSI of HP [1-13C]pyruvate can detect increased HP lactate-to-pyruvate, linked
to proinflammatory microglia/macrophages (MPs) in a MS mouse model, a finding further confirmed in other
models. We also demonstrated that HP 13C MR could monitor early response to immunomodulatory therapies,
e.g. dimethylfumarate (DMF). Additionally, we showed that, as MPs phenotype is linked to levels of Reactive
Oxygen Species (ROS), HP [1-13C]dehydroxyascorbic acid (DHA), a redox-sensing HP probe, could differentiate
between M1 and M2 MPs, thus non-invasively assessing these orthogonal processes.
 In this renewal, we will build upon the successes of the first funded period and 1/develop improved HP 13C
metabolic imaging approaches to assess neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in MS and 2/conduct the first
human study applying HP 13C metabolic imaging to monitor therapy response in people living with MS.
 Specific Aim 1. Provide a comprehensive picture of metabolic impairment in MS using HP [1-
13C]pyruvate. 13C MRSI of HP [1-13C]pyruvate will be optimized at clinical field strength to simultaneously detect
oxidative and glycolytic metabolism through assessment of bicarbonate and lactate kinetics, respectively, in two
preclinical MS models at 3 Tesla. Spatial genomics, immunostainings and biochemical assays will be performed
on paired ex vivo samples to investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the HP readouts.
 Specific Aim 2. Differentiate orthogonal neuroinflammatory processes using HP g-Glutamyl-[1-
13C]Glycine. We will investigate the potential of g-Glu-[1-13C]Gly to assess oxidative stress as a read-out of
M1/M2 status in two MS models. To do so, 13C MRSI of HP g-Glu-[1-13C]Gly will be optimized to measure GGT
activity in vivo through detection of HP [1-13C]Glycine in preclinical MS models at 3 Tesla. Ex vivo analysis of
tissue samples will be performed as in Aim 1 to investigate the underlying mechanisms driving the HP readouts.
 Specific Aim 3. Perform the first study of MS patients using HP [1-13C]pyruvate: 3A. We will perform a
pilot study on 8 RRMS patients naïve to disease modifying therapies (DMTs), to optimize HP [1-13C] pyruvate
MRI parameters for improved resolution at 3 Tesla. 3B. We will then image 32 RRMS patients naïve to DMTs
using parameters defined in 3A, at baseline, and after 1 and 3 months of DMF/MMF therapy. Associations
between new metabolic imaging markers and standard clinical MRI (T1 pre/post Gd, T2) will be evaluated."

More than 500,000 persons require maintenance hemodialysis (pMHD) per year in the United States,
disproportionately affecting persons who are Black or Hispanic. pMHD are an Agency of Healthcare Research
and Quality priority population. Infections are the second most common cause of mortality among pMHD due to
a uremia-induced immunocompromised state and multiple co-morbidities. pMHD are also at substantial risk of
hospital-acquired infections (HAI) as they are admitted to the hospital on average twice per year. Compared to
the general hospitalized population, pMHD have a 2.4-fold higher risk of developing an HAI. There is a
tremendous paucity of data pertaining to the epidemiology of HAI among pMHD, including potential racial and
ethnic disparities. In this proposal, entitled “The INFECTADO study: INFECTions Acquired by persons on
maintenance hemoDialysis during hOspitalizations”, we will quantify and characterize the epidemiology of HAI
among pMHD. This proposal will therefore generate important information as how to best improve current
prevention strategies aimed at reducing HAI in pMHD. Under aims 1 and 2, we will use the Unites States Renal
Data System (USRDS), a nationwide-Medicare database, to analyze prevalence, risk factors and outcomes of
HAI over an 8-year study period (~360,000 pMHD per year). Analyses will also focus on MHD modality type,
race/ethnicity and social determinants of health. Under aim 3, we will use the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s National Healthcare Safety Network-based active surveillance data from 31 hospitals within the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center hospital network over an 8-year period (~4,777 pMHD per year), to
further characterize HAI epidemiology, including causative pathogens and antimicrobial resistance profiles. By
using two different data sources, a complete characterization of HAI epidemiology among pMHD will be obtained,
since each data source provides supplementary data, as outlined in the proposal. The interdisciplinary team is
comprised of investigators who have produced an abundance of scholarly end-stage renal disease research
efforts over the last 2-decades and have expertise in infections among pMHD, data analyses using the USRDS
and HAI active surveillance methodologies. A summary of specific aims are 1] Aims 1 and 2: To quantify and
characterize HAI prevalence, risk factors and outcomes among all pMHD with and without HAI, and between: a]
in-center vs home MHD, b] Black persons vs persons of other races on MHD and c] Hispanic vs non-Hispanic
persons on MHD, using the USRDS database and 2] Aim 3: To quantify and characterize HAI epidemiology
among pMHD with an HAI compared to hospitalized persons with an HAI, including causative pathogens and
antimicrobial resistance profiles, using active infection surveillance. This proposal will result in an increased
understanding of HAI epidemiology among the high-risk group of pMHD and health disparities within this
population, and will provide important information to guide future prevention strategies aimed at reducing HAI
and improving patient outcomes."

Structural racism is a fundamental cause of health inequity. There is an urgent need to train health professionals
on structural and social determinants of health, and the role of health care bias in perpetuating and exacerbating
health disparities. Simultaneously, the US maternal health crisis has fueled increasing recognition of curricular
gaps in sexual and reproductive health equity for obstetrics and gynecology (Ob/Gyn) practitioners, and
specifically best practices in research on race, sex, and gender as they relate to quality of care and patient
experience. Initiating this instruction early in medical training and establishing core competencies in unbiased
and antiracist health care practice is critical to cultivating the next generation of clinicians. We aim to develop,
implement, and evaluate a curriculum for medical school learners about the intersection of race, ethnicity, sex,
and gender in Oby/Gyn health care equity. Specifically, we will develop didactic modules on topics including
social and structural determinants of health, gendered racism, intersectionality, reproductive justice, health care
discrimination, and care of gender diverse individuals, with cross-cutting themes of best practices in research,
biologic mechanisms, and interventions (Aim 1). We will create a reflective learning community app to bridge
didactic lectures to clinical clerkships (Aim 2). We will engage community representatives and medical school
learners in co-design of curriculum and app content, including novel integration of narrative and graphic medicine
tools to illustrate patient experiences and lessons for research and clinical care. Finally, we will implement the
curriculum with 140 medical school learners in Ob/Gyn clerkship and elective didactics and evaluate program
objectives through longitudinal learner surveys (Aim 3). At project completion, we will have a portable model for
clinical training programs, using student-led, applied, and reflective learning to bridge research and practice.
This model is responsive to the RFA-OD-22-015 goal to support creative educational activities that develop skills
in multidimensional and intersectional health-related research and healthcare delivery and will fill a critical gap
in physician training, with the expected impact of advancing equity in Ob/Gyn health care quality and outcomes."
10903885,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors is hindered by a lack of tumor-specific antigens that are safe to target and
homogenously expressed throughout the tumor, difficulty infiltrating the tumor due to dense tumor stroma, and
suppression of CAR T cell function by the tumor microenvironment (TME). We plan to address these issues
using novel meso-FAP CAR-TEAM cells that simultaneously target mesothelin, a solid tumor antigen that has
already been proven safe to target in patients, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which inhibit T cell
infiltration and suppress T cell function in the TME. The CAFs are targeted with T cell-engaging antibody
molecules (TEAMs) secreted from the CAR T cells that bind to CD3 and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which
is highly expressed on CAFs. The TEAM allows for CAF elimination by CAR and non-CAR T cells in the tumor.
We have already demonstrated that meso-FAP CAR-TEAM cells kill pancreatic cancer cells and CAFs in vitro,
in vivo, and in patient-derived ex vivo models and have superior anti-tumor function compared to meso-CAR T
cells alone. For the UG3 phase of this project, we will further optimize meso-FAP CAR-TEAM cells by
determining the best mesothelin binder to use (SS1 vs. a novel binder developed by our lab), optimal route of
injection (IV vs. IP) for targeting pancreatic tumors, and rationale drug combinations that address CAR T cell
limitations in solid tumors. We will improve antigen density using an ADAM17 inhibitor (INCB7839) to prevent
mesothelin cleavage from pancreatic cancer cells, optimize CAR T cell killing and persistence using ibrutinib to
polarize meso-FAP CAR T cells to a Th1/Th17 phenotype, and further prevent suppression by the tumor
microenvironment using a PD1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). These drugs will be singly combined with meso-FAP
CAR-TEAM cells to determine which best promotes efficacy in our preclinical models. Collectively, these results
will inform the design of a phase I clinical trial for pancreatic cancer patients with advanced disease. During the
UH3 phase, we will determine the safety and tolerability of meso-FAP CAR-TEAM cells. We have chosen
pancreatic cancer as our first solid tumor target due to the dismal prognosis of the disease, the high percentage
of patients with mesothelin-expressing tumors, and the known role of CAFs in promoting tumor growth. While
our primary objective will be to determine safety, we will also monitor patient outcomes (progression and survival)
while performing correlative studies to determine CAR T cell phenotype and function. We will also monitor the
tumor and tumor microenvironment for mechanisms of response or resistance, such as changes in antigen
expression and immunosuppressive cells. Overall, this project will develop a novel CAR-TEAM design to target
a solid tumor and its microenvironment while optimizing the trial design through rigorous preclinical testing. If
successful, the meso-FAP CAR T cell product could be directly applied to other mesothelin-expressing solid
tumors and the knowledge gained from the UG3 phase will inform on the critical aspects of CAR T cell function
to optimize prior to initiating a clinical trial."

10747988,"Project Summary
Breast cancer (BC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women. In addition, metastatic BC has a 5-year
survival rate of only 27% and metastases are associated with the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Recent
research has highlighted a complex dynamic between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment as essential
for the formation of macrometastases. Within this field, tissue stiffening through matrix accumulation and altered
matrix organization were recently linked with sustained proliferation and increased migration of tumor cells.
Elevated levels of the glycoprotein fibronectin (FN) have been correlated to poor patient survival in BC and are
linked to enhanced seeding of disseminated tumor cells at metastatic sites. My previous work has indicated
several mechanisms through which accumulated FN impacts the metastatic potential of BC cells. Foremost, I
helped identify a transient increase in extracellular FN in the lungs, which peaked before overt metastasis,
coupled with a non-transient increase in total lung volume. I further found that cyclic mechanical force acted as
a suppressor of cancer cell growth in a biomimetic lung model, implicating the accumulation of extracellular
matrix (ECM) as an attempt by the cancer cells to alter the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and resist
entering dormancy. However, my results showed that BC cells could not organize FN into ECM independently.
Instead, BC cells altered the accumulation and architecture of FN by conditioning resident fibroblasts through
soluble factors and extracellular vesicles. I observed that the FN produced by conditioned fibroblasts varied not
only based on the phenotype of the BC cell, but also from the method of conditioning which tested paracrine and
endocrine signaling. These preliminary results indicate that unique subtypes of cancer associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) may develop based on the BC cell conditioning mechanism, where unique subtypes may be associated
with the specific needs of the various stages of the metastatic cascade. Therefore, Aim 1 of the proposed studies
during my Ph.D. research will define the contribution of cyclic strain on BC cell phenotype and dormancy using
our novel actuating platform. Aim 2, which I will undertake during my postdoctoral research, will seek to better
define the varied roles of CAFs in metastatic progression through the development of a foundation of subtypes
after conditioning with media, isolated extracellular vesicles, and contact from BC cancer cells, including
metastatic and non-metastatic BC cells with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. These findings will enable
advanced interaction studies and promote the development of novel targets for fibroblasts, which may be a more
consistent target than genetically unstable cancer cells and lead to more effective treatment. In addition, the
proposed studies and training plan will expand my current tissue engineering skillset to include advanced
understanding of mechanotransduction pathways and CAF formation as well as improve my communication,
mentoring, and teaching. Together, these skills will place me as a competitive candidate for an independent
principle investigator position in a research university at the intersection of cancer biology and engineering."
10764314,"Summary/Abstract:
I am a postdoctoral fellow at Indiana University who has developed a unique set of skills in tumor immunology
and cancer immunotherapy. Throughout my graduate and postdoctoral studies, I established a productive track-
record with seven first/co-first author manuscripts and a total of 18 top-tier peer-reviewed research and review
papers, including: Nature Nanotechnology, ACS Nano, Nature Communications, The Journal of Clinical
Investigation, Cancer Immunology Research and JCI Insight. Furthermore, I am listed as co-inventor on several
patent applications.
Development/Training: My long-term goal is to establish myself as an independent researcher with the focus
on cancer immunotherapy. Throughout the years, my research became unique in the immunotherapy field as I
am bridging multiple disciplines. This unique skill set requires in-depth knowledge in immunology and
immunotherapy as well as solid understanding in bioinformatics, nanotechnology and the biomedical engineering
field. The K99/R00 award will help in achieving my goal, as I will be guided towards becoming an independent
investigator under the guidance of extremely well-established scientists such as Dr. Xiongbin Lu (cancer biology)
and Dr. Sophie Paczesny (immunology and immunotherapy). I will also closely collaborate with Dr. Chi Zhang
(bioinformatics deconvolution) and Dr. Kenneth Dunn (CODEX® Technology and microscopy).
Research: Despite unprecedented clinical tumor regression observed with checkpoint immunotherapy in
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients harboring microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) tumors, a large proportion of
patients receive little to no improvement. Thus, additional checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in new pathways are
needed; investigation of tumor microenvironment (TME) cell infiltrates and soluble factors will shed light on
possible targets as well as potential pitfalls to such immunotherapies. In this proposal, I will determine the role
of the interleukin-33 (IL-33) and its receptor STimulation 2 (ST2) in CRC immunotherapy. In my JCI Insight
published preliminary data, I established that ST2 expressing tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) hamper
CD8+ T-cell responses. I therefore hypothesize that ST2 expressing TAMs play an essential role in suppressing
antigen-specific T-cell mediated immune responses and that targeting these TAMs could serve as a potential
novel immune checkpoint pathway. Moreover, I will also investigate the role of ST2 on CRC tumor cells and the
contribution of activating the IL-33/ST2 pathway leading to cancer immunotherapy resistance. Finally, I will
assess the translational potential of IL-33/ST2 therapeutic blockade using the IL-33-trap fusion protein to trap
free local and systemic IL-33 or as an alternative approach a ST2 small molecule inhibitor that will block the
functional binding of IL-33 to its ST2 receptor complex, and these agents in combination with other checkpoint
immunotherapy. Support through this award will greatly increase my likelihood to obtain an R01 at an early
career stage."
10917259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe mental illness with the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder, with
suicide as the second leading cause of death. Despite extremely high rates of suicide, risk factors for suicidal
ideation (SI) and behaviors/attempts (SA) in this high-risk population are not well understood. While there is
evidence that threat reactivity, stress-response, over-arousal, emotion dysregulation, and agitation contribute
to suicide risk, the dynamic relations among these processes have not been characterized on a
comprehensive, momentary basis. Our scientific premise, developed from our past work, is that the application
of ideation-to-action and network theories will enable the identification of dynamic longitudinal interactions
among core dimensions (e.g., arousal, threat), AN symptoms, and SI/SA both between and within individuals.
Our study goals are to (1) identify symptom and dimension risk interactions of co-occurring AN and SI/SA
between and within persons, (2) differentiate which risk factors predict SI vs SA and (3) test if these risk factors
predict onset of SI/SA. These goals will ultimately identify which factors should be targeted in novel prevention
and treatment efforts. We will use a multiple units of analysis approach, combined with novel, cutting-edge
advances in suicide and network science. We will collect intensive real-time data on AN and suicide behaviors,
anxiety, over-arousal, emotion regulation, and agitation using mobile technology, as well as
psychophysiological assessment of emotion regulation (via heart-rate variability) and arousal (via
electrodermal activity characterizing over-arousal and acceleration characterizing the sleep-wake cycle), from
230 individuals with a diagnosis of AN/Atypical AN (AAN). At 1-month, 6-month, and one year follow-up we will
test if individual risk factors predict SI/SA. We expect 35-58 participants will have SA across our study period.
Specific aims are to (1) test which symptoms and dimensions across time and between-persons maintain
comorbid SI/SA and AN symptoms, (2) develop personalized network models to identify which suicide and AN
features predict SI/SA within individuals and an exploratory aim (3) to test if there are differences between AN
and AAN. The proposed research uses highly innovative methods, combining intensive longitudinal data
collection methods, measurement of physiological data via wearable sensor technology, and novel advances in
network science to answer previously unresolvable questions pinpointing which individual risk factors
contribute to suicide outcomes. The proposed research has clinical impact. If we identify patterns that
contribute to suicide risk, these data will provide a model of personalized medicine for the entire field of
psychiatry, as well as providing novel intervention targets to prevent and treat AN spectrum illnesses.
Additionally, the algorithms we develop can be used in both (a) clinician friendly software to identify treatment
targets to prevent SI/SA and (b) in wearable alert devices that can disrupt SA before it occurs."
10930106,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the most common cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy. Currently, it is impossible to predict or prevent SUDEP. However, SUDEPs that have occurred in
monitored settings were characterized by hypoventilation and apnea prior to cardiac dysfunction, implicating
seizure-related respiratory dysfunction as a critical factor. Human intracranial data suggests the amygdala as a
forebrain structure that may be important for respiratory control and involved in seizure-related respiratory
dysfunction. Understanding the neural circuit mechanisms involving amygdalar structures that underlies
seizure-related respiratory dysfunction that leads to hypoventilation and death is critical to advancing SUDEP
prevention options, which currently do not exist. Our long-term goal is to identify the neural circuits underlying
seizure-related respiratory dysfunction to predict and prevent sudden death. The main objective of the
proposed project is to delineate brainstem projecting extended amygdalar neurons involved in seizure-related
respiratory dysfunction and arrest. Preliminary data in a mouse model of SUDEP show that the extended
amygdalar structure the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) represents a potential mediator underlying
seizure-related respiratory dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that BNST activation during seizures contributes to
seizure-related respiratory dysfunction, respiratory arrest, and death via downstream activation in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN) of the pons. This hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims in a
model of SUDEP: (1) Characterize the role of BNST and BNSTPBN activation in respiratory dysfunction in a
model of SUDEP. (2) Determine the effect of acute BNST inhibition on seizure-induced respiratory dysfunction
in a model of SUDEP. In Aim 1, we will use a viral approach to selectively identify and dissect BNST neurons
activated by seizures as well as determine the relationship between BNST activation and respiratory
dysfunction during seizures. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo optogenetic inactivation of the BNST to determine the
critical period of activity for respiratory depression and potential intervention. At the successful completion of
the proposed research, the expected outcomes are characterization of seizure-activated BNST-brainstem
circuitry and the temporal relationship of BNST activation to seizure-related respiratory dysfunction to
determine sufficiency and the timepoint necessary for acute BNST activation in this effect. The proposed
research is conceptually innovative through its focus on BNST circuitry in terms of SUDEP pathophysiology
and technically innovative through the use of cutting-edge systems neuroscience techniques applied to
SUDEP including fiber photometry, virally-mediated Targeted Recombination in Active Populations (TRAP) and
in vivo optogenetics. These results are expected to have a significant impact on our current understanding of
alterations of forebrain respiratory circuits that lead to SUDEP and will provide a strong basis for future
development of novel therapeutics and clinical targets for neuromodulation to prevent SUDEP."

 There are hundreds of genomic loci where common genetic variants associate with the risk of cardiac
arrhythmias, yet the slow rate of functional assessment severely limits our ability to unlock the unique biology
that they identify. Our long-term goal is to systematically link arrhythmia risk loci to their mechanisms, identifying
the unexpected mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis, and priming them for therapeutic translation. The key feature
of arrhythmia genetic association loci is their non-protein-coding nature, a finding which leads to our overarching
hypothesis that transcriptional misregulation underlies much of cardiac arrhythmia risk. To address this
hypothesis, we first examine the relationships between known arrhythmia target genes which encode
transcription factors and cardiomyocyte electrophysiology using inducible CRISPR-Cas9 modifiers of gene
expression. We will seek to understand the transcriptional changes underlying electrophysiological changes by
profiling gene expression and protein abundance. At the same time, we recognize that the vast majority of loci
remain entirely undefined, a limitation which serves as a great impediment to further translational research. To
address this, we will use two orthogonal approaches in human atrial tissue samples. First, our group has led
early large-scale implementations of single nucleus RNA sequencing on the human heart, experience which we
propose to extend to the goals of this proposal. We aim to link genotype to expression by performing single
nucleus RNA sequencing on a large biobank of non-diseased left atrial tissue with available genotypes and
clinical metadata. This will provide not only the target gene(s) for the association loci, but also the directionality
of effect and the pertinent cell type(s), greatly facilitating downstream validation by our team and others. To
complement the direct measurement of genotype to expression, we aim to supplement these analyses with
chromatin conformation analysis. While these assays do not resolve the effects of genotype, they measure
contact between regions of risk and target promoters to provide putative gene targets. Our preliminary high-
resolution contact map from the left atrial lateral wall greatly improved the number of candidate genes for atrial
fibrillation association loci. We recognize the importance of anatomically restricted events in the initiation and
propagation of arrhythmias, and thus propose to assess the physical proximity between regulatory elements
within association loci and their putative gene targets in prospectively sampled atrial tissues using micro-C, a
technology which assesses chromatin conformation across the entire genome. Ultimately, accomplishing these
aims could prove transformative for facilitating studies of cardiac arrhythmias, unlocking the mechanisms of
arrhythmia genetic risk to generate novel therapeutic approaches and guide clinical practices."

In 2020, with over 250 million debilitating cases and over half a million deaths, mostly in young children,
malaria is a persistent global health crisis. The malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
has developed resistance to most antimalarial drug deployed, including the backbone artemisinins
(ARTs). ART and its semi-synthetic analogs are considered essential for malaria treatment. ARTs are
prodrugs that are activated within the parasites to form a reactive radical that covalently attacks
proteins, lipids and other cellular constituents. ART resistance is widespread in Southeast Asia and has
been reported in Africa. ART combination therapy (ACT) is a mainstay for treatment of malaria, but its
efficacy can be derailed when a two-drug combination becomes de facto monotherapy. Moreover,
extended exposure of Pf to ACTs induces multidrug tolerance. We recently showed that inhibitors
specific for the Pf proteasome (Pf20S) kill Pf in each stage of its life cycle and synergize with ART,
overcoming ART resistance. This proposal builds on our discovery that a covalent hybrid of an ART
analogue and a Pf20S inhibitor that we call an artezomib (ATZ) can enhance ART action and overcome
resistance to each of its components. We have synthesized ATZs that are more potent Pf20S inhibitors
than their component Pf20S inhibitor. They not only kill wild type and ART-resistant (K13 mutant) Pf, Pf
with proteasome mutations that confer resistance to the Pf20S inhibitor, but also kill Pf that expresses
both ART-resistant and PI-resistant mutations. We propose the following mechanism by which ATZs
overcome resistance to the Pf20S inhibitor within them: We found that upon activation of ATZ in the
parasites, the ART component binds Pf proteins, like activated ART itself. The Pf ubiquitin proteasome
system digests ATZ-bound proteins into oligopeptides, some of which display the Pf inhibitor
component of the ATZ. We hypothesize that extended contact of ATZ-bearing peptides within the
Pf20S active site augments the binding of the Pf20S inhibitor component of the ATZ, overcoming the
decreased binding otherwise conferred by Pf20S point mutations. Thus, an ATZ can overcome
resistance to each of its components. In mouse models of malaria, an ATZ drove P. berghei below the
limit of detection and suppressed recrudescence of a P. berghei ART-resistant K13 mutant and doing
so better than ART. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct lead optimization to improve ATZs'
potency, selectivity and ATZs' pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will explore ATZs' mechanism
of action; attempt to select for ATZ-resistant parasites; determine the frequency and mechanism of
resistance, if any; and study antimalarial activity of ATZs in stages of the Pf life cycle when ART alone
is ineffective. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of ATZs in mice, including humanized mice infected with Pf.

Systemic mono- or combination- immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) immunotherapy has been an established
therapeutic paradigm. However, a risk of serious autoimmune side effect has been evidenced with non-specific
cytotoxic T cell expansion. Substantial research has investigated into how best to harness the antitumor
potential of combination immunotherapies and how to direct immunotherapies at the tumor. Hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) is the 5th most common malignancy in the world and the 4th leading cause of cancer death in
the US. Resection and transplantation are the sole potentially curative treatments for HCC, but only 10-15% of
patients are candidates. Recent clinical trials demonstrate the potential of ICB antibodies against programmed
cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1 for the treatment of HCC. However, the strong immune suppressive
microenvironment and low expression of immune checkpoint molecules within the HCC tumor lead to a
resistance to immunotherapy in HCC; thus, the efficacy of ICB immunotherapy may not be sufficient to elicit
durable clinical benefits. 90Y-radioembolization (90Y-RE) can precisely deliver high doses of radiation to HCC,
protecting healthy tissues and avoiding side effects. 90Y-RE should be an ideal complement to ICB
immunotherapy given that 90Y-RE induces immunogenic cell death. Recently clinical trials have been initiated
to evaluate systemic ICB immunotherapy in combination with 90Y-RE in the hope of enhancing overall
therapeutic effects. However, one limitation that accounts for the compromised efficacy of combined ICB
immunotherapy is off-target binding of the ICBs to normal tissues upon systemic administration. Ideally these
ICBs should be delivered selectively to the tumor lesion to avoid systemic non-specific activation of the
immune system. We propose catheter-directed intra-arterial (IA) infusion of anti-PD-L1 (aPD-L1) loaded Au
supra-nanostructures (AuSN) in a combination with 90Y-RE. Catheter directed local infusion of aPD-L1 with
high surface area and reactive oxygen species responsive degradable AuSN will augment the localization of
immunotherapy to the targeted HCC permitting radiation-enhanced activation of the immune system for
superior therapeutic outcomes. Our proposed tumoral IA infused anti-PD-L1 loaded AuSN will permit efficient
and targeted delivery of immunostimulatory aPD-L1 to allow an increase in the dosage and improved safety
profile. The local ICB delivery of AuSN carriers will offer the potential to significantly increase the local immune-
stimulating efficacy of 90Y-RE. Our CT visible AuSN and cross-sectional CT and MR image guidance should
also permit us to monitor/track/quantify the delivery of aPD-L1-AuSN to the targeted tumor tissues. It should
allow early prediction of elicited responses to prompt timely adjustments to individual treatment regimens.
Through a collaborative project, we seek to develop a powerful new approach for tumor directed local
combinational aPD-L1 immunotherapy and 90Y-RE for the treatment of HCC."

Candida auris (CA), an emerging multi-drug resistant fungal pathogen that predominately colonizes in the skin
has recently been classified as an urgent threat by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
Antibiotic Threats Report. CA asymptomatically colonizes the skin for prolonged periods and rapidly spreads
between hospitalized patients and nursing home residents via nosocomial transmission resulting in outbreaks of
systemic infections. CA gains access to the blood in patients requiring indwelling devices leading to invasive
infections resulting in mortality ranging from 40 to 60 percent among CA infected patients. Majority of CA isolates
exhibit resistance to all three classes of FDA-approved antifungal drugs including azoles, polyenes, and
echinocandins posing a significant challenge to treat this fungal pathogen. Therefore, understanding the factors
regulating CA skin colonization is important to control CA outbreaks and prevent invasive CA infections.
Recently, we have uncovered that skin microbiota regulate the CA skin colonization. Based on our compelling
data, we will define the microbiota and host mediated mechanism(s) that control CA skin colonization. In Aim 1,
we will define how skin microbiota directly inhibit CA growth and skin colonization and In Aim 2, we will define
the host-mediated mechanisms through which skin microbiota regulate CA skin colonization. Understanding the
microbiota and host factors in the regulation of CA is expected to lead to a more complete understanding of the
factors that control CA skin colonization, with the long-term aim of identifying new antifungal therapeutic
strategies."

The incidence of calcium phosphate (CaP) stone disease has markedly increased over the last four decades.
CaP stone formers experience high rates of stone recurrence and frequently need repeat stone surgery,
indicating that current prophylactic medical regimen are suboptimal. The most common metabolic abnormalities
identified in CaP stone formers are hypercalciuria, hypocitraturia, and elevated urine pH, all factors that increase
CaP saturation. Alkali therapy (potassium citrate) is well-established to prevent calcium oxalate stones, in part
by raising urine citrate. However, when tested in CaP stone formers at doses targeted at normalizing citrate
excretion, alkali therapy may worsen CaP stones due to a concomitant rise in urine pH. Hydroxycitrate is a
molecule closely related to citrate that has been shown to prevent CaP nucleation in vitro. However, its efficacy
against CaP stone formation in vivo has not been previously studied. Our preliminary studies suggest that: 1)
Hydroxycitrate can exert a powerful inhibitory effect on CaP crystal growth at low concentrations; 2) Oral
hydroxycitrate ingestion is well-tolerated and raises urine OHCit excretion to concentrations that reduce CaP
crystallization in urine; 3) Oral hydroxycitrate administration increases urine citrate without significantly
increasing urine pH. In this proposal, we will therefore test the overall hypothesis that hydroxycitrate can serve
as a treatment to prevent recurrence of CaP stone disease. To test this hypotheses, we will combine three
complementary approaches: 1) In human metabolic studies conducted in CaP stone formers, we will examine
the short-term impact of a. escalating doses of hydroxycitrate and b. comparative effectiveness of hydroxycitrate
vs alkali therapy (potassium citrate) on urinary biochemical and physicochemical parameters, and CaP crystal
growth and dissolution using atomic force microscopy and bulk crystallization studies conducted on participants’
urine specimen. 2) In an animal model of CaP precipitation, we will assess the long-term impact of the same
interventions to be tested in humans with measurement of urine chemistry, crystalluria, and development of
calcification in kidneys. 3) In vitro, we will manipulate hydroxycitrate, calcium, citrate, and pH, and assess CaP
crystal growth and solubility by a unique combination of techniques spanning multiple length scales. Notably, we
will examine microscopic surface growth by atomic force microscopy, macroscopic crystal nucleation and growth
in a microfluidic device, and the kinetics of bulk crystallization over a range of clinically relevant hydroxycitrate
concentrations. We will test the mechanisms by which hydroxycitrate exerts its impact on CaP crystal growth
and dissolution, and assess the cooperative effects of hydroxycitrate and citrate concentration using a range of
clinically relevant pH and ionic strengths. Overall, based on our strong preliminary data, our innovative but
rigorous techniques, and our cross-disciplinary complimentary studies, we hope that this proposal will help
identify optimal therapeutics for the increasingly encountered and difficult to treat CaP stones."
10916477,"Summary
Imbalanced levels of neuromodulators and other chemical signals contribute to a host of neurological disorders.
Yet, previous studies describing these effects often examine only one molecule at a time, and typically provide
a static description of signal levels in the brain or in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes all neurons. In
reality, dozens of signals exhibit dynamic changes across states such as quiet waking and social or non-social
arousal, which are altered in disease. The tracking and manipulation of patterns of neural activity has been
critical to recent neuroscience progress. We lack analogous tools for estimation and control of dynamic patterns
of neuromodulatory signals, which could revolutionize the study of brain states and effectively restore healthy
states across neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we do not understand how any given
neuropsychiatric drug dynamically influences the levels of endogenous neuromodulators and peptides in the
CSF or brain, thus impeding the rational design of optimal drug delivery strategies to maximize efficacy and
minimize side effects. These blind spots are due to technical limitations: while cellular imaging and optogenetics
have enabled ever-increasing precision in tracking and manipulation of brain cells, we lack the ability to
accurately (i) record or (ii) control multiple neuromodulatory signals simultaneously in real time. We are
overcoming the first challenge by developing novel methods for multiplexed, quantitative imaging of a panel of
green fluorescent protein-based optical sensors of disease-relevant neuromodulatory signals (Aim 1):
vasopressin, oxytocin, somatostatin, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, melatonin,
corticotropin-releasing factor, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and adenosine. Briefly, sets of cultured cells
expressing individual sensors are combined in a 3D hydrogel sensor array applied to the front of a gradient
refractive index (GRIN) lens, which is inserted into the CSF or brain tissue of an awake, head-fixed mouse via a
chronic cannula. Estimates of signal concentration using 3D two-photon imaging of the sensor array are then
calibrated via post-hoc robotic dipping of the same sensor array into varying concentrations of each
neuromodulator ex vivo. Once we have established this approach to track neuromodulatory composition across
hours or days and across behavioral states (Aim 1), we will use closed-loop delivery methods to control dynamic
patterns of up to a dozen neuromodulatory signals in the brain in awake mice and evaluate which patterns drive
behavioral preference or avoidance (Aim 2).These experiments benefit from the use of fluorescence lifetime and
well as fluorescence intensity measurements, allowing quantitative assessment of fluid composition across
extended periods of time (hours to days) with minimal effects of bleaching. Together, these tools offer a novel,
holistic framework for the study and control of multiple neuromodulators in the brain. The sensitive,
real-time, multiplexed readout of signals in small volumes complements microdialysis and enables
closed-loop control with applications to most domains of basic and clinical neuroscience research."
10931751,"Every hour, over 150 people die of hepatitis-related liver diseases in African countries like Nigeria, including
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other liver cancers. Much of this death is attributable to the hepatitis B
virus (HBV). A hepatitis B birth dose (HepB-BD) vaccine initiated within 24 hours of birth, followed by three
additional pentavalent HBV vaccines (at six, 10, and 14 weeks after birth), provide durable immunity,
substantially decreasing the risk of HBV and liver cancer. Nigerian national guidelines recommend HepB-BD
vaccination for all newborns and provides them for free as part of the national immunization protocol, yet
uptake is suboptimal, highlighting the need for implementation science research to develop locally relevant
strategies to increase HepB-BD vaccine uptake. We propose a crowdsourcing approach to enhance timely
coverage of HepB-BD vaccination in Nigeria. Crowdsourcing has a group of people solve all or part of a
problem, then implement selected solutions. Our team used crowdsourcing to develop messages promoting
HBV testing uptake, inform global hepatitis guidelines, and enhance hepatitis community engagement in low
and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our study will focus on developing and implementing strategies to
increase HepB-BD vaccination at community clinics, home births, and other sites outside of hospitals where
most pregnant women receive care. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science Research
(CFIR) and concept mapping will guide our evaluation of factors influencing uptake and sustainment.
Our specific aims are: 1) To determine pregnant women's preferences on HepB-BD vaccination using
community-engaged crowdsourcing research and finalize an implementation strategy to increase HepB-BD
vaccination; 2) To determine the effectiveness of a finalized crowdsourced HepB-BD vaccination intervention
among a cohort of pregnant women using a community-based clinic-level cluster RCT. Trained community
health workers will implement the final intervention in a cluster randomized control trial of the crowdsourced
intervention versus standard care (i.e. printed guidelines) among a cohort of 720 dyads (pregnant women and
newborns) at 36 community-based clinics (n=1440); and 3) To use mixed methods research to determine
multi-level factors that influence uptake and sustainment of crowdsourced HepB-BD vaccination over time.
Primary outcome is HepB-BD vaccination ascertained by clinic records. Secondary outcome is service
sustainment at the community-based clinic level, defined here as the percent sustainment of core elements of
the final campaign measured 12 months after the trial, with sustained benefits and capacity for implementation
at each community-based clinic. Our study is responsive to the U54 request for applications for global
implementation science for equitable cancer control and and the strategic priorities of the National Cancer
Institute. This study will provide a unique opportunity to expand HBV vaccine coverage, driving equitable
implementation science research in settings traditionally under-represented in implementation science."

 Last year in the United States, there were 1.3 million cases of pneumonia (excluding
covid19). Worldwide, last year, there were 49 million cases respectively. Even after successful
therapy, pneumonia and other severe infections are associated with >3-fold increased mortality
risk due to increased cardiovascular disease, cancer, and recurrent infections.
 Preliminary evidence by our group and others have demonstrated that these severe
infections induce detrimental premature epigenetic scars that accelerate age-associated
epigenetic perturbations and induce pathologic inflammation and decrease immune
responsiveness. While other studies have identified post-infectious premature aging, this study
will be the first to identify which post-infectious premature aging epigenetic scars are associated
with post-infectious mortality, inflammation and decreased immune responsiveness.
 We previously identified that post-infectious detrimental epigenetic scars last at least 6
months. Studies with longer-term follow up have confirmed these epigenetic scars are still
present 82 weeks after resolution of the original insult. Therefore, we will follow participants with
severe pneumonia for 24-months after completion of successful therapy and make use of
cutting-edge single cell sequencing to clarify how these detrimental scars are persistently
propagated.
 Our preliminary in vitro data demonstrates that infection induced premature epigenetic
aging and immune perturbations can be mitigated by drugs that inhibit the TCA cycle such as
metformin, everolimus, and metformin. This study will implement mechanistic studies to explore
how inhibitors of the TCA can be used to alleviate post-infectious premature epigenetic scars
and restore immune responsiveness."

With widespread resistance of malaria parasites to older agents, artemisinin-based combination therapies are
the mainstay for antimalarial treatment, but efficacy is threatened by resistance to artemisinins and partner
drugs. New antimalarial drugs are needed. Spearheaded by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), a
robust pipeline of new lead antimalarial compounds is under development. However, resistance to new agents
can be anticipated. In a number of cases drug targets and resistance mechanisms have been identified, but
studies have focused on small numbers of P. falciparum laboratory strains. It is critical also to consider
sensitivity to lead antimalarials of fresh P. falciparum field isolates, especially isolates from Africa. With these
data, genotypic and additional phenotypic analysis can allow identification of mechanisms underlying varied
susceptibility, as we have described for multiple compounds to date, informing optimal development of next-
generation combination antimalarials. This application seeks continued funding for a project characterizing
susceptibilities of malaria parasites isolated in Uganda and Burkina Faso to lead antimalarials under
development. We offer state-of-the-art assessment of ex vivo P. falciparum susceptibilities linked to high
throughput genotypic characterization to improve our understanding of mechanisms of drug action and
resistance. As supported by data generated to date, we hypothesize that African P. falciparum isolates will
demonstrate varied sensitivity to lead antimalarial compounds, and that characterization of genotypes and
phenotypes of field isolates will identify shared resistance mechanisms and guide selection of optimal
combination therapies. These results will be of great value as we develop next-generation combination
antimalarials and continue efforts toward discovery of additional novel compounds. Our specific aims will be:
(1) to characterize ex vivo susceptibilities to lead antimalarial compounds of P. falciparum field isolates, (2) to
characterize genotypes to identify mediators of decreased susceptibility in field isolates to lead antimalarial
compounds, and (3) to characterize phenotypes of drug sensitivity outliers to elucidate mechanisms of
resistance of lead antimalarial compounds. Our studies will define resistance mechanisms for the most
important new compounds under development as antimalarials and inform choices of optimal antimalarial drug
combinations and the direction of continued drug discovery efforts."
10844639,"Project Summary. The human immune system participates in complex interactions with virtually all other
systems in the body. In particular, the B cell component of the adaptive immune response plays a role in
various disease settings, including infectious disease, cancer, autoimmunity, cardiovascular, hematologic,
neurologic diseases, and others. In addition, antibodies (a product of B cells) are effectively used in
diagnostics, therapy, and prevention. Yet, despite decades of antibody discovery efforts, there is still very
limited data linking human antibody sequence to antigen specificity (the preferential recognition of target
antigens by a given antibody). One of the major reasons for such limited data is the fact that even high-
throughput antibody sequence identification methods such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) of B cell
receptor (BCR) sequences are generally decoupled from the process of antibody functional characterization.
As a result, even though there are typically thousands to millions of antibody sequences within a single NGS
dataset, functional information is obtained only for a handful of antibodies against not more than 2-3 target
antigens at a time. To address these significant challenges for current technologies for B cell characterization
and antibody discovery, our group has been focusing on the development of a single-cell technology that, for a
given sample, enables the mapping of antibody sequence to antigen specificity from a single high-throughput
experiment for a large number of antigens and B cells at a time. The technology, LIBRA-seq (LInking B-cell
Receptor to Antigen specificity through sequencing), involves physically mixing a B cell sample with a
(theoretically unlimited) pool of DNA-barcoded antigens, thus transforming B cell-antigen binding into a
“sequenceable event”. In essence, LIBRA-seq offers all of the following features: (a) Characterization of
thousands to tens of thousands of B cells at a time, at the single-cell level; (b) Screening against a large
number of antigens at a time; (c) For each B cell, determination of the paired heavy-light chain BCR sequence;
(d) For each B cell, generation of a high-resolution antigen specificity map. We initially validated LIBRA-seq in
proof-of-concept studies in the context of HIV-1, and subsequently coronavirus, infection. These initial studies
lay the foundation for generalizing the LIBRA-seq technology for application toward diverse antigen targets,
and highlight areas for technology optimization, which will be the focus of this technology development
proposal. In particular, here we propose to optimize LIBRA-seq for generalized application toward a broad
diversity of antigen targets.
 Ultimately, the LIBRA-seq technology will have a long-lasting impact on both basic and applied
immunology, helping revolutionize our understanding of antibody-antigen interactions and leading to the
discovery of novel antibody therapeutics targeting a large variety of disease areas of biomedical significance."
10893619,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT.
O6-Methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) reverts O6-alkylguanosine residues to guanosine via dealkylation
by SN2 displacement. MGMT is ubiquitously expressed in healthy tissue but is silenced (referred to as “MGMT–
“) in ~50% of glioblastomas (GBMs), most gliomas, and in up to 40% of colon cancers, 35% of small cell lung
cancers, and 25% of non-small cell lung cancers. MGMT– tumors are sensitized to DNA alkylation agents, such
as temozolomide (TMZ). This sensitization creates a therapeutic index (TI). TMZ prolongs survival of patients
with MGMT– GBM by ~8 mo. The cytotoxicity of TMZ relies on an intact DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway.
MMR silencing (referred to as “MMR–”) is the primary mechanism of acquired TMZ resistance, and second-line
therapies are ineffective. Despite >20 y of research, efforts to overcome MMR silencing-based resistance have
not been successful. Herein, we present 2-fluoroethylating agents (FEtAs) as novel, orally bioavailable com-
pounds that selectively eradicate MGMT–/MMR– GBM in vivo, without systemic toxicity. Our data indicate FEtAs
induce DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs) only in MGMT– tumors by formation of O6-(2-fluoroethyl)guanosine
(O6FEtG), slow cyclization to an N1,O6-ethanoguanine (EG) intermediate, and ring-opening by the adjacent
cytosine. The slow rates of EG formation provide time for MGMT to reverse the initial alkylation in healthy (e.g.,
MGMT+) cells, leading to a high TI. In contrast, chloroethylation agents, such as mitozolomide, generate O6-(2-
chloroethyl)guanosine (O6ClEtG), which cyclizes to EG competitively with MGMT reversal. This leads to the
formation of ICLs or toxic DNA–MGMT cross-links, via opening of EG by MGMT, in healthy cells. Additionally,
the chloroethylsulfide formed on MGMT reversal of O6ClEtG converts to a reactive episulfonium ion, which also
cross-links MGMT to DNA, while MGMT reversal of O6FEtG creates a stable fluoroethylsulfide. Together, these
differences lend a higher MGMT TI to FEtAs suggesting they are likely to display improved tolerability in humans.
Since ICL toxicity is MMR-independent, FEtAs retain activity in TMZ-resistant, MMR– tumors. Here we will study
the amount of O6FEtG formed from FEtAs and the rate of its reversal by MGMT. We will characterize the structure
and reaction kinetics of the ICLs using oligonucleotides containing a single O6FEtG. We will conduct studies to
improve FEtA CNS penetration. We will probe for synergy between FEtAs and DDR inhibitors, other DNA repair
deficiencies, and radiotherapy. Completion of this research will lead to the identification of novel chemotherapies
with high CNS penetration that operate by a novel, MMR-independent mechanism, thereby addressing acquired
TMZ resistance. As FEtAs are structurally-related to TMZ, we expect rapid translation to the clinic. MGMT is
silenced in a range of tumor types; this work will set the stage to evaluate FEtAs as treatments for other MGMT–
tumors, alone or in combination regimes. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, the relative rates of DNA chemical
modification and repair have not previously been exploited to obtain tumor specificity; we believe this “kinetic
lethal” strategy may constitute the first iteration of a new approach to targeted chemotherapeutic design."

Learning and memory involve multiple brain areas. However, the hippocampus (CA1) and ventral tegmental area
(VTA) are the brain regions primarily involved in novelty detection and context discrimination. Abnormal
connection between these brain regions leads to deficits in novelty behavior. For decades, the function of the
VTA-CA1 circuit in learning, and the dysregulation of midbrain neurotransmitter systems in diseases like
schizophrenia, depression, and addictions have been attributed (primarily) to the dopamine neurons. Because
of this traditional focus on the midbrain dopaminergic systems, the glutamate pathway has been overlooked and
is less understood in normal brain function and neuropsychiatric disorders. In a recent study, we showed that
the VTA glutamate terminals are anatomically dominant in the CA1 while VTA dopamine terminals were limited
to the basal dendrite layer. Functional tracing of the VTA-CA1 pathway shows that selective activation of VTA
glutamate and dopamine neurons has distinguishable effects on CA1 local circuits. Photostimulation of VTA
glutamate – but not the dopamine – neurons increased burst firing of CA1 pyramidal cells. Likewise, stimulation
of the VTA glutamate pathway increased putative pyramidal cells (PYR) excitation of interneurons (INT) in CA1
ensembles. In freely behaving mice, novelty detection tasks that activate the VTA-CA1 circuit increased CA1
PYR/INT connectivity while its inhibition altered novelty-linked behavior. Based on preliminary results, the
proposed research will elucidate the functional significance of the VTA glut→CA1 tract in the hippocampal
encoding of novelty-dependent behavior including context discrimination and habituation. The results of the
proposed research will increase our understanding of VTA excitatory modulation of cognitive processes and
control of adaptive behavior."

 Tumor growth and response to therapy, particularly immunotherapy, are all highly dependent on the tumor
microenvironment (TME): the collection of cells and extracellular factors (cytokines, chemokines, collagens, etc.)
that form around cancer cells. This is evident from the major impact drugs targeting TME components can have
on cancers, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Though there is a relatively good understanding of
key genes regulating cancer cell intrinsic processes, such as cell cycle, there is less known about genes
controlling the extrinsic environment that protects cancer cells from immunity and aids growth.
 The objective of this project is to determine the genes controlling tumor composition and facilitating tumor
growth and resistance to immunity & immunotherapy, with the goal of identifying vulnerability factors that can
be targeted to enhance tumor immunity and improve cancer treatment. The overarching hypothesis, which
forms the rationale for this U01, is that malignant cells turn on or off genes, including intrinsically operating genes,
through mutations and selective gene expression, that act extrinsically to recruit, position, & polarize immune &
stroma cells into a state that subverts immunity & facilitates tumor growth1, 2. To reach our objective, we will
employ a first-of-its-kind spatial functional genomics platform, called Perturb-map, which permits extensive
phenotypic analysis of dozens of single or multiple gene perturbations in a tumor at single cell resolution and
with spatial architecture preserved. With Perturb-map, CRISPR knockout (KO) or cDNA overexpression (OE)
screens are resolved by multiplex imaging & spatial transcriptomics (ST), and this allows study of entire classes
of genes (e.g. secreted factors) and phenotypes (e.g. TME composition) not feasible with existing screens.
 We will use Perturb-map to determine the role of 100s of genes in controlling many critical tumor processes,
including tumor: (i) growth, (ii) morphology, (iii) metastasis, (iv) cell-cell interactions, (v) subclonal interactions,
(vi) immune/stroma recruitment & polarization, (vii) resistance to immunotherapy & other treatments. The breadth
& depth of analysis of each gene will be achieved at a scale and efficiency not previously feasible. We will focus
on 3 broad categories of genes, identified through analysis of TCGA, ICB-treated cohorts, single cell-omics, and
other patient data, including: commonly mutated cancer genes in solid tumors (Aim 1), genes correlating with
resistance or response to ICB immunotherapy (Aim 2), and cancer cell-derived ligands and secreted molecules
(Aim 3). Studies will be carried out in immunocompetent, orthotopic models of non-small cell lung carcinoma,
high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and oral squamous cell carcinoma.
 The study outcome will determine the roles of 100s of genes in many processes critical to unimpeded cancer
growth, including identifying genes shielding cancers from immunity. In doing so, they will generate insights into
mechanisms of aggressive tumor behavior and treatment resistance that will help to improve and personalize
treatment selection and drive the immediate next steps towards the development of novel therapeutic strategies."

Instead of conferring protection, IgG antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) have been correlated with
increased susceptibility to symptomatic dengue disease, as patients with pre-existing antibodies against DENV
experience at a higher rate the symptomatic form of dengue disease, which often includes life-threatening
complications. With over 2.5 billion people being at risk of DENV infection and with >100 million new infections
occurring annually, DENV represents a tremendous burden to global human public health, necessitating the
development of efficacious therapeutic or vaccination approaches to control DENV infection and disease. Using
in vitro cellular assays, several studies have previously suggested that anti-DENV antibodies can mediate
enhanced viral infection of Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-expressing myeloid cells; a phenomenon referred to as antibody
dependent enhancement (ADE). However, ADE of viral replication alone cannot account for the complex
pathophysiological features of symptomatic dengue disease, as well as for the wide spectrum of clinical disease
severity observed among symptomatic patients. During the previous funding period, in collaborative studies with
the Institute Pasteur in Cambodia, a DENV endemic area, we demonstrated that dengue disease susceptibility,
as well as disease severity are associated with the induction of specific glycoforms of IgG antibodies
(afucosylated) that exhibit increased affinity for the activating FcγRIII receptor. In parallel mechanistic studies,
we developed a novel in vivo model of dengue disease that expresses the full array of human FcγRs and is
permissive for DENV infection. Using this model, we demonstrated that a critical step in the in vivo pathogenesis
of dengue disease is the engagement of FcγRIIIa on macrophages by afucosylated IgG antibodies, which are
enriched in severe dengue cases. FcγRIIIa-afucosylated IgG antibody interactions result in aberrant macrophage
activation, inflammatory sequelae, significant morbidity, and mortality. These findings implicate the FcγRIIIa-
afucosylated Fc axis as the basis for dengue disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. Using a unique set of
biospecimens from DENV-infected patients, as well as our recently developed mouse models of ADE of dengue
disease, the proposed studies aim to (i) dissect the mechanisms that drive the induction of IgG Fc afucosylated
glycoforms upon DENV infection and (ii) characterize the downstream effector responses that are initiated upon
engagement of FcγRIIIa by afucosylated IgG antibodies and contribute to disease pathogenesis. We anticipate
that our findings will significantly advance our understanding of the pathways that regulate IgG Fc glycan
heterogeneity during DENV infection and drive dengue disease pathogenesis, having a broader impact on the
study of immune responses against other viral pathogens that are characterized by aberrant IgG Fc fucosylation."

Hematopoietic Stem Cells (HSCs) produce all cells of the blood lineage throughout life. Defects in HSC self-
renewal can lead to immunological defects, anemia, and bone marrow failure. Enhanced HSC self-renewal can
result in hematopoietic malignancies. Thus, precise regulation of HSC self-renewal is essential for maintaining
hematopoietic and human health. Our previous work has shown that adult HSCs tightly control protein synthesis
and that modest changes in protein synthesis impair HSC self-renewal and function. However, the mechanisms
that regulate mRNA translation in HSCs remain largely unknown. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are non-coding
adaptor RNAs critical for mRNA translation that are encoded by hundreds of genes in the mammalian genome,
with multiple functional genes capable of decoding virtually every codon. We previously showed that the tRNA
repertoire influences neuronal function but the effect of changes in tRNA expression on hematopoietic cells is
unknown. In preliminary studies, we found that loss of n-Tr22, a member of the five gene arginine UCU tRNA
family significantly impairs HSC maintenance and self-renewal, and this is exacerbated in a sensitized genetic
background lacking the ribosome rescue factor Gtpbp2, resulting in a complete loss of adult, but not fetal HSCs.
We hypothesize that the sensitivity of adult HSCs to the n-Tr22 mutation may be due to differences in the tRNA
repertoire between adult HSCs and restricted progenitors, and between HSCs at different developmental stages.
The impact of tRNA mutations may be further influenced by differential codon usage in the transcriptome of these
cell populations. Finally, there may be cell-type-specific differences in the signaling pathways activated by loss
of a tRNA. We propose to test this hypothesis by using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing to
determine the tRNA repertoire in the hematopoietic system. We will also analyze how this tRNA mutation
influences the maintenance and function of HSCs in the presence and absence of the Gtpbp2 mutation using
flow cytometry and long-term multilineage reconstitution assays. Finally, we will determine the effects of the loss
of n-Tr22 and Gtpbp2 on protein synthesis and gene expression by incorporation of a puromycin analog,
ribosome profiling, and RNA-sequencing. The results from this grant will not only shed light on the role of tRNAs
in regulating mRNA translation in the hematopoietic system, but also provide a means to understand the role of
these genes in the phenotypic heterogeneity common to many human hematopoietic disorders."
10916503,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Structural biology plays a central role in modern molecular bioscience, enabling both a greater
understanding and new mechanisms of manipulation of biomolecular action. However, despite tremendous
development in tools for the generation of high resolution molecular models, large families of biomolecules and
biomolecular complexes are still poorly represented in databases of protein structure due to limitations of
current technology, and methods for probing protein structure within mammalian tissue are few. One method
that has been used successfully to qualitatively study the structure of several of these families is hydroxyl
radical protein footprinting (HRPF), an emerging technology that has been used to study changes in protein
topography by measuring changes in the apparent rate of reaction between hydroxyl radicals generated in situ
and amino acid side chains on the protein surface. Our initial work has developed HRPF into a quantitative
measurement of protein topography at the individual amino acid level, accurately measuring the average
solvent accessible surface areas (<SASA>) of many individual amino acids in a single experiment. In this
renewal, we will expand our technology into structural systems that change dynamically with time, including
protein posttranslational modification systems, large heteromeric protein complexes, and protein:carbohydrate
complexes. The core technology we will develop to enable these studies is high performance liquid
chromatography coupled inline with amino acid resolution HRPF (LC-HR-HRPF). Inline liquid chromatography
allows the separation of protein conformers and immediate quantitative measurement of the purified
conformers’ topographies by HR-HRPF before the dynamic system has a chance to re-equilibrate, freezing the
structural information in the stable chemical footprint. We will also develop technology for analysis of protein
structure within mammalian whole blood, enabling the study of protein structure and interactions within highly
complex native systems. We will develop flow systems to precisely and carefully deliver hydrogen peroxide to
blood for protein labeling without damaging cells, and will demonstrate the technology with the structural
analysis of monoclonal antibodies dosed into a mouse model. Finally, we will develop technologies to probe
the topography of complex carbohydrates, enabling us to measure which parts of carbohydrates mediate
interactions with proteins, even in complex mixtures of glycans. We will develop both reducing-end specific and
non-specific labeling strategies for probing carbohydrate topography. Together, these advances represent
potential transforming technologies for the structural analysis of biomedically important and highly challenging
systems."

Stem cell theory states that all the blood cells are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and is a central
concept of hematology and immunology. Bone marrow transplant therapy for blood disorders is rooted in the
concept that donor HSCs can replace all blood cells in the recipient's body. However, recent research has
challenged the stem cell theory by showing that some tissue-resident immune cells develop from endothelial
cells (EC) of the embryo in an HSC-independent manner and these immune cells may not be replaced by HSCs.
Furthermore, it has been reported that a significant percentage of conventional B cells (B-2 cells) also originate
from fetal EC progenitors in the embryo and persist into old mice. These striking results highlight a huge
knowledge gap in the hematology and immunology fields because HSC-independent B-2 cell development has
yet to be recognized. Since B cells play important roles in protecting against infections and in the pathology of
autoimmune and other diseases, it is critically important to understand the developmental pathways of HSC-
independent B-cells and their functions compared to HSC-derived counterparts. However, it is challenging to
clarify the origins of these B-cells since there are multiple waves of hematopoiesis from ECs in the embryo, in
which HSCs and HSC-independent blood progenitors seem to be produced simultaneously. Our preliminary data
and other studies suggest that there are at least three waves of B-cell development; 1) innate-immune B-1 cell
development, 2) common progenitors for innate B-1 and conventional B-2 cells, and 3) B-2 dominant progenitors
derived from HSCs. Our objective is to determine the functional differences of B-cells based on their origins and
to establish a revised B-cell development map from embryo to adult, using combinations of various lineage
tracing and in vivo barcoding mouse models. To pursue these goals, Aim 1 will utilize HSC-labeling mice (100%
labeling of HSCs is achieved) and the HSC-derived lymphoid cell depletion model so that HSC-independent and
dependent B-cell subsets will be separated. Then, these HSC-independent and dependent B-cell subsets will
be sorted and examined for 1) antibody and cytokine secretion, class switching upon in vitro stimulation, and
their IgM repertoire, 2) in vivo repsonse to S. pneumoniae infection, and 3) response to pneumococcal
vaccination. In Aim 2, preliminary data identified the earliest innate-immune restricted B-progenitors in the early
fetal liver. Also, scRNA-sequencing of the neonatal spleen revealed three separate B-progenitor clusters,
supporting our hypothesis. Thus, the EC-lineage tracing mouse model that can mark HSC-independent blood
progenitors will be combined with in vivo barcoding, which will enable visualization of the clonal relationships
between HSCs and fetal- and HSC-derived B-progenitors. The results obtained from this proposal will revise the
current paradigm of B-cell development and will be utilized to understand pathology not previously recognized
in the absence of recognizing the existance of various fetal-derived B cell subsets."
10861919,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are crucial for understanding the impact of cochlear implants (CIs)
on real-world functional abilities and for monitoring changes over time. However, CI clinical outcome measures
traditionally focus solely on CI users’ speech recognition ability, which lacks ecological validity, relies on
outcomes that are weakly associated with real-world functional communication ability, and disregards important
CI benefits such as improved social engagement and listening effort. Therefore, our current clinical practice
standards are not evidence based due to a critical knowledge gap that limits our understanding of the broad
functional impact of CIs on patients’ everyday lives. Improvement in speech recognition represents a
fundamental early step in the post-CI rehabilitation process. Further lasting real-world functional improvements
may occur but depend on how well CI users deploy their enhanced speech recognition skills in their everyday
lives. This two-phase process emphasizes the value of combining PROMs with measures of speech recognition
to comprehensively assess the patient-centered benefits of cochlear implantation. The enhanced rigor of modern
PROM development methodologies, as applied in the development and validation of the new Cochlear Implant
Quality of Life-35 Profile (CIQOL-35 Profile), have the potential to improve the monitoring of CI user progress
and inform clinical decision making. The proposed project includes a rigorous evaluation of the benefits of CIs
on a broad range of functional abilities conducted using a multi-site, longitudinal study design, which will provide,
for the first time, a comprehensive understanding of outcomes meaningful to patients and accomplish the
following Aims. Aim 1 will apply a novel CIQOL functional staging system, which provides real-world context to
CIQOL scores while maintaining the hierarchy of quantitative scores, in a group-based trajectory model to identify
clusters of patients in the longitudinal study who follow similar progressions through the CIQOL functional staging
system and identify patient factors associated with each trajectory cluster. Aim 2 will first determine the
magnitude of change in CIQOL-35 Profile scores considered clinically meaningful to CI users, then apply these
findings to better understand the association between early meaningful improvement after implantation and long-
term functional outcomes. Specifically, we aim to promptly identify patients at risk of poorer long-term outcomes
who may benefit from additional resources. Finally, Aim 3 will apply an implementation science approach to
translate the findings from our longitudinal study into clinical practice and enhance the integration of CIQOL
instruments into routine CI care. Together, the proposed research program will enhance the interpretation and
application of real-world CI outcomes for individual patients, inform patient discussions regarding expected
results and demonstrate the potential for PROMs to personalize and improve patient care."
10895560,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) develop progressive and highly distressing
symptoms of social and emotional dysfunction, including loss of empathy for other people. Scientific research
has struggled to understand the specific causes of empathy loss in bvFTD because empathy is difficult to
measure in a way that is meaningful and not biased by other factors, such as caregiver burden, and because
individuals with bvFTD have highly variable patterns of cognitive and behavioral functioning. A relatively
unexplored but promising avenue of scientific inquiry is the role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in
empathy loss in bvFTD. The ANS is comprised of two complementary subsystems, the sympathetic and
parasympathetic nervous systems, which operate together to increase and decrease levels of physiologic
arousal in response to cues from the environment. Patients with bvFTD show subtle abnormalities in ANS
activity that are linked to symptoms of social dysfunction, including loss of empathy, but this line of research
has been hindered by reliance on traditional methods of measuring ANS output, namely hard-wired EKG and
skin conductance sensors, which restrict the movement of the patient and are sensitive to motion artifacts.
Recent advances in wearable smartwatch technology allow for precise, unobtrusive measurement of ANS
activity with built-in motion detectors to account for changes in ANS signals that are due to movement.
Smartwatch technology is well-suited for continuous measurement of ANS functioning to detect subtle
abnormalities that correspond to behavioral measures of empathy in bvFTD. This project has the potential to
identify specific physiologic contributions to empathy loss in bvFTD, which can be used to develop new
treatments and improve early detection of social and emotional dysfunction in bvFTD."

Lack of transparency and trustworthiness of deep neural networks (DNNs) has long been recognized as a major
drawback of the technology, hindering its widespread acceptance in many practical applications. The objective
of this project is to establish a novel contrastive feature analysis (CFA) framework for reliable visualization of the
high dimensional feature space and effective design of high-performance DNNs for medical image analysis. We
hypothesize that CFA-based feature visualization will enable us to quantify the quality of the feature space at
different layers during training/testing of a DNN and empower us with an effective tool to prune the network
architecture for enhanced performance. Specifically, we will (1) develop an efficient visualization technique CFA
for high dimensional feature data, 2) apply the CFA visualization framework to automatically refine DNN
architecture for improved performance, and 3) demonstrate the potential of CFA in solving clinical
problems. Successful completion of the project will enable us to analyze the feature data reliably and quantify
the quality of the feature space at different layers of a DNN. The study also promises to provide high-performance
DNNs for medical image analysis to substantially improve the AI-based diagnosis, prognosis and treatment
planning of different diseases."
10726486,"This project focuses on the problem of breast cancer metastasis and recurrence, and on a novel signaling
pathway that is positioned to modulate both. The key signaling molecule is the β1 subunit of soluble guanylate
cyclase (sGC), an enzyme that normally functions as a heterodimer composed of α1 and β1 subunits (termed
here sGCα1 and sGCβ1). In biological models, sGCβ1, but not sGCα1, can translocate into the nucleus, where
it regulates expression of p53 and specific cyclin dependent protein kinases and induces G0/G1 phase arrest.
Moreover sGCβ1, but not sGCα1, markedly inhibits proliferation and colony formation of human cancer cell lines,
and lengthens survival time of orthotropic implanted mice over control. In human breast cancer patients, levels
of sGCβ1 (but not sGCα1) directly correlate with patient survival in authentic breast cancer patients (n =1664).
The hypothesis that altered expression of sGCβ1 in tumor stroma (including epithelial cells, immune cells, and
vascular endothelial cells) alters responses to niche signals and modulates breast cancer recurrence will be
tested by (1) interrogating the effects of sGCβ1 expression on circulating tumor cell (CTC) cluster formation, (2)
examining the role of sGCβ1 expression in modulating breast cancer recurrence arising from angiogenic
dormancy, and (3) determining the ability of sGCβ1-targeted histone deacetylase signaling to reverse immune
dysfunction. Successfully completed, this project will validate the importance of sGCβ1-targeted HDAC signaling
against recurrence of dormant breast cancer, and point the field toward new therapeutic strategies for treating
metastatic breast cancer."

The scientific premise of this Center is that breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid models
represent the diversity of human breast tumors, and can be feasibly utilized to test new drugs and drug
combinations to find therapeutic approaches that match with molecular features of various tumor types. Our
PDTC is focused on identifying new treatment strategies for breast cancer, which remains the 2nd leading cause
of cancer death in women. We will conduct preclinical evaluation of drugs and drug combinations in models
selected from our large collection of 261 breast PDX models and >100 stable PDxO lines representing primary,
metastatic, and treatment-resistant breast cancers from diverse patient populations (25% of the collection is from
racial/ethnic minorities, with plans to increase that proportion in Aim 1 of both research projects). The Center
comprises two highly integrated Research Projects that are designed together to combat the two most difficult
problems contributing to breast cancer deaths: breast cancer recurrence, and treatment of recurrent/metastatic
disease. More than 90% of breast cancer deaths are attributed to disease recurrence as incurable metastatic disease.
Project 1 is focused on improving therapy for early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), to prevent
recurrence and achieve durable cures by identifying optimal chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations
based on molecular features of tumors. Project 2 aims to identify more effective regimens in disease that does
recur (treatment-resistant, metastatic disease) by utilizing our unique collection of PDX and PDxO from
metastatic samples. These two complementary research projects will be supported by a PDX Core, a
Bioinformatics Core, a Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core that fosters exploration of new ideas
within the PDTC and in collaboration with the PDXNetwork (PDXNet), and an Administrative Core that provides
project oversight and management, and facilitates effective communication within the PDTC and the PDXNet.
The overarching goal of our PDX Development and Trials Center (PDTC) is to obtain preclinical data that will
facilitate prioritization of drugs to be tested in breast cancer clinical trials at the National Cancer Institute (NCI)."

10732753,"Long-term exposure to arsenic, esp. the inorganic trivalent arsenic (iAs), a human carcinogen that
occurs naturally in the earth's crust or work place due to industrial settings, has been linked to various
types of cancers, esp. lung cancer. It has been known for decades that multiple different mechanisms
might be involved in iAs-induced malignant transformation. However, whether and how iAs induces
cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) from non-stem cells hadn’t been studied. We had previously shown that
consecutive treatment of the human bronchial epithelial cells with 0.125 to 0.25 M (~9 to 18ppb) iAs
for six months induced generation of the CSCs. In addition to the higher expression of the stemness
circuit genes, including Oct4, Sox2, myc, Klf4, etc., these iAs-induced CSCs also exhibited a unique
metabolic pattern featured with an active glycolysis and diminished mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). ChIP-seq analysis of the parental cells and the iAs-induced CSCs
revealed a substantial increase in the enrichment of histone H3 lysine4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an
active epigenetic marker for gene transcription, among genes critical for the stemness and glycolysis
of the CSCs. To understand how iAs induces these metabolic and epigenetic changes and the
generation of the CSCs, we recently also investigated the capability of iAs on the activation of Nrf2 and
HIF1 signaling through both biochemical and ChIP-seq approaches. The data indicate that Nrf2 and
HIF1 may serve as initiators for the metabolic and epigenetic reprograming, and the acquisition of the
CSC features. Accordingly, we hypothesize that iAs-activated Nrf2 is an upstream activator for HIF1
signaling linked to glycolysis, and the subsequent epigenetic reprogramming and generation of the
CSCs. To test this hypothesis, the following three specific aims will be pursued: Aim1, dissecting Nrf2
activation pathways with an emphasis on the iAs-induced ubiquitination and degradation of Keap1, the
endogenous inhibitor of Nrf2; Aim 2, investigating mechanisms of Nrf2-dependent initiation of HIF1
signaling in the cells in response to iAs; and Aim 3, understanding how iAs-induced Nrf2-HIF1
signaling shifts the metabolism from mitochondrial TCA cycle to glycolysis that linked to reprogramming
of the histone methylation profiles and the generation of CSCs. We expect that the data from the
completion of this research plan will be the first to reveal the importance of Nrf2 and HIF1 in iAs-
induced CSCs, which may be translated into new strategies of cancer therapy by targeting the Nrf2-
HIF1 signaling and the CSCs."

Nickel (Ni) compounds are environmental toxicants, prevalent in the atmosphere due to their use in several
industrial processes, as well as extensive consumption of Ni containing products such as stainless steel,
batteries, medical devices and medical implants. In addition, combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of Ni
contamination in the atmosphere. Exposure to Ni is a major human health hazard, associated with a multitude
of health risks including allergic contact dermatitis, bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.
Moreover, epidemiological studies indicate cancer development as a major outcome of Ni exposure. However,
the molecular basis of Ni-induced diseases remains poorly understood. To better understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying Ni-induced diseases, we investigated the effects of Ni-exposure on human epithelial
cells. Our studies show that Ni-exposure-induced gene expression changes persist long after the cessation of
exposure. This resulted in the cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the EMT
phenotype continued long after the termination of exposure. EMT is the process in which polarized epithelial
cells lose cell-cell adhesion and acquire invasive and migratory mesenchymal properties. EMT is implicated in a
number of diseases associated with Ni-exposure including asthma, fibrosis, cancer and metastasis. Therefore,
our results suggest that persistent transcriptional changes caused by Ni exposure are likely important in the
etiology of Ni-exposure associated diseases. The overarching goal of this grant is to understand the
mechanisms that drive long-term transcriptional changes caused by Ni exposure. Our preliminary results suggest
that Ni-exposure disrupts chromatin regulation mediated by the histone modification, H3K27me3 and the zinc
finger protein, CTCF. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Ni-exposure increases
chromatin accessibility through H3K27me3 loss, causing gene upregulation. CTCF binds the newly
accessible chromatin and prevents H3K27me3 re-establishment after termination of Ni-exposure,
thereby persistently altering gene expression. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of H3K27me3-loss in Ni-
induced persistent gene expression alterations in human lung epithelial cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
mechanisms underlying Ni-induced persistent chromatin alterations by knocking-down CTCF and by disrupting
CTCF binding sites using CRISPR/Cas9 system to examine if loss of CTCF binding could reverse Ni-induced
persistent transcriptional changes. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional outcome of Ni-induced persistent
transcriptional changes by investigating the tumor generating potential of Ni-exposed cells in in mice. The overall
impact of our study will be the identification of the mechanisms underlying long-term transcriptional changes
caused by nickel exposure, which will reveal the molecular basis of its pathogenicity, and will have major human
health implications."

The production and transport of cyanotoxins along the freshwater-to-marine continuum raises critical public
health concerns, especially for coastal populations that are more likely to be exposed to contaminated water and
seafood. Moreover, while cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins have been relatively well studied in freshwater lakes,
little is known about their distribution and persistence in coastal systems. Thus, the overarching objective of
Project 3, as an integral component of the North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae, People, and
Environment (NC C-CAPE), is to develop a comprehensive modeling framework that elucidates key controls
on toxin accumulation and provides predictive capabilities to help stakeholders protect human health. Through
leveraging diverse data and information sources within a probabilistic framework (Bayesian Network modeling),
Aim 1 of this research provides the predictive basis for estimating cyanotoxin risks from key
environmental covariates, like temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, and solar radiation. The resulting
models will enable prediction of cyanotoxin congener concentrations in water and oyster tissue, including the
risk of exceeding health advisory thresholds, even when only a subset of relevant covariates is available. While
Aim 1 is based largely on water quality data from specific monitoring locations, protecting public health requires
a predictive understanding of how cyanotoxins vary across space and time. To this end, Aim 2 will leverage
coastal circulation modeling and remote sensing to assess how key drivers of cyanobacteria and
cyanotoxins vary across the coastal North Carolina study area. By combining this information with probabilistic
relationships for cyanotoxin concentration (for example, the Bayesian Network from Aim 1), it will be possible
to map toxin risks across space, and under different hydrological conditions. This effort will also allow us to
determine the extent to which toxic cyanobacteria blooms are constrained to regions of freshwater inflow and
transport (e.g., river outlets), versus forming in-place at various points along the freshwater-to-marine continuum.
Finally, coastal systems are vulnerable to multiple dimensions of climate change, including sea level rise,
increasing temperatures, and changes in freshwater inflow. These factors, along with potential changes in
nutrient loading due to watershed development, will be investigated in the future scenarios of Aim 3. Aim 3 will
update the modeling approach described in Aim 2 with future system forcings to assess future cyanotoxin
distributions, including the likely overlap with viable oyster habitat. For each of the three aims, we will engage
with stakeholders to develop relevant predictive tools and risk mapping products, with the aim of protecting public
health by identifying high-risk conditions, and informing future management decisions regarding the protection
of coastal water quality."
10747452,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease characterized by extensive desmoplasia caused
by the rapid expansion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), resulting in the formation of dense stroma.
CAFs stimulate cancer progression by secreting a variety of factors that support cancer cells and facilitate
immunosuppression. In addition, they also secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) that provides survival and
invasion cues to cancer cells and impairs drug delivery. Recently, several populations of CAFs with distinct
functions have been characterized in PDA by our group and others using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA
seq). One population is characterized as myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), another population is characterized
as inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), the third population was first identified as antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs),
which express MHC II molecules and can effectively present antigen to T cells. My preliminary data
demonstrated that apCAFs are mesothelial cells. Mesothelial cells form a continuous layer of epithelial cells
known as mesothelium. The mesothelium is traditionally thought to be a membrane providing a non-adhesive
surface covering organs and tissues. However, until the description of apCAF population, mesothelial cells
have been neglected as a potential functional constituent of the tumor microenvironment. My preliminary data
suggest that during PDA progression, mesothelial cells go through a mesothelial-fibroblastic transition (MFT),
in which they down-regulate MHC II molecules that are required for CD4+ T cells activation, and up-regulate
fibroblast genes that have been known to prevent T cell infiltration and activation. Peripheral T cell exclusion is
a major immune evasion phenotype in PDA, and my preliminary data show that this exclusion occurs at the
region where mesothelial cells are transitioning to CAFs. Therefore, MFT might be an important mechanism of
immune evasion and understanding this process is critical. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that the
fibroblastic transition of mesothelial cells promotes immune evasion in PDA and identify potential
strategies to inhibit this process. I propose the following two aims: Aim 1. Determine the fate of mesothelial
cells during PDA progression. Aim 2. Determine the functions of MFT on immune evasion. The outcome
of the proposed study has the potential to shift the paradigm of tumor microenvironment studies, identify novel
strategies to target CAFs and overcome resistance of immune therapies in PDA and other tumor types."

Research Project: Excess body weight is a contributing factor in up to 20% of all cancer deaths in women. In
particular, endometrial cancer (EC) incidence has risen steadily over the past two decades concomitant with
the rise in global obesity rates. EC is a multifactorial disease, as both obesity and somatic driver mutations play
causal roles. Mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway are present in over 80% of all EC.
However, obesity or PI3K pathway mutation alone are insufficient for EC pathogenesis. A major gap in
knowledge is how genetic mutations alter EC risk in obese women, and evidence points towards impaired
protein quality control as an important causal mechanism. Obesity causes systemic endoplasmic reticulum
stress (ERS), which is triggered by the accumulation of unfolded proteins. If proteostasis cannot be achieved,
the unfolded protein response induces cell death. Due to increased aromatase activity, obesity creates an
“unopposed estrogen” phenotype, which drives EC and results in ERS in the uterus. The PI3K pathway
antagonizes ERS and may promote cell survival under these conditions. Here, I propose to study the casual
mechanistic relationship between obesity and PI3K pathway mutations in EC pathogenesis. My central
hypothesis is that obesity alone causes ERS in the normal uterus, resulting in cell death, but when a PI3K
pathway mutation occurs in the endometrium of obese women this stress response does not happen, resulting
in uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. In this application, I propose to 1) Determine the relationship between
PI3K mutation and ERS in the endometrium 2) Characterize the role of estrogen-induced ERS in EC 3)
Determine the role for metabolism-induced ERS in EC prevention. Career Goals: My career will be focused on
cancer research. In graduate school, I developed novel cancer therapeutics targeting nucleotide biosynthesis
under the guidance of Dr. Larry Matherly. As an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow in Dr. Ronald
Chandler’s lab, I uncovered the mechanism by which common somatic mutations in the endometrial epithelium
result in myometrial invasion in EC. My goal is to secure a tenure-track faculty position at a leading cancer
research institution, and to develop a research program exploring the relationship between obesity and
mutation in EC pathogenesis to identify targets for active preventative intervention. Career Development and
Environment: The K99/R00 award will secure the necessary time and training to develop my career as a
successful independent investigator. My mentors will be Drs. Ronald Chandler, Jose Teixeira and Victoria Bae-
Jump, experts in the field of gynecologic oncology. Activities planned will focus on gaining new expertise in
obesity research. Michigan State University and the Van Andel Research Institute are the ideal location for this
training, being home to many experts in gynecologic oncology, cancer metabolism, mouse modeling and
bioinformatics. The Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center will provide additional education and training
in the fields of metabolism and obesity research."

The overall objective of this study is to engineer a potent CAR T cell therapy for high grade glioma (HGG),
a subgroup of brain tumors for which outcomes remain poor. CAR T cell therapy is an innovative technology
based on adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells engineered to elicit a clinically effective and specific
immune response against tumor cells. Early clinical studies in HGG patients demonstrated safety of CAR T cell
therapy for brain tumors; yet, only limited benefits were observed. Lack of efficacy is most likely multifactorial
and include heterogenous antigen expression, limited homing to and penetration of tumors, T cell exhaustion
and limited persistence, as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, the
central hypothesis of this proposal is that optimized design and additional genetic modifications of CAR
T cells will improve their antitumor effects, and that these interventions will be evaluated in immune
competent mouse models that closely mimic human disease. Three interrelated research aims are proposed
to test this hypothesis and the rationale of each is outlined below. First, CAR design has to be optimized and
evaluated in immune competent glioma models. In Aim 1, I will generate CAR T cells containing different co-
stimulatory domains (CD28.ζ, 41BB.ζ, CD28.mutζ, and 41BB.mutζ), and compare their activity in vitro and in
vivo. Second, a genome wide screen in primary T cells has identified key regulators of T cell activation post T-
cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Identified genes belong to molecules that regulate cell cycle, proliferation, and
downstream TCR signaling including SOCS1, RASA2, or CBLB. In Aim 2, I will therefore explore if CRISPR-
Cas9 mediated silencing of Socs1, Rasa2, and/or Cblb enhances the effector functions of CAR T cells. The
independent Aim 3 will then explore a dual CAR targeting approach in which I will not only target glioma cells
but also immunosuppressive cells within the glioma microenvironment. These studies are focused on tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs), since they are abundantly present in gliomas and play a critical role in shaping
the TME. To support the feasibility of this project, I have adapted the well-established immune competent GL261
glioma model to study CAR T cell therapies targeting the relevant tumor antigen B7-H3, which is not only
expressed by GL261 cells but also in a broad range of pediatric and adult brain tumors. In addition, my
preliminary studies indicate that `prototype' B7- H3 CAR T-cells readily recognize and kill GL261 cells in vitro
and have antitumor activity in vivo, highlighting that the developed model is well suited for the proposed aims of
this project. State of the art technique will be used in all three Aims to not only study the function and in vivo fate
of CAR T-cells, but also their antitumor activity, and how CAR T-cells interact with glioma- infiltrating immune
cells. Completion of this study will define the most optimal CAR design that best controls HGG tumors and
persists longer in the context of inflammatory brain tumors. Additionally, results will illustrate if targeting TAMs
will overcome the suppressive effects of TME on B7-H3 CAR T cells."
10930090,"SUMMARY. This is a multi-PI application renewing the U24 Cooperative Agreement to sustain and expand the
NIA’s state-of-the-art Alzheimer Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC) responsible for conducting academic clinical
trials across the continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This ACTC will continue to leverage the depth and
breadth of AD clinical research teams at USC, Harvard, and the Mayo Clinic, as well as the considerable
experience of investigators at 35 expert AD trial sites. We aim to sustain the optimized infrastructure that
efficiently develops and conducts high quality NIH supported clinical trials in AD and related dementias, while
addressing the need for Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) by incorporating JEDI principles across
all consortium infrastructure, activities, and studies. Building on our first five years of experience, we will utilize
streamlined contracting processes, a centralized IRB with a specific focus on neurodegenerative diseases, and
incorporate state-of-the-art informatics and statistical analyses. We will effectively manage performance of
clinical trial sites, while identifying, mentoring and supporting new trial sites to improve access to clinical trials.
We will foster continued innovation in AD trial design, providing expertise on novel cognitive, imaging, and
biomarker outcomes to support future ACTC trial applications. We will evaluate promising exploratory
measures imbedded in our current trials, such as Tau PET imaging and computerized cognitive testing, and
work to incorporate these measures into a robust platform for future Proof of Concept (POC) trials to rapidly
assess signals of efficacy. The ACTC Coordinating Center will leverage the highly experienced teams in
Clinical Operations, Data Systems and Management, and Biostatistics at USC. The MRI Unit, led by Mayo,
and PET Unit, led by Harvard and UC Berkeley, will capitalize on unparalleled experience with multi-site
protocols through ADNI, the A4 Study, and multiple ongoing clinical trials. The Clinical Outcome Instrument
and Biomarkers Units will leverage world-class expertise from Mayo, Harvard, and USC to incorporate both
standard and novel outcome measures in future trial designs. The new IDEA-CT Unit will provide training and
leadership opportunities to young clinical investigators to facilitate continued innovation in trial design, and
catalyze the next generation of AD clinical trials.
The experts comprising this infrastructure provide the highest levels of expertise to design and conduct trials
across the full continuum of AD, from primary prevention initiatives to combination trials for advanced
symptomatic stages. We will build on our successes with public/private partnerships and continue to
strengthen our strategic alliances to conduct large scale trials, while also supporting novel approaches to
smaller investigator-initiated POC studies that will better inform Phase 3 decision-making. A program
facilitating the longitudinal follow up of clinical trial participants with site assistance for brain donation,
centralizing tissue banking and sharing is another key aim of the renewal."
10912421,"About 1.1 million firefighters (FFs; 350,000 professional or paid, 750,000 volunteers) protect
Americans, their households, businesses, highways, and wildlands, performing emergency
response despite significant risk to their own health and well-being. Even though FFs are
screened for mental health risk upon entry into the profession, a substantial minority develop
mental health problems during fire careers including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
problematic alcohol use, depression, and anxiety. As might be expected with elevated rates of
mental health conditions, suicide risk is a major concern among FFs. In sum, the occupational
stress of fire service contributes to the early mortality of FFs who die 2 years earlier than other
American males. It is imperative that FFs are equipped with more effective emotion regulation
skills upon entry into the profession to buffer against the varied stressors that they will face.
Waiting until mental health challenges emerge is a flawed approach. Barriers to mental health
treatment seeking for FFs are numerous; FFs would benefit most from training in emotion
regulation skills delivered by credible peers upon entry and socialization into the profession.
This would likely prevent substantial negative outcomes downstream while promoting resilience
and wellness. Training to prevent development of PTSD, alcohol misuse, and other commonly
co-occurring mental health challenges should be transdiagnostic, focusing on the underlying
mechanism of emotion regulation. The proposed project is the next logical step in our line of
research whose long-range goal is to translate significant scientific findings to prevent the
development of disabling mental health challenges in FFs. Our central hypothesis is that peer-
delivered Brief Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders (BUP),
delivered during the fire academy, will prevent the development of PTSD and related mental
health outcomes. We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare peer-
delivered BUP to peer-delivered psychoeducation regarding mental health (PSYED) to small
groups of FF trainees during the fire academy for preventing symptoms of PTSD, alcohol
misuse, depression, anxiety, and functional impairment over time in new FFs. We will test
whether changes in neuroticism and emotion regulation mediate the effect of BUP on the
outcomes. This would be the first RCT of a mental health prevention intervention in FF recruits,
an important but understudied group with frequent trauma exposure and the first delivered by
peers. If successful, this approach would provide a culturally competent, scalable approach to
promoting resilience, thereby preventing work-related psychological injuries."
10909333,"Small molecule detection is central in many biological, medical, and legal domains,
including basic research, clinical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and workplace drug
testing, among other applications. The most widely deployed diagnostics are
immunoassay-based that utilize antibodies raised against ligand-protein conjugates. These
easy-to-use assays enable applications as diverse as point-of-care diagnostics, in-home
testing, and real-time environmental monitoring in the field. Although small molecule
immunoassays are powerful, they are time-consuming and costly to develop because analogs
of target molecules suitable for conjugation to immunogenic carrier proteins must be
chemically synthesized. New methods that enable the routine creation of small molecule
sensors using native molecules would radically increase the speed and decrease the costs
required to develop new diagnostic tests. The proposed work addresses this by building a
technology that will make developing new small molecule biosensors as easy and reliable as
developing new antibodies. We will accomplish this using a versatile new sensing scaffold –
the plant abscisic acid receptor PYR1. This receptor participates in chemical-induced
dimerization with its binding partner, HAB1. We recently described a directed evolution
pipeline for creating PYR1/HAB1 dimerization (PAIR) sensors and have created sensors for
116 small molecules, including Δ9-THC, 20 FDA-approved drugs, and dozens of natural
products. These sensors can be used to create ligand-regulated genetic circuits, drive
ligand-mediated reconstitution of split enzymes, and rapidly create sensitive diagnostic tests.
 While our platform is powerful, improvements in hit rate, throughput, and the chemical
space it can access are needed to empower high-efficiency sensor development; to achieve
this, we will combine strain engineering, high-throughput screening, and computational design.
Our improved pipeline will be used for 1-step isolation of >1000 moderate-affinity sensors of
FDA-approved drugs and other medically-relevant small molecules. 100 of these will be
evolved to high-affinity (nM) sensors by subsequent rounds of directed evolution. In parallel,
we will develop methods for converting these sensors into multiplexable diagnostics. The
technology developed will deliver new tools and methods for developing sensors of
user-specified molecules and open the door to user-specified chemical-regulated processes,
will have broad biomedical relevance and will advance biomedical research and clinical and
environmental diagnostics."
10908615,"The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the role of microglia, the resident immune cells of the retina and the
brain, in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide,
whose hallmark is progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In our prior work we have found that
microglia in glaucoma upregulate a disease-associated molecular signature that is shared with brain
neurodegenerations, and that genetic or pharmacologic targeting of molecules in this signaling pathway can
prevent RGC loss in a mouse model of glaucoma. Furthermore, we have found that microglia activated by
engulfment of apoptotic neurons can subsequently cause more RGC loss in the absence of high intraocular
pressure (IOP), demonstrating that microglia can propagate neuronal damage in glaucoma. Using the RNAseq
datasets from these studies, we have now identified the transmembrane receptor CD300lf as a key mediator of
microglial inflammatory response in glaucoma. CD300lf is a phosphatidylserine receptor with dual activating and
inhibitory capacity that can bind to damaged and apoptotic cells and, in the brain, is expressed only by myeloid
cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that 1) CD300lf is upregulated in retinal microglia from two mouse
glaucoma models; 2) CD300lf–/– animals are protected from RGC loss in the microbead glaucoma model despite
elevated IOP; and 3) unlike wildtype microglia, CD300lf–/– microglia do not upregulate inflammatory cytokines,
including Il-1, in response to damaged/apoptotic neurons in vivo. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
CD300lf is a key regulator of the microglial inflammatory response that exacerbates RGC loss in glaucoma. We
will address this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims:
1. Determine if microglia are the key myeloid cell subpopulation that mediates CD300lf effect in
glaucoma. In this aim, we will use CD300lffl/fl conditional knockouts to identify whether CD300lf harms RGCs by
acting in microglia or other myeloid cell subpopulations (monocytes, border-associated macrophages).
2: Investigate the effect of targeting CD300lf and its binding partners on inflammasome signaling. We
will evaluate the inflammatory response and the inflammasome function in myeloid cells deficient in CD300lf or
its binding partners in cell culture and in vivo.
3: Investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting CD300lf in glaucoma. We will assess the efficacy of
CD300lf neutralizing antibody fragment in protecting RGCs in a mouse model of glaucoma and evaluate if
CD300LF is upregulated in human postmortem eyes with glaucoma.
The research outlined in this proposal will define the role of CD300lf signaling in microglia in glaucoma, with the
ultimate goal of developing novel neuroprotective treatments for this common blinding disease."

Sitka Tribe of Alaska Environmental Research Laboratory Facility Service Core
The Facility Service Core of the Knowledge Warding Against Toxin Levels Center is run by the Sitka Tribe of
Alaska Environmental Research Lab (STA-ERL). Chris Whitehead will be the Facility Service Core Director, as
he established the STA-ERL in 2015 to support the Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR)
consortium. SEATOR was formed in 2013 to unify 17 Alaska Tribes in Southeast Alaska and Kodiak in detecting
paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) events that pose a human health risk to subsistence and commercial shellfish
harvesters. Each Tribal partner collects weekly shellfish samples at key community harvest sites and samples
are sent to STA-ERL for toxin analysis. The STA-ERL FSC is the only facility in Alaska that provides consistent,
timely toxin analysis for subsistence harvesters using the receptor binding assay (RBA) and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). At the core of each project are data elements derived from samples sent in by
SEATOR partners and analyzed by STA-ERL FSC. Project 1 will be estimating RBA and HPLC-measured
specific congeners as a function of environmental conditions. Project 2 compares toxicity as measured by RBA
against observed levels of HPLC-measured congeners. Project 3 assesses shellfish consumption patterns and
will consider food-specific toxin distributions. Managing such data requires collaborative expertise in analytical
methods. All STA-ERL lab analysts have been trained by chemists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) and receive annual technical support from NOAA partners. The STA-ERL FSC will
support the Center by providing accurate and timely data for all Research Projects in the Center as well as the
Community Engagement Core. The STA-ERL FSC will also be available to process samples for other regional
and state-based projects."
10733891,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium spp. threaten coastal populations of humans
and wildlife in Alaska. Toxins produced by Alexandrium can accumulate in shellfish and other filter feeders and
at high concentrations cause paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). In response to community concerns regarding
the safety of shellfish harvest Southeast Alaska Tribal Ocean Research (SEATOR), a network of coastal tribal
communities, created a robust and expansive monitoring program for HABs, shellfish toxins, and ocean
acidification (OA). A major concern for coastal Alaskan communities is how changing climate conditions will
affect the safety of subsistence shellfish harvest. Warming sea surface temperatures, air temperatures, and
increasing acidity have the potential to alter production of toxins by Alexandrium and increase the potential
bloom window into seasons not typically associated with HABs. This uncertainty will be addressed in this
project using a multi-faceted and rigorous approach. Aim 1 will leverage long term monitoring data from
SEATOR (n=3,433 shellfish samples), in situ environmental measurements, remote sensing products, and
traditional ecological knowledge to generate machine learning and mixed effects harmonic models predicting
shellfish toxins from environmental variables. These models will be used to predict future seasonal shellfish
toxin dynamics by incorporating regional downscaled climate projections. Congener specific data generated in
Project 2 will also be analyzed for species specific and spatial trends in association with environmental
variables. Aim 2 will analyze 919 discrete OA samples collected by coastal communities paired with 1,814
previously analyzed discrete samples to investigate spatiotemporal relationships between OA parameters (i.e.
pCO2) on shellfish toxin dynamics. Using OA parameters constrained from Aim 2 and future climate scenarios,
Aim 3 will use in vivo experimentation to examine the effects of changing ocean conditions (temperature,
pCO2) on toxin accumulation and maximum toxicity in subsistence shellfish species. This project creates an
important linkage between empirical models of HABs and shellfish toxicity and climate adaptation planning,
creating outputs of future HAB dynamics which are actionable and will be shared with tribal partners and
communities."
10880582,"Project Summary
Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is a major cause of distress and disability. The discovery of
the antidepressant effects of ketamine, an N
-Methyl-
D
-aspartate
glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist,
has brought new hope to TRD patients. The search for the biological bases underlying the antidepressant
effects of ketamine is a key priority. Preclinical studies suggest that, in the subcallosal cortex (SCC),
ketamine activates cortical circuits, increasing glutamate release, stimulating α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-
methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors (AMPAR), and engaging downstream
neuroplasticity mechanisms. In animal models of depression, AMPAR blockade prevents the
antidepressant effects of ketamine. However, it is unclear whether this applies to humans with TRD. With
the availability of the first FDA-approved AMPAR antagonist, perampanel, we can now test this
hypothesis. Aim 1 evaluates whether perampanel pretreatment prevents the reduction in depression
symptoms produced by ketamine in TRD patients. Aim 2 tests whether perampanel pretreatment
augments ketamine-related increases in SCC resting state functional connectivity. Aim 3 assesses whether
perampanel blocks ketamine-associated increases in SCC cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen relative to the
pre-ketamine baseline. These metabolic increases may subserve restoring synaptic connectivity in TRD
patients. Together these aims would provide an important test of a central hypothesis related to the
mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of ketamine and could inform efforts to develop alternatives
to ketamine as a treatment for TRD."
10874555,"Determination of chromatin protein dynamics in CD8 T cells
 CD8 T cells are crucial for antiviral and antitumor immunity. How these cells respond to stimulations and how
to manipulate their effector function for therapeutic purposes have been under intensively investigations. It is
widely accepted that T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and co-receptor signaling drives almost all the key processes
of CD8 T cell differentiation and function via transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Factors
modulating TCR signal transduction or target gene expression presumably play important roles in dictating CD8
T cell differentiation and immunological functions. Although proteins directly mediating TCR and co-receptor
signal transduction have been well defined, the nuclear proteins modulating target gene expression remain to
be fully investigated. Unbiased approaches are required to comprehensively reveal the nuclear proteins
regulating TCR and co-receptor dependent gene expression, potentially leading to the identification of novel
factors governing CD8 T cell differentiation and function that determine antiviral and antitumor immune response.
 Recently CRISPR screening offers an unprecedented efficiency to systematically delineate the regulators of
CD8 T cell differentiation and function. However, this method does not uncover the mechanistic linkage between
candidate factors and signaling pathways and is also severely constrained by available experimental readouts.
We reasoned that defining the dynamic proteins of the active gene promoters and enhancers in CD8 T cells
upon TCR and co-receptor stimulation would be a solution, because proteins recruited to or depleted at these
regions during this process would reveal novel key regulators. To determine the dynamic chromatin proteins at
genomic regions of interest, we recently developed a comparative proteomics method using antibody-guided
proximity biotinylation in a separate study. In preliminary experiments, we applied this method to mouse primary
CD8 T cells and profiled the dynamic proteins at active enhancers and promoters marked by histone H3 lysine
27 acetylation (H3K27ac) upon TCR and co-stimulation, because this signaling appears to act on these genetic
elements to control important functional genes in CD8 T cells (such as cytokines and Myc) by coordinating with
the histone acetylation pathway. This experiment revealed known TCR signal transducers and a number of novel
factors overrepresented or underrepresented. We then performed an in vivo pooled CRISPR screening by
knocking out these dynamic proteins and discovered several positive and negative regulators of tumor infiltrating
CD8 T cells. On the basis of these results, we propose to further define the chromatin protein dynamics in CD8
T cells and determine their roles in modulating inducible gene expression and CD8 T cell antitumor activity.
 Overall, we will employ a new proteomics method, developed by us, to determine signal dependent chromatin
protein dynamics to unbiasedly identify novel regulators of CD8 T cell function. These factors may serve as new
targets to improve CD8 T cell based immunotherapies."
10917343,"Currently most treatments for retinal diseases are based on frequent intravitreal injections, which are invasive, and could
lead to serious complications such as endophthalmitis and retinal detachment. The frequent injections are necessary because
the drugs delivered through the injection are cleared from the vitreous by multiple pathways. The frequency of injections
in real-world experience may be lower than recommended resulting in poorer-than-expected treatment outcomes. It is ideal
to administer ophthalmic drugs topically as eye drops but due to low bioavailability, they are not suitable to achieve
therapeutic benefits in the back of the eye. Contact lenses have been extensively investigated for delivering drugs to treat
anterior segment diseases because about 50% of the drug in the lenses permeates into the cornea compared to about 1-5%
with eye drops. Delivery of drugs to the back of the eye including sustained delivery by contact lenses has received
considerably less attention. Here we propose to advance contact lenses for back of the eye delivery, by determining the
underlying mechanisms of delivery, evaluating enhanced and sustained delivery with the lenses relative to eye drops,
developing models predictive of contact lens-based drug delivery, and developing novel lenses for delivery of biologics.
We have preliminary data showing feasibility of contact lens mediated delivery of drugs to the back of the eye. The proposal
will investigate two major pathways that can contribute to the back of the eye delivery from a contact lens: a) diffusion
across cornea into anterior chamber followed by uveoscleral outflow into sclera-choroid and b) non-corneal transport
involving diffusion into the tears followed by transverse diffusion across sclera and choroid into retina and vitreous. This
proposal combines in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo and in silico studies to determine the relative importance of these pathways.
We use a pharmacology-based approach in Aim 1 to evaluate the uveoscleral outflow pathway and a lens engineering-based
approach entailing piggyback lenses in Aim 2 to understand the non-corneal pathway and to deliver drugs via one of the
two pathways. Further, in Aim 2, we will develop and validate a novel, mechanistic, in-silico model incorporating drug and
tissue properties. The model will allow design of contact lenses for delivering drugs to the back of the eye at therapeutic
concentrations. In Aim 3, we will develop novel porous annulus lenses to deliver anti VEGF antibodies that are commonly
used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration. All in vivo and ex vivo experiments will be conducted in New
Zealand white rabbits that are commonly used for measuring ocular pharmacokinetics. In Aims 1 and 3, dexamethasone,
which is used for treating diabetic macular edema is investigated, and in Aim 2, a series of corticosteroids with Log(P)
ranging from 0.53 to 3.2 are used to explore the effect of hydrophobicity. In each of the Aims we use a novel approach of
integrating vitamin E nanobarriers into contact lenses (NB-CL) to control the drug release kinetics. The approach will
provide new fundamental insights into sustained drug delivery to the back of the eye using contact lenses. If successful,
NB-CL for sustained drug delivery will become a noninvasive approach for back of the eye drug delivery to replace invasive
intravitreal injections."
10931441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Suboptimal sleep, characterized by phenotypes such as insomnia, short sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea, is
associated with reduced cognitive performance and increased cognitive decline and dementia risk. There is
strong evidence of sleep disparities between race/ethnic and gender minorities, potentially relating to
downstream disparities in cognitive aging. However, the mechanisms by which sleep phenotypes accelerate
cognitive aging are not well understood. Identifying specific biological pathways and biomarkers of sleep
phenotypes will enable unconfounded quantification of the effect of sleep phenotypes on cognitive aging, risk
stratification, and development of potential intervention targets.
We will establish a collaboration across three longitudinal cohort studies representing the diverse U.S.
population: the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARIC) study, the Hispanic Community Health
Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL), and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), to study how
suboptimal sleep accelerates cognitive aging. We will study the associations of sleep disorders (insomnia,
short and long sleep, and obstructive sleep apnea) with harmonized, global measures of cognitive aging. We
will develop polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for sleep phenotypes using novel methodology, that will appropriately
account for heterogeneous genetic ancestry of study individuals, and identify sleep phenotypes that are
genetically strongly associated with cognitive aging based on PRSs. We will use omics (metabolomics and
proteomics) to explain biological pathways underlying the sleep-cognitive aging associations. We expect that
we will identify biomarkers and mediators of the sleep-related effects on cognitive aging, and using Mendelian
Randomization analyses, we will be able to untangle some of the directional associations. Finally, we will study
risk prediction models for cognitive aging that use sleep-related measures. We will study whether the identified
associations and risk prediction models generalize to AD-specific phenotypes in datasets of two cohorts from
the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center.
This work will result in the identification of omics biomarkers that measure and mediate the genetic risk of
sleep phenotypes on cognitive aging, and new risk models for cognitive aging based on PRSs and omics.
Importantly, our study will include individuals from diverse U.S. populations, and our methodology will ensure
that the findings and models are useful across populations. This work will guide precision medicine initiatives to
improve cognitive health in aging individuals from diverse genetic backgrounds."
10932197,"Abstract
There is strong evidence that prostate cancer (PCa) is a heritable phenotype. In addition to greater risk observed
in men with a family history of PCa, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 400 common
independent risk variants, which explain ~40% of the familial risk. It is increasingly recognized that much of the
unknown heritability for PCa may also be due to variants of low minor allele frequency (<1%). While large, multi-
ancestry genome-wide reference panels (e.g., TOPMed) have been developed to facilitate studies of less
common alleles (down to 0.1%), they cannot be used to enumerate and accurately study very rare alleles that
can only be characterized via sequencing. Pathogenic variants in DNA repair pathway genes (e.g., BRCA2,
ATM, NBN, CHEK2, PALB2), identified through candidate gene studies, provide strong support for exceedingly
rare (<0.1%) protein coding variation contributing to overall PCa and aggressive disease susceptibility.
Unfortunately, we remain limited in our ability to comprehensively survey and study very rare variation genome-
or exome-wide due to high sequencing costs, limiting current sample sizes. Here, we propose to combine existing
whole-exome (WES) and whole-genome (WGS) sequence data from multi-ancestry biobanks and cohorts to
conduct the first, large-scale study of rare coding variation in PCa and to integrate tumor somatic and germline
mutation data to elucidate the biology of gene-risk associations. In Aim 1, we will leverage existing WES data for
>90,000 PCa cases (58,000 European ancestry, 20,000 African ancestry, 4,000 Asian ancestry and 6,700
Latino/Hispanic) and >500,000 controls within biobanks and cohorts in the US and UK and conduct exome-wide
analyses of overall PCa and aggressive disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will examine the combined effect of
rare coding variants and a polygenic risk score (PRS) on risk of overall PCa and aggressive disease and estimate
absolute risks for the combined effects of rare coding variants and PRS in prospective biobanks and cohorts
across populations. In Aim 3, we will integrate somatic tumor and germline variation data to inform genes and
biological pathways involved in PCa and aggressive disease. For this Aim, we have assembled a somatic
resource of >7,000 PCa patients with germline exome/PRS data and somatic mutation profiling from WES and
WGS studies, including >2,000 with transcriptomic data. We expect this study to provide the most comprehensive
and well-powered examination of rare coding variation in PCa across populations to date. Findings from this
study will have immediate clinical translation by informing personalized risk prediction and the development of
novel risk-based screening strategies for overall and aggressive PCa. Integrating germline and somatic data will
also define biological mechanisms that may be clinically important for understanding how to treat and prevent
PCa and lethal disease across populations."
10897061,"Project Summary: In the U.S., there are more than 735,000 myocardial infarctions (MI) each year. While
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly reduced acute adverse repones, the long-term
prognosis for post-ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) patients remains poor. Due to the limited regenerative capacity of
human hearts, human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have received significant
attention due to their proven capacity to restore contractile function upon transplantation to injured hearts in
various mammalian models, leading to multiple ongoing clinical trials. However, the current transplantation
approach mainly relies on dissociated hPSC-CMs, leading to low cell survival, moderate functional improvement,
arrhythmogenic risk, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, our lab developed nanowired, pre-
vascularized human cardiac organoids composed of hPSC-CMs, human primary cardiac fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, stromal cells, and electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs). Endothelial cells are
used to induce vasculature formation within the organoids, and e-SiNWs are added to create an electrically
conductive microenvironment to facilitate hPSC-CM contractile development and their electrical integration with
the host myocardium. Our preliminary in vivo data showed that nanowired organoids illustrated robust hPSC-
CM engraftment and superior functional recovery. The major barriers in their clinical translation include: 1) the
use of animal proteins in the cell and organoid culture and 2) the lack of functional benefit demonstration in a
large animal model. Replacing human primary cells with isogenic hPSC-derived cells for organoid fabrication
would reduce batch-to-batch variations and enhance immune compatibility through Major Histocompatibility
Complex (MHC) matching hPSC donors with human recipients. In addition, while the current hPSC-CM
implantation strategy has been focused on intramyocardial injection, developing an effective approach for
intracoronary delivery of the organoids will accelerate their clinical translation. The goal of this proposal is to
develop clinical-grade hPSC cardiac organoids and demonstrate their functional benefits with a large animal
model to generate enabling data for IND submission. The central hypothesis of this proposal is the nanowired
isogenic hPSC cardiac organoids provide a scalable system to both efficiently and effectively implant hPSC-CMs
for cardiac repair. The proposal is innovative in that we will 1) derive isogenic hPSC-derived cells in xeno-free,
chemically defined conditions to develop clinical-grade cardiac organoids for implantation and 2) leverage the
size and the endothelial lumen-like structures in the organoids to develop an effective intracoronary delivery
strategy. Accordingly, we will pursue the following 2 aims: 1) Fabricate and characterize nanowired human
cardiac organoids using isogenic cardiac cells derived from hPSCs in xeno-free, chemically defined conditions,
and 2) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of the nanowired isogenic hPSC cardiac organoids with a porcine I/R
(ischemia/reperfusion) model."
10933453,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of the proposed research is to develop a transfer learning framework to
refine existing DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks and provide uncertainty quantification
along with age prediction. A growing body of evidence has shown that the DNAm levels
at specific age-related CpG sites represent stable and reproducible biomarkers of age.
While numerous epigenetic clocks have been constructed to predict chronological age,
age acceleration, or age-related diseases, they may lack generality or adaptability as
they are mostly developed and validated from a certain subpopulation. There exists little
research that explores how to transfer knowledge learned from the existing epigenetic
clocks trained with adults when new data are collected from a different subpopulation
such as the children and adolescent cohorts. This project will develop an innovative
transfer learning approach to update existing epigenetic clocks without re-accessing
individual-level data in the original training data. In addition, most existing epigenetic
clocks provide only point predictions without uncertainty quantification. However,
reasonable accuracy on a fixed validation set is not enough, and this project will also
extend the conformal inference framework to construct prediction intervals with a
guaranteed confidence level. Such a predictive paradigm with uncertainty quantification
is important because it communicates better with the science community by providing a
set of plausible predicted outcomes that covers the ground truth with a certain
probability. Furthermore, this proposed work will allow for an integration of sequential
updating and adaptive calibration procedures that construct prediction intervals with the
availability of rich new DNAm datasets collected from diverse populations. The
completion of this proposal will greatly improve the generalizability, reliability, and
adaptability of existing epigenetic clocks to a new target population such as the children
and adolescent cohort."
10924067,"SUMMARY
To date nine hallmarks of the aging process have been described, which can be grouped into three major
categories: primary hallmarks or cause of damage (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations
and loss of proteostasis), antagonist hallmarks or responses to damage (cellular senescence, mitochondrial
dysfunction and deregulated nutrient sensing) and integrative hallmarks or manifestations of the aging phenotype
(stem cell exhaustion and altered intercellular communication). Despite intensive research on each individual
hallmark, little is known about their interconnectivity and the hierarchies governing those interactions. A limiting
factor in these studies is the time and resources needed for developing, breeding and aging mouse models that
would allow to untangle the interactions as well as the lack of highly selective small molecules that would enable
somatic approaches. In this regard, our recent work showed for the first time the feasibility of employing cellular
therapy to eliminate cells that have entered a specific cellular program such as cellular senescence. In a proof-
of-concept study we identified uPAR as a surface molecule upregulated in cellular senescence and developed
CAR T cells able to eliminate senescent cells with high potency and specificity. CAR T cells have the advantage
that they can be administered somatically and are highly effective at exclusively targeting cells expressing a
specific antigen. In addition, they offer the possibility of spatial and temporal control making them highly versatile
tools. Herein we leverage our team’s expertise in senescence biology and cell engineering technology to shed
light into the interactions among the hallmarks of aging. Our goals are to characterize in depth the impact of
senolytic CAR T cells on the antagonistic and integrative hallmarks of aging; develop tissue specific senolytic
CAR T cells that would allow us to untangle hierarchies among the hallmarks across physiological lifespan and
study the therapeutic potential of modulating the interactions for the treatment of age-related pathologies.
Preliminary data strongly supports the feasibility of the proposed work: we have successfully and safely
employed senolytic CAR T cells in naturally aged mice and showed their high potency at eliminating target
positive cells in the tissues over long periods of time. Importantly, treatment with senolytic CAR T cells results in
significant improvements in healthspan. In our application, we continue to characterize in a systematic way the
effects across hallmarks and harness the flexibility of cellular therapy to untangle the hierarchies governing the
interactions. Overall, we expect our studies will lead to versatile tools to interrogate aging biology as well as to
the development of new therapies for a range of age-related pathologies."

10878944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Annually, about 50,000,000 doses of synthetic gadolinium imaging contrast agents are injected into
patients worldwide when getting an MRI. While these agents are extremely safe, they have the potential for
adverse effects in some patients. Also, they may accumulate in brain and bone tissues when a procedure is
repeated, with yet unknown risks. Currently, all MRI agents require some kind of chemical labeling, i.e. with
para- or ferro-magnetic metals or, recently, with hyperpolarized magnetic isotopes. The overall goal of this
BRG is the development of simple D-glucose as an MRI contrast agent. Advantages of using such a natural
agent are safety, absence of interference with contrast on standard anatomical images, low cost, and the
ability to perform repeated studies over a short period of time. We will first develop this technology for brain
cancer, after which it can be adjusted for general use. Contrast agents are used to visualize tumor anatomy
and physiology, which can provide information on malignancy and the response to treatment. Our hypothesis is
that D-glucose as an infusible MRI contrast agent can provide information on three important aspects of tumor
physiology, namely delivery, uptake (including effects of blood brain barrier disruption), and metabolism. If our
developments are successful, translation to clinical application will be fast since D-glucose is already widely
used for other indications (e.g. glucose tolerance test for diabetes), and its safety profile is well established.
 Our preliminary data show MRI detectability of D-glucose at millimolar concentrations in animal models at
11.7T and in brain tumor patients at 7T and 3T. However, there are technical issues at 3T due to the reduced
effect size, requiring additional technology development for motion correction, data acquisition, and analysis.
Our overall development goal for this BRG is to optimize and standardize the use of D-glucose as an infusible
contrast agent for diagnostic and prognostic imaging of tumor physiology at the clinical field strength of 3T. The
specific aims are (1) Design and optimize fast whole-brain dynamic MRI saturation pulse sequence technology
to detect D-glucose based (a) T2 relaxation effects, (b) combined chemical exchange saturation transfer
(CEST) and T2 relaxation effects; (2) Design and optimize CEST-MRI-compatible motion correction methods
for dynamic scanning including navigator echo guidance and deep learning analysis; (3) Design and optimize
semi-quantitative and quantitative data analysis approaches for visualizing tumor enhancement and obtaining
indicators of tumor D-glucose delivery, uptake, and metabolism; (4) Standardize the methods of aims 1-3 and
demonstrate repeatability and reproducibility to conclude the work with a clinical MRI protocol for dynamic
glucose-enhanced (DGE) MRI. To accomplish these aims with optimal efficiency, proper validation and clinical
relevance, we have established a multidisciplinary team of experts in the fields of MRI physics (pulse sequence
development), clinical oncology, biostatistics, and endocrinology, which will employ the facilities of several
Resource Centers available at Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
   
The overall goal of this research is to determine the mechanisms of symptom maintenance and   
exacerbation in Gulf War Veterans (GVs) suffering with Gulf War illness (GWI). To date, the pathophysiology of GWI is poorly understood, and there are currently no confirmed efficacious treatments for these Veterans. Research involving GVs and civilians with similar chronic multi-symptom illnesses (CMI) such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia show that multiple physiological systems are dysfunctional - principally the central, autonomic, and immune systems. Moreover, dysfunction within these systems is magnified and symptoms are exacerbated following an exercise challenge (i.e., post-exertion malaise [PEM]), providing a controllable model for the study of GWI.   
Our central hypothesis is that dysfunction across multiple physiological systems interacts to   
produce and maintain the symptoms of GWI, and this dysfunction is best studied via a PEM model. Our   
pilot data demonstrate that compared with healthy controls, patients with CMI (including GVs) demonstrate: (1) enhanced ratings and brain responses to painful stimuli and poor cerebral vascular auto-regulation, (2) augmented ratings and neural responses to fatiguing cognitive tasks, and (3) enhanced symptoms, increased pain sensitivity, and up-regulated gene expression to exercise challenge. These systems have been primarily studied in isolation and need to be studied under the same circumstances and within the same Veterans to determine the pathophysiological significance of their interactions. The primary goals of this project will b accomplished by comparing GVs with GWI to healthy GVs. The specific aims of the project are to determine: (1) baseline function across multiple physiological systems (CNS, autonomic, immune) in GVs with and without GWI; (2) the impact of an exercise challenge on CNS regulation of pain/fatigue, cardiovascular autonomic function, and immune system activity and symptoms in GVs with and without GWI; and (3) whether interactions among multiple systems significantly explain symptoms of GWI. CNS regulation of pain/fatigue will be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Autonomic regulation will be measured via cerebral blood flow and parasympathetic responses to postural challenge. Immune activity will be measured via gene expression of inflammatory mediators (i.e., pro-inflammatory cytokine, metabolic and glucocorticoid receptors). The exercise challenge will consist of a single bout of cycling on a standard cycle ergometer at 70% of predicted peak heart rate for 30 minutes. CNS regulation of paint/fatigue, autonomic regulation, and immune activity will be measured 24 hours post-exercise when Veterans are experiencing PEM. Symptoms will be measured with validated instruments to assess pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. Symptoms will be followed for one week after exercise challenge to characterize the presence, magnitude, and time-course of PEM in GWI. We expect that GVs with GWI will demonstrate dysfunction across multiple physiological systems, that these systems will become more impaired as a result of an exercise challenge, and that interactions among these   
systems will significantly explain symptoms at baseline and during symptom exacerbation (i.e., PEM).   
The goals of this project will significantly enhance our understanding of GWI and will begin to determine   
the physiological systems that are most impaired. Study findings will provide the first critical steps   
towards designing treatments for GWI that are mechanistically based on physiology rather than   
standard approaches designed to target symptoms. These goals are consistent with a recent Institute of Medicine evidence-based review (IOM, 2014) of treatment options for Veterans of Gulf, Iraq,and Afghanistan citing the need for individualized treatments that are specific to the Veteran. This treatment approach cannot be realized without first determining the pathophysiology of GWI - the primary goal of the proposed research."
10732758,"Knowing the structure, dynamics and ligand binding specificity of proteins and nucleic acids is essential to
understanding the mechanisms of human disease and to the optimal design of molecules that can intervene
therapeutically in disease processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy is one of the most
versatile techniques for obtaining this molecular information. This tremendous value of NMR in biomedical
science is only realized through the application of powerful computational tools. Our goal in this project is to
continue the development of, and add powerful new features to, an integrated software application for the
computational analysis of NMR data. Having this effective software, NMRFx, for NMR is especially critical as
we realize that deep insight into macromolecular structure and function comes not from a single technique like
NMR, but from the complementary information from various techniques including NMR, X-ray crystallography,
and Cryo-electron microscopy. Scientists are no longer seeing these techniques as specialized techniques
usable by only domain experts, but as a collection of techniques that can and should be applied together.
Without this NMRFx software, researchers must otherwise use a variety of tools from different labs that have
different programming languages, scripting tools, naming conventions, graphical interfaces, documentation
styles etc. The NMRFx software that is the subject of this project integrates signal processing, data analysis,
visualization and macromolecular structure calculations based on NMR data. In the current project this
software will be enhanced with the addition of an integrated deep learning library that will allow new types of
data analyses using these new tools that are making major advances in scientific research. The performance
of the software will be dramatically enhanced by the addition of a software library that allows computations to
be dispatched to high-performance hardware like GPUs (graphical processing units) and FPGAs (Field
Programmable Gate Arrays). This performance enhancement will allow much faster computations and allow
use of algorithms that were previously too slow to use in interactive analyses. We will also complete the
implementation of the remaining features necessary for the full analysis of NMR data. We propose that by
providing new and experienced users with an enhanced version of our software application that has a common
installation protocol, interface style, data structures, and overall design, we can substantially lower barriers to
the use of NMR. NMRFx is making the use of NMR techniques more accessible to a wider population of
researchers. The software, including the addition of the deep learning and acceleration libraries, will increase
the contributions of NMR in a broad range of biological research areas that impact on human health."

This is an application for a two-year planning grant to build capacity for an international advanced research
training in schistosomiasis in Uganda. The high burden of schistosomiasis in Uganda persists since the
1950’s Over 50% of the Ugandan population is at risk of exposure to Schistosoma species and its
complications of fatal upper gastro-intestinal bleeding among adults. Gaps in control of schistosomiasis
remain due to limited number of scientists with capacity to conduct advanced research and training focused
on schistosomiasis epidemiology, vector biology, immunology, vaccinology, therapeutics, genomics,
computational biology to model the schistosomiasis transmission, data science and artificial intelligence to
model population behavior and other predictors of disease severity, as well as local development and
production of effective vaccine candidates, and the application of locally generated data to inform relevant
interventions for disease surveillance and control interventions in the affected communities. We propose to
conduct a comprehensive needs assessment of the existing research and training capacity for
schistosomiasis at Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) and the collaborating
institutions in Uganda (Uganda Virus Research Institute-UVRI, the Ministry of Vector Control Division in
charge of schistosomiasis and other medical schools in the country). Findings from the needs assessment
will be used to develop of an innovative research training and career enhancement program to strengthen
capacity of scientists and health research professionals to conduct independent, multi-disciplinary research
in schistosomiasis. During the two-year planning period we will hold multiple stakeholder engagements and
identify the research training resources, local and international faculty, scientific environment contributions
and administrative processes needed to undertake a schistosomiasis research training program. We will
establish a strong executive committee to oversee the design and preparation of advanced scientific didactic
and methodology courses (physical and virtual) and research training resources for schistosomiasis
epidemiology, disease management, prevention, and control. We will also establish an international multi-
disciplinary training advisory committee that will meet quarterly to guide and monitor the progress of the
planning process against the set goals and milestones. The proposed planning grant will build on existing
infection and immunity research training partnerships between MakCHS and UVRI, and long-standing
research training collaborations with our US partners (John Hopkins University and University of Washington).
We will reach out for new collaborations that may be required locally and abroad to establish a wholistic,
multi-disciplinary network of scientists with an effective organizational structure that will support the
envisioned research training program, and resultant collaborative five-year training program (D43) application
for better control schistosomiasis in Uganda.

10908650,"Pendrin (SLC26A4) is expressed in epithelial tissues, e.g., in the inner ear, thyroid, kidney, and lung where it
plays a central role in ion homeostasis and the regulation of the cell volume. Mutations in the Slc26a4 gene
cause Pendred Syndrome and enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS), both of which are genetic
disorders characterized by childhood early hearing loss in children and account for 5-10% of hereditary hearing
loss and are currently not curable. Previous studies illuminated the role of pendrin in the physiology of the
cochlea, thyroid gland, kidney and proposed that it can transport iodide ions (I-), bicarbonate ions (HCO3-),
chloride ions (Cl-), and hydroxide ions (OH-) across epithelial cell membranes according to an electroneutral
exchange (antiport) reaction. However, our understanding of pendrin remains rudimentary due to a lack of
purified protein that enables precise functional studies without the potential interference of native proteins replete
in cellular/native systems and structural studies. To overcome this gap in our understanding, we have
successfully expressed and purified a mammalian homolog of human pendrin and developed binding and
transport assays to determine substrate selectivity and transport. Preliminary studies confirmed that purified
pendrin reconstituted in lipid membranes transports I- or HCO3- in exchange with Cl- or OH- and revealed that
the transport process is electrogenic, i.e., the stoichiometry of ion exchange is not 1:1 as previously postulated
for electroneutral antiport. We determined I-- and HCO3--bound pendrin structures by cryo-electron microscopy,
and our preliminary analysis suggests that pendrin has two anion binding sites, which may provide an explanation
for the electrogenic transport process. The structure reveals novel interactions between the transmembrane
domain (TMD) and the cytosolic domain, i.e., the sulphate transporter and anti-sigma factor antagonist domain
(STAS) that appears to be relevant for the transport mechanism because mutations at the interface of STAS and
TMD are known to cause Pendred Syndrome. Pendrin is also a promising drug target for attenuating airway
hyperresponsiveness in asthma and for reducing hypertension, and many pendrin inhibitors, e.g., the non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drug niflumic acid, has been reported to target pendrin, but the mechanisms of
inhibition remain unknown. Whereas these inhibitors could be repurposed to target pendrin, their action on
pendrin may also cause undesired side-effects, thus highlighting the need to elucidate the mechanisms of
pendrin inhibition by small molecules. We determined the structures of pendrin in complex with the anti-
inflammatory drugs YS-01 and niflumic acid, and our preliminary analysis shows that the two inhibitors occupy
different binding sites, providing motivation for the further determination of the mechanisms of inhibition. To this
end, the overall goal of this project is to understand the mechanism and pharmacology of pendrin at the atomic
level to aid in the development of efficacious drugs that specifically target pendrin in improved therapies against
Pendred Syndrome and EVAS."

Neurons communicate with each other by the quantal release of neurotransmitters stored in synaptic vesicles
(SVs), and the strength and efficacy of neurotransmitter release are dynamically altered during physiological
activity. This process is essential for learning and memory and is disrupted in many neurological disorders. The
neurotransmitter release occurs from a pool of SVs docked at the presynaptic active zone and is tightly controlled
by activity-dependent changes in the presynaptic calcium ions concentration ([Ca2+]). At nerve terminals, Ca2+-
sensing proteins (Synaptotagmins) couple vesicular release machinery (SNAREs) to Ca2+ signals, thus
orchestrating neuronal communication. Despite years of research, there remains a substantial gap between a
qualitative description of how the vesicle fusion machinery operates and the millisecond-precision and Ca2+-
dependent kinetics of neurotransmitter release observed at the neuronal synapses.
In this proposal, we describe the first systematic and comprehensive effort to reconcile the `molecular
biochemistry' of vesicle fusion with the `physiology' of Ca2+-evoked neurotransmitter release in the neuronal
synapses using a combination of complementary in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. Specifically, we aim
to resolve whether Synaptotagmin isoforms with distinct biochemical properties (Syt1 and Syt7), along with the
synaptic SNAREs represent the minimal protein machinery for different modes of neurotransmitter release and
short-term plasticity. We also propose to quantitatively test the hypothesis that the `dual-binding' of Syt1 and
Syt7 to SNAREs allows for synergistic regulation of vesicular release kinetics. For in vitro analysis, we will deploy
a biochemically-defined, high-throughput fusion system capable of tracking individual vesicle docking and Ca2+
triggered fusion on a millisecond timescale, which is integrated with fast Ca2+-uncaging protocols to generate
[Ca2+] transients mimicking presynaptic calcium dynamics. This will be complemented by physiological analysis
in cultured neurons utilizing fast, fluorescent glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) and Ca2+ dyes to image quantal
glutamate release and presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics in individual presynaptic boutons with 2-4 millisecond temporal
resolution. We anticipate that this project will provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms
underlying neurotransmitter release and build toward a detailed mechanistic model of Ca2+-evoked synaptic
vesicle fusion. Overall, this will greatly enhance our understanding of neurotransmission and of how it is tuned
across different nerve cells allowing specific yet diverse communication in neuronal networks."

Physical activity (PA) is one of the most promising approaches for mitigating age-related cognitive decline and
risk for dementia, yet few sufficiently powered randomized clinical trials (RCT) targeting brain health outcomes
have been conducted. Further, little is known about the biological pathways and moderators of the brain
response to exercise. To address these gaps, we have conducted a multi-site, supervised, dose-response
(150min/wk of moderate-intensity; 225min/wk of moderate-intensity; 150min/wk of light intensity), aerobic
exercise RCT with brain health outcomes as the primary endpoints in 648 cognitively normal adults between
65-80 years of age. This study, Investigating Gains in Neurocognition in an Intervention Trial of Exercise
(IGNITE), was funded by the NIH in 2016. The RCT has been enormously successful in terms of exceeding
sample size expectations, maintaining high adherence and compliance (>80%), minimal missing data,
improving cardiorespiratory fitness, and achieving the expected distribution of under-represented minorities
(25% non-white). The results from IGNITE are bound to be transformative, but there will remain many
unanswered questions after the conclusion of IGNITE that we intend to address in this proposal. For example,
does a 12-month aerobic exercise RCT have any persistent or protracted benefits to cognitive, neural, or
neuropathological outcomes 5-years after the completion of the intervention? Was the RCT effective at
modifying long-term exercise behaviors? Can we utilize the rich participant data of IGNITE to forecast who is
more likely to maintain a physically active lifestyle after the completion of the intervention? How effective was
the exercise RCT for modifying the accumulation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology over a 5-year
follow-up? And, finally, if cognitive, brain, or markers of neuropathology are different as a function of group
assignment 5-years after the completion of the intervention, which factors mediate those long-term benefits?
The answers to these questions will have significant scientific and public health implications that we will
address in a cost-effective manner by conducting a 5-year follow-up evaluation of IGNITE participants. We
focus on 4 key aims and one discovery science aim: Aim 1: Test the effects of the IGNITE exercise RCT on
cognitive performance 5-years after the completion of the intervention. Aim 2: Examine the extent to which
participants maintained exercise behaviors 5-years after the completion of the intervention. Aim 3: Test
whether the intervention modified 5-year accumulation of AD neuropathology. Aim 4: Test whether the
exercise RCT influenced 5-year follow-up of neuroimaging markers of brain health. Discovery Science Aim:
Explore whether participant characteristics at baseline predict long-term engagement in exercise behaviors
after the completion of the intervention."

Capillary leak is common in acutely critically ill children. Although no gold standard definition exists, it is clinically
recognized as new or worsening organ failure despite appropriate cardiovascular resuscitation. Unfortunately,
little has been learned of the pathophysiologic processes despite decades of struggling at the bedside of volume
overloaded children with multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Treatment is limited to intensive supportive care
for failing organ systems. Less confusion exists in vitro, where leak around cultured human microvascular
endothelial cells (EC) is identified as disruption of intercellular tight junctions (TJs) with functional changes in
monolayer permselectivity. Such changes may be modeled in the EC response to cytokines, including those
known to be elevated in the plasma of critically ill children. However, targeting specific cytokines has repeatedly
failed to improve patient outcomes. Our overarching hypothesis is that while a great many leak-producing
cytokines may be elevated in acute critical illness, there are only limited EC responses and that final
common signaling pathways result in leak either between (para-) or through (trans-) ECs are therapeutic
targets. However, the relative contributions of trans- and paracellular leak to the clinical manifestations of leak
(i.e., organ dysfunction) and the pathways that cause them are incompletely understood. We will focus on targets
we identified upregulated in ECs isolated from critically ill children (collected from vascular access insertion
equipment and immediately analyzed by single-cell RNA-sequencing). This unique data set has identified
candidate regulatory molecules associated with paracellular leak and oncostatin M (OSM) as a novel mediator
of transcellular leak. We will test the contribution of these targets to leak in our culture models of TJ-forming
human microvascular ECs from a healthy donor (both male and female) skin and lung using trans-endothelial
electrical resistance, macromolecular flux assays, morphological analyses, molecular engineering, and immuno-
chemical tools. Aim 1 will utilize tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to model paracellular leak to test the hypotheses
that ArhGEF15, ArhGAP21, and -26 regulate RhoB activity, promoting junctional disassembly via downstream
kinases directly acting on TJs and amplified new gene transcription. We have also discovered that formoterol,
but not other β2-adrenergic agonists, inhibits TNF-induced leak and will investigate potential mechanisms. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that OSM induces vesicle-associated JAK3/STAT3 signaling resulting in transcellular
leak, which also depends on new gene expression, and investigate how formoterol reduces OSM-induced leak.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine if the specific pathways identified in Aims 1 and 2 are recapitulated in intact
human capillaries in vivo using human skin xenografts in mice and ex vivo using machine-perfused human lungs.
The proposed research will advance our fundamental understanding of how capillary leak occurs in acutely
critically ill children and evaluate an FDA-approved therapy re-targeted to the endothelium to prevent or reverse
capillary leak, greatly improving the care of our sickest patients."

Angiogenesis is recognized as a biomarker of cancer malignancy. Ultrasonic (US) imaging, super-resolution
ultrasound, micro Doppler and acoustic angiography enable the imaging of vessel networks, but the information
provided by these images is not quantitative.
We propose real-time quantitative assessment of angiogenesis based on Ultrasound Multiple Scattering (USMS)
analysis from raw ultrasound data. The proposed USMS parameters will enable the development of biomarkers
of cancer aggressiveness. We will validate our methods for cancer applications, but this novel biomedical
imaging technology will find applications beyond cancer (to atherosclerosis for example).
For breast cancer diagnosis, X-Ray mammography can be ineffective in some populations and MRI present
some challenges of cost, accessibility, and some contra-indications related to the use of Gadolinium contrast.
Conventional US is highly sensitive but lacks specificity. A more specific US tool would improve our ability to
discriminate indeterminate non-lethal disease from lethal cancers, and make a clinical impact on a notable
percentage of the at-risk population.
Studies assessing the prognostic value of tumor angiogenesis have found a positive association between
increasing microvessel densities and worsening prognosis. There is a relationship between multiple scattering
parameters and vascular density when vessels are populated by contrast agents. We hypothesize that
measuring USMS parameters will enable assessing vascular density and therefore increase the specificity of
ultrasound for cancer diagnosis.
To verify this hypothesis, we propose to develop, optimize and validate novel ultrasound methods utilizing
multiple scattering approaches. These methods will enable the quantitative characterization of the micro-
architecture of angiogenesis, leading to improvements in ultrasound specificity.
In this project, we will: i) Develop and optimize a quantitative ultrasound method to assess microvascular density
and anisotropy non-invasively. ii) Establish the proof of concept that multiple scattering can be used to
characterize angiogenesis and assess tumor malignancy in two rodent studies. ii) Validate our new technology
in a preliminary study on human patients, and compare the diagnostic power of the developed methods to the
currently available standard point of care ultrasound.
This research will dramatically increase the specificity of US imaging of angiogenesis, and enable Contrast-
Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) to become a reliable and widely used clinical tool for the diagnosis of cancer, or
the evaluation of likelihood of plaque rupture. Ultimately, the methods developed will be used for diagnosis and
monitoring of cancer, and could find other applications such as the prediction of plaque rupture in atherosclerosis."

This proposal “Next generation T cell therapies for KRAS mutated solid tumors” was developed in response to
RFA-CA-22-028 and to fulfill the Cancer Adoptive Cellular Therapy Network (Can-ACT) objectives. The focus of
our proposal is targeting mutant KRAS, a clonal driver oncoprotein, by the early-stage clinical testing of
TCR1020, a T cell receptor specific for mKRAS G12V restricted to HLA-A*11:01. If successful, this novel-state-
of-the-art Adoptive Cell Therapy (ACT) could be available to ~5,000 new solid tumor patients per year in the US.
Advances in gene editing together with new insights related to mechanisms of T cell exhaustion provide the
scientific basis for development of the next generation T cell therapies in solid tumors. Our central hypothesis
is that targeting mutant KRAS through the action of TCR1020-T cells, engineered to overcome cell intrinsic
mechanisms of exhaustion and counteract a cell extrinsic myeloid checkpoint to overcome TME resistance, will
promote durable tumor regression in solid tumors. There are three hypothesis-driven specific Aims in this
proposal. In Aim 1, we will develop genetically modified T cells expressing TCR1020 targeting mKRAS
G12V/HLA-A*11:01 to overcome extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of resistance. In Aim 2, we plan to evaluate
TCR1020-T CD4+ cells to improve the persistence and potency of mKRAS specific CD8+ effector cells. In Aim
3, the safety and clinical activity of engineered TCR1020-T cell products will be determined in a dose escalation
multi-site phase 1 study. We have assembled an exceptional group of investigators with an extensive track
record of collaboration and productivity with expertise in human immunology, immuno-oncology, cell therapy, T
cell engineering and gene editing. Additionally, experts in molecular pathology and biomarker discovery will
contribute to cutting-edge correlative studies to aid in biomarker development and TME characterization to
delineate potential mechanisms of response and resistance. The Center for Cellular Immunotherapies (CCI) at
the University of Pennsylvania has extensive expertise in the development of ACT therapies producing more
than 2,500 cell products for administration to adult and pediatric patients. CCI has a long track record of
technology transfer related to cell therapies to both large pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, Kymriah) and
biotechnology companies over the past decade. As a multi-site trial application, an important programmatic
component of our proposal is to leverage NCI resources thru utilization of the Immune Cell Network (ICN) Core
at FNLCR to manufacture, test, release and distribute the engineered TCR1020-T cell products. In summary,
our proposal incorporates multiple scientific and technological innovations that targets a recurrent clonal driver
oncoprotein with engineered T cells modified to resist T cell exhaustion and overcome the immunosuppressive
TME."
10896205,"Accelerating Treatment Development for Psychosis in AD: MODEL AD+P
 Psychotic symptoms occur in ~ 40-60% of individuals with Alzheimer Disease (AD with psychosis,
AD+P). Numerous studies have found that the AD+P phenotype is associated with more rapid cognitive
decline than AD subjects without psychosis (AD-P). Current, empirically developed treatments for psychosis in
AD have limited efficacy, do not alter the more rapid disease progression, and are associated with substantial
toxicity, including excess mortality. The goal of this renewal is to close several critical gaps in knowledge that
currently inhibit effective treatment development for psychosis in AD: delineation of the neurobiologic signature
distinguishing AD+P from AD-P; identification of drugs that reverse this signature, and; development of
construct and face valid models of AD+P in which to evaluate these drugs.
 We look to achieve this goal by building on a series of accomplishments from the current funding period,
in which we: 1) Identified a genome-wide significant locus for AD+P risk in SUMF1 and found reduced SUMF1
mRNA expression in excitatory neurons in AD+P; 2) Confirmed associations of AD+P with excess phosphotau
burden and newly demonstrated that AD+P is associated with excess loss of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
glutamatergic neurons relative to AD-P; 3) Showed that AD+P (relative to AD-P) is further characterized by
reduced postsynaptic density (PSD) yield and profound loss of PSD proteins exceeding the loss of glutamate
neurons; 4) Characterized the PSD protein signature of AD+P relative to AD-P, finding reduced levels of a
network of protein kinases and regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and; 5) Generated computational
predictions of drugs that may reverse the PSD protein signature of AD+P.
 We will now conduct a set of integrated experiments that will: Aim 1) more finely resolve signaling
alterations in AD+P by characterizing the PSD phosphoproteome and kinome signature of AD+P; Aim 2) test
computationally identified drugs for effects on the PSD protein and phosophoprotein signature in mouse
models of AD pathology, and; Aim 3) reduce SUMF1 expression in mouse models of AD pathology to evaluate
if this manipulation recapitulates the neurobiology of psychosis in AD and could thus serve as a construct and
face valid model to evaluate for predictive validity in future pharmacological studies.
 If successful, we will have more finely characterized the PSD biology of AD+P, validated several
available drugs as potential novel treatment candidates, and established the first construct and face valid
model of AD+P for drug testing. We will also share with the larger research community extensive data on the
PSD proteome and phosphoproteome of: AD+/-P, normal elderly, multiple mouse models of AD, and drug
treatments. These outcomes will help accelerate development of experimental therapeutics for AD+P."

genetically engineered mice that Tgfbr2 is required for development and maintenance of the fibrous tissues in
the spine including the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc, ligaments, and tendon. Previous results
obtained in my laboratory indicate that Tgfb regulates cell fate decisions in the sclerotome, the embryonic
progenitor of the connective tissues in the spine. In this application, we propose to address the instructive
mechanisms whereby Tgfb regulates embryonic formation of fibrous tissues in the spine. In addition, we
propose to address the problem of sclerotome resegmentation, an embryonic process that creates the spatial
organization of tissues in the spine. Alterations in resegmentation would be expected to alter the context in
which cells differentiate, affecting permissive signals and competence to respond to instructive signals that
govern cell fate decisions. Finally, using a mouse model developed in my laboratory, we will start to determine
the mechanisms of how Tgfb acts to maintain fibrous character in the postnatal annulus fibrosus. The overall
aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine the signaling pathways used by Tgfb to generate fibrous tissues of
the spine during embryonic development; 2) To map the process of resegmentation and determine the
mechanism of Tgfb-mediated regulation and 3) To understand how Tgfb maintains annulus fibrosus
postnatally. The experiments described here will provide mechanistic information about development and
maintenance of the axial skeleton and provide a foundation for future regeneration and engineering strategies
in the spine."

Screening is an established method for decreasing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. However,
despite guidance supporting CRC screening initiation (i.e., 45 years), relatively little is known about what to do
after a precancerous polyp is detected and removed. This is particularly concerning given that over 40% of
individuals who undergo CRC screening are found to have a precancerous polyp and then instructed to
undergo frequent colonoscopies (termed surveillance) every 3-10 years for CRC risk reduction. Current
guidelines utilize a risk-stratification scheme that categorizes patients as high or low risk based only on polyp
characteristics from their initial colonoscopy. However, polyp-based risk stratification methods are imprecise,
with a sensitivity and specificity of 59-81% and 43-58%, respectively, for predicting subsequent advanced
neoplasia after polyp removal. Thus, our current guideline-based risk stratification methods both miss high-risk
individuals who may benefit from early surveillance and subject many low-risk individuals to unnecessary
colonoscopies and its associated harms. Recent studies from our group and others have identified several
clinical and genetic (i.e., polygenic risk score) risk factors associated with CRC; these may further optimize risk
stratification following CRC screening and polyp removal, but remain understudied. For this R01 proposal, we
will first develop and validate a practical, clinically useful risk prediction tool that incorporates both detailed
polyp characteristics and other important predictors known to play an important role in CRC risk, such as
clinical and genetic (i.e., polygenic risk score) risk factors (Aims 1 and 2). Second, we will identify optimal
strategies for CRC surveillance given individual risk estimates defined in Aims 1-2 and evaluate the cost-
effectiveness of different risk-stratified surveillance strategies compared to current guideline recommended
polyp-based surveillance strategies (Aim 3). This Aim will leverage our ongoing collaboration with an
established, internationally recognized micro-simulation model (MISCAN-Colon) that informs U.S. Preventative
Task Force recommendations. Lastly, we will gain patient, clinician, and service provider’s perspectives on
these novel comprehensive risk prediction methods, to optimize potential adoption, and assess potential
implementation barriers and facilitators (Aim 4). This aim will incorporate group experiences with mixed
methods techniques to identify attitudes and barriers of implementation. The overall aims will leverage
comprehensive data from an extremely large contemporary community-based cohort and an independent
cohort for validation. These cohorts’ detailed data include genome-wide genotype arrays coupled with prior
screening, pathologic and clinical data, and surveillance outcomes. This study can substantially transform how
we manage care for over 7 million patients diagnosed annually with precancerous polyps, personalize post-
polypectomy surveillance using a new, novel, comprehensive, patient-centered risk prediction model, and
optimize post-polypectomy surveillance to reduce CRC incidence and mortality."
10912803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This R01 proposal tests the central hypothesis that gonadal hormones present during a critical window of
perinatal brain organization result in distinct sex-specific microglial and mitochondrial phenotypes that increase
male vulnerability to perinatal immune stimuli. There is a strong male bias in the incidence of many early-onset
neurodevelopmental disorders. Although neurodevelopmental disorders are quite heterogeneous, growing
evidence demonstrates immune and mitochondrial abnormalities in a subset of these patients. Microglia, the
innate immune cells of the brain, have emerged as key effectors of this neuroimmune communication. We find
that microglia isolated from mice exposed to an early-life immune challenge show significant downregulation of
genes encoding mitochondrial electron transport genes, specifically in males. Additionally, we find that this
early-life immune challenge results in male-biased social behavior deficits, and specifically induces dysfunction
in other aspects of male microglial mitochondrial functionality. To determine what could be mediating these
early-onset sex differences, we first used the knowledge that there is a surge of gonadal hormones that occurs
only in males during a perinatal critical period of brain development. Injecting female mouse pups during this
perinatal critical period with estradiol, the aromatized form of the androgen testosterone that directly
masculinizes the male brain, results in a male-typical phenotype. We have found that masculinized females
subjected to early-life immune challenge display similar deficits in social behavior as did immune-challenged
males, with similar microglial mitochondrial alterations as were observed in immune-challenged males. We
have also demonstrated that estrogen receptors known to influence mitochondrial function are differentially
expressed on microglia between males and females. Using this knowledge, we can alter estrogen receptor
signaling in a cell-specific manner to study the importance of microglial estrogen receptors to male-biased
neurodevelopmental disorder vulnerabilities.
 In this proposal, we will assess whether microglia-specific alterations in mitochondrial morphology, gene
expression, and bioenergetic function are dependent upon microglia-specific estrogen or androgen receptor
signaling, as well as assess whether early-life immune challenge impacts social behavior through aberrant
microglial phagocytosis of synapses, as well as the impact of the perinatal gonadal hormone surge and
microglial estrogen/androgen receptors on these processes. This proposal will be the first to examine a
mechanistic relationship between perinatal gonadal hormone exposure through microglial estrogen and
androgen receptors and the establishment of sex-biased neurodevelopment that induce male-biased
vulnerabilities to neurodevelopmental disorders."
10918253,"ABSTRACT
Several studies demonstrated that daily alcohol consumption (~1g) increases breast cancer risk by ~20% in
women by promoting estrogen and other hormones, DNA damage as well as cell proliferation and epithelial–
mesenchymal transition. Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase 2 (ErbB2) is a transmembrane receptor with intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity that plays an important role in human malignancies providing an enhanced response to
ethanol-stimulated cell growth, invasion and migration. Normally, 20 ~ 30% of breast cancer with poor prognosis
and relapse are ErbB2-positive. Alcohol appears to control signaling parameters of both upstream and
downstream ErbB2 targets. Despite the efficacy of ErbB2-targeting therapy for breast cancer, only a fraction of
patients responds successfully to therapy, while risks of recurrence are still high. The StAR related lipid transfer
protein 10 (StarD10) is a phospho protein lipid transporter that shuttle the molecules from the endoplasmic
reticulum through the plasma membrane and regulates its integrity, well-known to be altered during cell cancer
transformation. StarD10 was described to be co-expressed with ErbB2 in 35% of primary human breast cancers,
thereby supporting its role in deregulated cell growth and tumorigenesis. We recently reported that ethanol
administration enhances StarD10 expression via ErbB2-induced p65 in MMTV-neu transgenic mice and in breast
cancer cell lines. Also, StarD10 overexpression increases membrane fluidity, while ethanol promotes its
dephosphorylation at tyrosine 288 residue (T288) points towards a lipid-related phenomenon. This proposal tests
the novel hypothesis that ethanol induces changes in StarD10 biological activity, which may play a key role in
breast cellular homeostasis thereby regulating malignancy/aggressiveness defining a novel therapeutic target.
Aim 1: Examine how phosphorylation of StarD10 influences its biological function upon alcohol
exposure in breast cancer. We will define the role of StarD10 phosphorylation (pStarD10) in ethanol-induced
in breast cancer using CRISPR–Cas9 technology for the precise genome editing of pStarD10 at threonine 288
residue impacting on its lipid transporter activity, thus on plasma membrane fluidity. Aim 2: Examine the role
of ethanol-induced StarD10 activity in ErbB2 signaling. We will investigate whether the phospho status of
StarD10 influences ErbB2 activity and downstream pathways by its role as lipid transporter. Also, ErbB2 nuclear
translocation will be examine. Aim 3: Examine the effects of StarD10 L260 gene editing in ethanol-fed breast
cancer model. We will investigate whether protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activates StarD10 by
dephosphorylating T288 residue inhibits aggressiveness in vitro ethanol-treated human breast cancer organoids
(hBr-OUs) and in vivo hBr-OUs transplanted mouse model when the PP2A is mutated by CRISPR technology.
Successful completion of these aims should enhance our knowledge of the complex interplay between the
StarD10 phosphorylation and ErbB2 cell signaling ethanol-induced breast cancer, topics that are highly relevant
to public health."
10893575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Negative feedback control is essential to make biological systems stable to internal and external perturbations,
just as homes need thermostats to maintain a fixed room temperature. In cells feedback is used to regulate
everything from gene expression to chromosome replication, and its failure causes a range of disorders. But our
understanding of feedback in biology is very incomplete. Most theoretical approaches use mathematical
frameworks that are poorly suited to describe cells because they ignore a main source of perturbations: chemical
reactions involve molecules in low numbers and since each individual reaction is probabilistic, fluctuations in
concentrations arise spontaneously. Unlike man-made machines, where the control systems (e.g. thermostats)
are fundamentally different from the processes they control (temperature fluctuations), the chemical control
systems in cells are similar to the chemical processes they control. This makes it difficult for cells to suppress
perturbations, and also makes it difficult for researchers to analyze control. Experimentally, very few systems
allow both accurate measurements of concentrations in single cells and systematic modifications of the control
system to analyze how they affect the system. Individual analyses can also focus so closely on the specific
details of one specific system that general guiding principles are overlooked or misinterpreted.
We propose to address these problems by developing new mathematical approaches and systematically
applying our novel experimental assays to central model system: bacterial plasmids. Our preliminary theory
demonstrates hard limits on the ability of negative feedback to suppress fluctuations in cells. It also suggests
creative and counter-intuitive mechanisms that minimize these problems. Remarkably, we have found examples
of these in plasmids that we know are under strong selection to suppress noise. We have also developed three
types of experimental platforms to quantitatively address fluctuations and control in cells in general and for
plasmids in particular: Accurate and independently validated single-molecule counting assays, high-throughput
cell tracking platforms allowing us to follow a billion cell divisions with microscopy, and assays for highly accurate
genotype-to-phenotype mapping for a million parallel lineages and control mutants.
In addition to the importance of fundamentally understanding fluctuations and feedback control, bacterial
plasmids are also very relevant medically, since they cause the majority of multidrug resistance cases in
hospitals, a problem that leads to millions of serious illnesses and tens of thousands of deaths annually in the
US alone. They are also key tools in biotechnology, where the fluctuation suppression properties we study are
a significant nuisance. The unmatched experimental tractability of plasmids allows us to systematically vary
control properties and rigorously test the mathematical descriptions experimentally, leading to a deeper
understanding of feedback mechanisms and also an increase in useful knowledge about plasmid behavior."
10840887,"The β-herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects around 50% of the world population. Although it remains asymptomatic in healthy individuals, it is never completely cleared from the host and can cause recurrent infections, especially at times of immunosuppression. HCMV poses the biggest threat to pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals, whose symptoms tend to be more severe. The mouse homolog of HCMV, murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), is a well-characterized animal model of viral infection. Like HCMV, MCMV has a tropism for the salivary glands (SMG) and persists in this organ for several months after primary infection. We have demonstrated that NK cells, which are critical in the spleen and blood, are hyporesponsive in the SMG, conceivably explaining the MCMV persistence in this organ. Interestingly, our preliminary data show that salivary gland NK cells regain normal effector functions against MCMV when relocated to different tissues, indicating that the salivary gland environment regulates NK cell function. MCMV exploits the SMG as the key site of viral persistence, which, similar to tumors, creates an immune environment with mechanisms to preclude excessive inflammation and/or tissue damage. Because the immune response to cancer and infection exhibit commonalities, we reasoned that the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology is likely to be regulated in part by checkpoint inhibitors within the salivary glands, especially during the persistence phase. Our data demonstrate that targeting KLRG1 improves the effector immune response to MCMV and survival at certain doses, but can lead to immunopathology depending on the dose. Our data also suggest that NK cells may inhibit CD8+ T cell recruitment, proliferation and effector functions in the salivary glands via the PD-1 pathway. This is supported by CITE-seq/TotalSeq on sorted T cells, showing expansion of unique CD8+ T cell clusters. Based on this preliminary data, we hypothesize that NK cells contribute to CMV control while preventing immunopathology by limiting the expansion of CD8+ T cells in the salivary glands. The overall goal of this proposal is to reveal the underlying mechanisms leading to MCMV persistence. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate how the equilibrium between pathogen clearance and immunopathology is regulated. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate how MCMV persistence is regulated in the salivary glands. In Specific Aim 3, we will investigate how NK cells inhibit T cell accumulation possibly limiting immunopathology in the salivary glands. We have generated a large number of tools to investigate the questions asked in this proposal. We are now in an excellent position to conduct the proposed studies. The results from these studies are likely to have relevance to infections caused by other viruses and aid in the design of strategies and therapeutics directed at manipulating effector cells during viral infection."
10877844,"Delineating a parietal-anterior cingulate-claustrum circuit underlying cognitive control and attention
Treatments are urgently needed for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric patients. Given the link between such
dysfunction and outcome in patients, large numbers of clinical trials were conducted with companies attempting
to be ‘first-to-market’. In the rush however, preclinical studies used had limited validity to the cognitive domains
reportedly targeted. Thus, circuit-engagement of the cognitive domain tested was rarely if-at-all verified and all
clinical trials to-date have failed. New paradigms have emerged with reported relevance to domains affected in
psychiatry, but little opportunity to validate circuits underlying these behaviors, let-alone drugs that modulate
such circuits and behavior, have arisen. This application will utilize a circuit-targeted approach to confirm the
utility of the 5-choice continuous performance test (5C-CPT) to measure cognitive control and attention across
multiple psychiatric disorders. Specific Aim 1 will optimize the touchscreen 5C-CPT for parametric
manipulation. The 5C-CPT exists for mice, rats, and humans, with EEG & fMRI versions. The task has always
been standard however, primarily in 5-hole operant chambers, but a touchscreen version with parametric
manipulations within the task would improve translatability to human testing and enable task performance-based
consistency. Backward masking of stimuli have been used in cognitive control tasks previously, but only recently
used in human 5C-CPT studies. Here, we will demonstrate that such masked trials enable parametric
assessment of 5C-CPT performance in mice. Specific Aim 2 will determine the pharmacological sensitivity
of the touchscreen 5C-CPT. After developing the task, it is important to confirm that it is sensitive to
manipulations, including those available for use in humans for pharmacological predictive validation. We
demonstrated that modafinil improves healthy human participant performance of the standard 5C-CPT, while
scopolamine impairs mouse performance. Here, we will confirm that modafinil and scopolamine similarly affect
this masked touchscreen 5C-CPT, while predicting that a dopamine D4 receptor agonist would improve cognitive
control. We will confirm that modafinil rescues scopolamine-induced deficits, avoiding receptor tautological
complications. Specific Aim 3 will confirm the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)claustrum and
claustrumparietal cortex (PC) circuit underlying this masked touchscreen 5C-CPT performance.
Consistent with human CPTs, we confirmed the necessity of the PC for mouse 5-choice (5C-)CPT performance.
We hypothesize that a ACC to claustrum projection is important during more cognitively demanding trials (from
parametric manipulations), while a claustrum to PC projection occurs is important for selecting whether to
respond or not during trials. Using fiber photometry and optogenetic techniques, we will confirm both the
activation and necessity of this circuit respectively, including changes in activity as a direct result of
pharmacological manipulation. Thus, circuitry underlying cognitive control will be identified, as will
pharmacological treatments affecting this circuit that are readily testable in healthy human participants."
10914936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This career development proposal is designed to provide Fred Ketchum, MD, PhD, with the necessary
training to become an independent clinician-scientist developing interventions to improve decision-
making and communication about preclinical biomarker testing that are inclusive to the needs of diverse
patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Dr. Ketchum will build upon his
existing skills in qualitative research and medical communication to acquire additional skills in 1) user-
centered design and implementation based on healthcare systems engineering approaches; 2) design
and conduct of clinical trials of behavioral interventions with racially and ethnically diverse populations;
3) training in decision sciences. As an early-career researcher at an institution with an extensive
infrastructure to support early-stage investigators and committed expert mentors, Dr. Ketchum is in an
ideal environment to complete the proposed research and training.
This proposal seeks to develop and pilot test an intervention to support decision-making about blood
biomarker testing in primary care settings. Rapid advances towards blood biomarkers to screen for
preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease are a major step towards addressing the devastating consequences of
this condition by reducing diagnostic delays, broadening access for diverse populations, and ultimately
allowing disease modifying therapies to be started sooner. Blood biomarker testing is expected to be
used heavily by Primary Care Providers (PCPs), who make initial decisions about screening, diagnosis,
and referral for patients with cognitive complaints. However, decisions about testing are complex, and
there is a crucial need to support decisions among PCPs and their patients to address the gap between
the future availability of biomarkers and integration into routine diagnostic decisions by PCPs, thereby
advancing NIA’s strategic priority of developing effective interventions to address the burden of age-
related diseases like ADRD. Aim 1 seeks to characterize decision-making processes related to clinical
evaluations for cognitive complaints and identify decision-support needs among patients and PCPs.
Aim 2 will adapt a decision-support tool for blood biomarker testing for use in diagnostic evaluations of
cognitive complaints by PCPs in diverse populations through a user-centered design process. Aim 3
will test usability and acceptability of the intervention, and effects on shared decision-making. These
data will support submission of an R01 proposal at the end of this award to determine the effects of the
decision support tool on shared decision-making about blood biomarker testing in preclinical
Alzheimer’s Disease in a large national sample."
11182852,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rapid, inexpensive detection of biomarkers at the point of care is vital for many clinical purposes. However,
limitations in current detection platforms have prevented the sensitive detection of many protein and small
molecule biomarkers, forcing clinicians to rely on either potentially inaccurate empirical diagnosis or expensive
lab tests to make critical treatment decisions. Sensitive detection of nucleic acid targets has been readily
achieved by exploiting Watson-Crick base pairing to amplify signals (e.g., PCR), but there has been a lack of
innovation for detection of low concentration antigens and small molecules at the point of care. Nature, on the
other hand, has evolved intricate mechanisms for rapidly amplifying protein signals in vivo via post-translational
modification and protein-based signaling networks that could be adapted for biomarker detection. Towards the
goal of developing novel, rapid, ultrasensitive diagnostics, the central hypothesis of this project is that
in vitro, protein-based signaling networks incorporating self-amplifying motifs can detect clinical
biomarkers. Specifically, we plan to incorporate three mechanisms of protein signaling networks with potential
for diagnostics: split enzyme reconstitution, autocatalytic positive feedback loops, and small molecule
biosensors. We have previously demonstrated the in vitro use of split adenylate cyclase for small molecule
detection via the simultaneous binding of two proteins (i.e. a sandwich assay in solution), bringing two halves
of adenylate cyclase together and producing cAMP. Aim 1 (K99) will incorporate binding domains for
detection of clinically relevant biomarker targets and investigate detection in human sample matrices.
We will test different binding domains fused to split adenylate cyclase fragments to detect Hepatitis C Core
Antigen (HCVcAg). Towards the development of a point-of-care diagnostic, Aim 2 (K99) will optimize
reaction components for lyophilization and long-term storage and develop a hand-held point-of-care
reader to detect the shift in fluorescence produced by the FRET-based cAMP biosensor. Lab-bench
validation of all components will be performed using HCVcAg spiked into commercially purchased pooled
blood samples. Aim 3 (R00) will investigate the use of split adenylate cyclase and cAMP receptor protein
to create an autocatalytic feedback loop in vitro. This work would result in the first known in vitro protein
signaling network with bistable switch-like sensing, a significant advancement for the diagnostics field. If
successful, this system would be broadly applicable for protein and small molecule detection and could be
used to detect a wide range of target analytes with known binding domains. As such, future work includes the
incorporation of binding domains to detect other high value protein and small molecule analytes currently
unable to be rapidly detected at the point of care and the clinical translation of the described diagnostic device
with pilot clinical trials in collaboration with both domestic and foreign clinical partners."
10892284,"African American prostate cancer patients are known to be diagnosed at an earlier age, present with aggressive
disease, and are twice as likely to succumb to prostate cancer than other demographic groups. Despite a major
focus on socioeconomic factors, recent findings strongly argue for the existence of biological factors driving
cancer disparities. In my efforts to understand biological drivers in prostate cancer, I applied a novel DNA
damage detection method, Repair Assisted Damage Detection (RADD), and established that African American
tumors have more DNA lesions overall than EA tumors, especially uracil lesions. Our lab has previously
demonstrated that the homocysteine-methionine pathway is a metabolic hallmark of African American prostate
cancers, which fuels the progression of the folate cycle that is required for the conversion of deoxyuridine
monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). An upregulation of metabolites in the de
novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and altered levels of folate cycle metabolites were identified in African
American prostate tumors, suggesting the link between uracil metabolism and uracil lesion accumulation. Uracil
lesions are repaired by the base excision repair pathway. We have also shown that expression of XRCC1, a
protein involved in coordinating base excision repair function, was lower in African American prostate tumors,
indicative of defective base excision repair. These data collectively suggest that African American tumors exhibit
the consequences of thymidylate stress, where the ability of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) to convert dUMP to
dTMP is obstructed, resulting in dysregulation of base excision through the retention of uracil lesions. The
increased amounts of uracil lesions in African American men could be a cumulative result of changes in
nucleotide metabolism, which is caused by altered levels of components in the folate cycle and one-carbon
metabolism. These components, such Vitamin B12 and folate, are known to be reduced in African American
men, which could result from either dietary deficiencies or due to an aberrant homocysteine-methionine cycle,
or both. While we understand the molecular consequences of reduced folate as it relates to uracil accumulation,
the circumstances surrounding the DNA damage response through the regulation of Vitamin B12 and folate is
currently unknown. The hypothesis of this proposal is that altered levels of Vitamin B12 and folate contribute to
thymidylate stress, resulting in base excision repair pathway dysfunction and promoting prostate cancer
progression in African American men. In this proposal, we will 1) determine the clinical relevance of
homocysteine, Vitamin B12, and folate with prostate cancer progression in African American men and 2)
elucidate the role of homocysteine, Vitamin B12, and folate regulation on TYMS function and base excision
repair in African American prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of these aims will establish a link
between metabolism and DNA repair in African American men with prostate cancer and help develop metabolic
biomarkers to stratify these patients for DNA repair inhibitor therapies."
10892267,"Informatics Approaches to Understand and Reduce Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescribing by Dentists
 Project Summary
Although antibiotics (ABx) have saved many lives, their inappropriate use contributes to antimicrobial
resistance. Overprescribing ABx can also lead to allergic reactions and adverse events (AEs) such as
Clostridiodes difficile infection (CDI). Antibiotic stewardship reduces negative health effects of ABx use, thus
preserving its future utility and is supported by the American Dental Association (ADA). Antibiotic prophylaxis
prior to dental procedures should be reserved for patients at high risk of post-treatment complications. Despite
these recommendations, inappropriate ABx prescribing for prophylaxis before dental procedures is common,
with 70-80% of prophylactic ABx prescribed outside guidelines
 Our group has conducted relevant pivotal work and have found that dentistry lags in fostering the
uptake of research-informed treatments. We have found that initiatives to improve evidence-based dental
practice are often developed and implemented without a deep understanding of the problem, including reasons
why dentists deviate from established prescribing guidelines. Our long-term goal is to build a sustainable
national dental Learning Health System (LHS) focused on continuous quality improvement that facilitates
providing patients with high quality, affordable, evidence-based oral healthcare. To do this, we first need to
establish a practice-level LHS supported by an effective informatics infrastructure, relevant data governance
and a culture of learning that drives evidence-based dental practice.
 In this project, we seek to quantify and understand guideline discordant antibiotic prescribing, and to
iteratively develop improvement strategies to appropriately target prescribing to the right patients with the right
ABx at the right time. Through a deep understanding of why antibiotics are so frequently prescribed outside of
the guidelines, we expect to engage the dental team and patients to develop feasible interventions. We will
conduct the research at two large group practices: HealthPartners (HP) and Willamette Dental Group (WDG)
which together have over 900,000 patient visits per year. Our project team comprises of experts in dental
informatics, pharmacology, healthcare quality and safety, and human factors. In Aim 1, we develop and
validate an EHR-based algorithm/quality measure to determine concordance with current evidence-based
antibiotic prescribing guidelines. In Aim 2, we identify and understand factors associated with guideline
concordant/discordant prescribing of antibiotics through patient and provider interviews, and targeted clinic
observations. In Aim 3, using a participatory human-centered design process, we design improvement
strategies to increase concordance with evidence-based ABx guidelines. The outcomes of our research will
arm the dental field with both the knowledge and know-how to measure and reduce inappropriate ABx
prescribing by dentists resulting in better oral health, and subsequently better general health, for our patients."
10932391,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Training of health professionals in sexual health care is critical to address a broad array of a nation’s sexual
and reproductive health concerns. Research evaluating the effects of sexual health curricula on provider
behavior is rare. In sub-Saharan Africa, an environment with the world’s highest rates of HIV, STIs, and
multiple sexual and reproductive health challenges, training of health students in sexual health care is almost
non-existent. Consequently, a rigorous study of its effects is needed if such education is to be widely adopted.
In our “Training for Health Professionals” (THP-1) study, at Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences
(MUHAS) in Tanzania, we conducted formative research to identify the most common sexual health concerns.
We then tailored a sexual health curriculum training for healthcare providers to the African context and
conducted the world’s first single-blind, randomized controlled trial of its effects. Participants were 412 nursing,
midwifery, and medical students at MUHAS. Post-test evaluations with the intervention arm showed the
curriculum to be highly acceptable, culturally appropriate, needed, and feasible. At 3-month follow-up, as
compared to controls, intervention arm students had moderate-to-large increases in sexual health knowledge,
improved attitudes, and improved clinical skills. As required in a renewal application (THP-2), our long-term
objective remains “to improve the sexual health outcomes for individuals in Tanzania by building the sexual
and reproductive healthcare delivery skills of the health workforce.” We have three new specific aims. Aim 1
will assess the medium and long-term effectiveness of an African-centric, sexual health curriculum. We will
conduct a single-blinded RCT of the curriculum against a waitlist control arm, to assess the effects on sexual
health knowledge, attitudes, and counseling skills at 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up (n=155 students per arm;
310 in total). In Aim 2, we will develop a train-the-trainer curriculum. We will conduct a training needs
assessment of faculty at the ten other health universities in Tanzania, develop training materials, and pilot the
training to faculty at two other health universities: University of Dodoma (UDOM) and Kilimanjaro Christian
Medical College (KCMC). In Aim 3, we will conduct a Phase IV trial. This will be an observational study of the
curriculum being taught by their faculty at the two new sites with 3- 6- and 12-month follow-up. MUHAS,
KCMC, and UDOM are the largest health universities in Tanzania. This curriculum has high potential to be
widely adopted as a new standard of training across Tanzania. These results also have high potential to inform
the adaptation of sexual health curricula across Africa and beyond the continent, to other LMICs."
10880701,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) tumors are characterized by an abundant, tumor-
promoting immune infiltrate that is composed of immune suppressive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
These cells promote angiogenesis, suppress T cell recruitment and/or activation and promote metastasis in
mCRPC. T cells exclusion by TAMs in mCRPC leads to resistance of immune checkpoint therapy. Annually,
nearly 270,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) in the U.S. in 2021 and more than 33,000 men
will die from this disease. Therefore, mCRPC is an unmet medical need and there is an urgent need to develop
innovative therapeutics that would target immune suppressive TAMs that will enhance responses to therapies
and benefit mCRPC patients. We sought to re-establish an anti-tumor immune response by targeting surface
receptors on TAMs that help drive PCa progression. Using human PCa tumor microarrays, we published that
the macrophage mannose receptor (CD206) increased during PCa progression to mCRPC. Our team then
selectively targeted of CD206 using RP-182, a 10-mer amphipathic analog of host defense peptide that
selectively induces a conformational switch of CD206 expressed on TAMs. RP-182-mediated induction of CD206
in human and murine TAMs elicits a program of endocytosis, phagosomelysosome formation, cancer cell
phagocytosis, and reprograms immune-suppressive TAMs to an anti-tumor inflammatory phenotype. In
syngeneic and autochthonous murine cancer models, RP-182 suppressed tumor growth, extended survival, and
was an effective combination partner with chemo- or immune checkpoint therapy. In the proposed studies, we
will evaluate the premise that CD206+ TAMs play an essential role in PCa tumor progression and therapeutic
resistance. We hypothesize that the immune-suppressive CD206+ TAMs drive PCa resistance to
immunotherapies and therapeutic inhibition of CD206+ TAMs will re-educate TAMs to the pro-inflammatory
phenotype, enhance anti-tumor immune responses and will synergize with chemo- or immune checkpoint
therapy. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Establish the contribution of CD206+ TAM function in PCa
tumorigenesis and immune evasion; 2) Elucidate how inhibition of CD206+ TAMs may synergize wirh anti-PD-
L1 to enhance anti-tumor immunity 3) Correlate CD206+ TAM infiltrate with Nivolumab response, PCa bone
metastasis and patient outcomes. Utilizing a humanized mice and a novel syngeneic mCRPC mouse model in
which tumors are heavily infiltrated with CD206+ TAMs and refractory to immune checkpoint therapy, we will
characterize the changes in adaptive and immune responses after CD206 is inhibited both in vitro and in vivo.
In the third aim, we will measure CD206+ TAM expression in human PCa from mCRPC bone and single-cell
RNA sequenced PCa tumors from a Nivolumab clinical trial. Targeting CD206+ TAMs in syngeneic murine tumor
models and patient-derived xenotransplantation models in humanized mice has great potential to alter the tumor
microenvironment and enhance anti-tumor immune responses that may lead to novel therapeutics for mCRPC."
10909285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past 40 years, the prevalence of obesity has increased markedly in the US—doubling among adults
and disproportionately affecting racial/ethnic minorities. This has increased the clinical, social and economic
burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for the public, and especially so for minorities. CVD and its antecedent
risk factors (i.e., obesity, dyslipidemia, inflammation, elevated blood pressure) also display notable disparities
in risk. For example, obesity risk varies by socioeconomic status, SES, i.e. by educational attainment, income,
occupational status; yet, it is unclear exactly how socioeconomic adversity is translated into the biologic
changes that lead to greater disease burden. Epigenetics provides a framework for testing how adverse
environments and life experiences change biologic processes and shape disease risk. Our study will leverage
~9,000 ancestrally diverse individuals four large racially/ethnically diverse NIH-funded cohorts: Atherosclerosis
and Risk in Communities (ARIC), Women’s Health Initiative, Jackson Heart Study, and the Multi-Ethnic Cohort
Study with existing data to test if DNA methylation is a biologic mechanism through which SES leads to obesity
and downstream cardiometabolic dysfunction. Our preliminary analyses in ARIC African Americans identified
differential DNA methylation associated with components of socioeconomic adversity at several obesity-related
genes, lending strong and convincing support for our innovative hypotheses. Herein, we propose a
comprehensive analysis of extant methylation data from five race/ethnic groups using a composite score of
SES as well as multiple obesity measures. Our two specific aims will: 1) identify DNA methylation sites that
mediate the association between socioeconomic adversity and obesity, independent of local genetic variation;
and 2) integrate all available bio-social data to model the pathways between SES, obesity and ultimately CVD
outcomes. Funding from this grant mechanism will allow us to describe extent that DNA methylation sites are
associated with SES and/or obesity, and how these changes (or their interactions with SES) vary across
race/ethnic groups to contribute to CVD disparities. Our study is innovative due to its unprecedented
integration of survey, examination, and DNA methylation-typing on an ancestrally diverse sample. This
project’s anticipated findings will improve both our mechanistic understanding of obesity and CVD, and our
ability to identify potentially-actionable public health or pharmacologic interventions for CVD in diverse
populations."

Project 3 aims to evaluate community shellfish harvesting and consumption patterns and risk perceptions
around PSP to develop community-specific risk profiles. In our first aim, we use in-depth interviews of
community members involved in subsistence shellfish harvesting in five small Gulf of Alaska communities to
assess perceptions of local and regional health risks with respect to PSP. This highly localized data may serve
a critical need that is overlooked and excluded from current regulatory approaches to PSP health protection in
the region. In our second aim, we develop and deploy a mix-mode (mail and web) population survey to assess
the prevalence of lifetime PSP in selected Alaskan boroughs, along with demographic and cultural correlates of
behavioral and dietary intentions associated with PSP risk. Survey items will be informed by aim 1 formative
research as well as established instruments, and research themes identified by Tribal stakeholders as crucial
for understanding the cumulative risk that communities face from toxin exposures. In our third aim, we
develop and execute probabilistic health risk models based on shellfish and consumption distributions to better
inform communities as to the possible risk profiles in areas where subsistence harvesting and consumption is
common, especially outside of commercial sites. These models will incorporate community-specific parameters
informed by aims 1 and 2 to tailor assessments and risk evaluations, and models will include climate and water
quality parameters to facilitate the development of predictive, tailored risk evaluations."
10894929,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Persistent cell migration is fundamental for immune responses, development, and the dissemination of cancer
cells. This migration requires the establishment and maintenance of stable cell polarity, even while a cell
integrates noisy heterogeneous cues from its environment. To achieve this, Rho family GTPases act as central
hubs that organize signaling cascades and cytoskeletal rearrangements into subcellular domains. Feedback and
crosstalk connections are thought to be central to this pattern-forming ability. However, the wiring of this circuit
is still incompletely understood, and there are major gaps in our understanding of how negative regulators limit
and separate spatial domains. Determining these molecular connections in migrating leukocytes would identify
new therapeutic targets for treating inflammation and would be broadly relevant for understanding Rho GTPase
function in many cell types and biological processes. Major obstacles to progress have been the fast timescale
and inherently spatial nature of the signaling system. To address these challenges, we have developed new
molecular tools that allow us to control the activity of individual key components with light while measuring the
response of a second component with subcellular resolution in live single cells. Our preliminary results indicate
that in addition to acting as outputs to move the cell, different actin assemblies are intimately involved in the
biochemical wiring of Rho GTPase crosstalk. We have identified an “actin-gated” crosstalk connection between
RhoA and Cdc42, and we have identified the protein Arhgap30 as a previously unappreciated primary regulator
of Cdc42 that is critical for polarization and migration in leukocytes. We hypothesize that different actin
assemblies act as scaffolds to localize regulators of Rho GTPase crosstalk, creating subcellular zones with
distinct signal wiring to promote stable cell polarity. Specifically, we aim to 1) determine how branched actin
assembly regulates Cdc42 and RhoA activities in leukocyte cells, 2) determine how the local actin network
structure controls crosstalk between RhoA and Cdc42, and 3) determine the regulation and role of Arhgap30 in
crosstalk and polarity signaling. Our approach will combine new tool sets for optical control of signaling and
cytoskeletal components with simultaneous measurement of actin assemblies and Rho GTPase activities in
single cells. In combination, we will use chemical perturbations, mutational analysis, and biochemical
approaches to characterize molecular connections. Our long-term goals are to determine how reciprocal
regulation between actin and Rho GTPases creates robust polarity in multiple cell types, including leukocytes
and disseminating cancer cells. The proposed research will advance our basic understanding of how biochemical
signaling pathways both generate and stabilize subcellular domains to control behaviors such as cell migration."
10899606,"Limited knowledge of the structures and biological activities of products generated by free
radical-induced lipid oxidation in the retina is a barrier to progress in the development of clinically
useful new disease markers and mechanistically informed therapeutic interventions. Understand-
ing cellular responses to free radical-induced lipid oxidation products is complex owing to their
diversity and ability to mimic enzymatically generated receptor agonists. Their unrecognized
generation and biological activities almost certainly contribute to the mediocre efficacy of currently
available therapeutic measures for age related macular degeneration (AMD). We discovered
glutathione (GSH) derivatives produced from oxidatively truncated arachidonyl phospholipids that
are structural and functional analogues of cysteinyl (Cys) leukotrienes (LTs). We refer to them as
pseudo (ø)LTs. We will test the hypotheses that øLTs contribute to retinal pathology and
physiology in a rat model of light-induced retinal degeneration. Pilot studies show that øLTs are
present in human retina, are produced in vivo consequent to oxidative insult, and exhibit LT-like
biological activities. Therefore, øLTs can elicit cellular responses erroneously presumed to be
induced exclusively by CysLTs. Consequently, they are a confounding factor for interpreting
previous studies on the involvements of LTs in retinal pathology and physiology. The proposed
research will test the hypotheses that øLTs and related GSH derivatives of oxidatively truncated
docosahexaenoyl phospholipids contribute to receptor-dependent inflammatory cytokine signal-
ing, retinal edema, pathological neovascularization, or physiologically important initiation of retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE) autophagy. The potential pathophysiological significance of these
glutathionylated products of lipid oxidation lies in the possibility of their ubiquitous generation in
high levels, e.g., compared to those of CysLTs. We will test the conclusion of preliminary studies
that øLTs are LT receptor agonists and determine if their ability to induce the expression of IL-13
and TGF-b1 promotes LT biosynthesis. Because cross reactivity may confound the interpretation
of immunoassays, we quantitate øLTs and LTs by LC-MS/MS. We will determine signaling path-
ways, e.g., with RNA-Seq studies, activated by glutathionylated products of free radical-induced
lipid oxidation addressing the questions: do they promote inflammation in ocular pathology
or initiate autophagy in RPE cells and how do they do it? Molecular level insights into the role
of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of inflammatory eye diseases such as AMD can facilitate
development of therapeutic interventions that ameliorate the progression of these common but
disabling diseases."

The glenoid labrum is a fibrocartilaginous structure that lines the edge of the glenoid rim of the shoulder joint.
Glenoid labral tears, or lesions, can occur in several distinct locations (anterior, superior, or posterior) with
variable morphology (detachment from bone or intrasubstance) and have been associated with chronic shoulder
pain and/or instability. While operative intervention is typically needed to re-attach the damaged labrum to the
glenoid bone or to directly repair an intrasubstance tear of the labrum, recurrent shoulder instability and pain
following surgical repair of the labrum has been reported to be as high as 30%. This continued disability following
treatment is consistent with the poor healing capacity of the labrum. Current labral repair typically involves the
use of anchors and sutures to restore stability of the labrum and shoulder, but rarely promotes actual
regeneration of the injured labrum. Although cell therapy and tissue engineering approaches have been used to
improve cartilage and bone healing, these approaches have not been explored to improve glenoid labrum healing.
To address this deficiency in the treatment of glenoid labral injuries, it is essential to improve our knowledge of
the process of labral tear associated tissue injury and to develop a new treatment method assisting in labral
tissue regeneration and functional recovery. In our laboratory, substantial progress has been made on this front.
Briefly, click-chemistry based adhesives have been synthesized and these adhesives possess good tissue
attachment, cell/tissue compatibility, and in situ growth factor releasing property. Equally important, our studies
have uncovered an abundant source of progenitor cells in human and rat labrum tissue, which can be recruited
to the injured sites and stimulated to produce abundant extracellular matrix protein for accelerated labrum healing.
When evaluated in an in vivo glenoid labrum tear rat model, the application of bioadhesive alone suffices to
reduce 90% inflammatory cell infiltration and ~70% labral tissue erosion. By eliciting progenitor cell responses
(recruitment, proliferation, and ECM production), the application of growth factor-releasing adhesive scaffold was
found to enhance labral healing (with complete labral tear regeneration by 6 weeks vs. 50% labral
degeneration/lost in no treatment control). These exciting findings support two hypotheses. First, an adhesive
can be fabricated to serve as a scaffold matrix to bridge and seal the gap within the torn labrum, and preferentially
recruit and stimulate endogenous labral progenitor cells to the injury site for repairing and regenerating damaged
labral tissue. Second, labral tear injury mediated synovial inflammatory responses and infiltration of inflammatory
cells in and around the tear site cause labral tissue erosion. These hypotheses will be investigated through 3-
series of studies. The successful completion of the proposed work will significantly improve our understanding
of labral tear-associated tissue damage and lead to the creation of a new treatment approach for promoting
labrum regeneration complementing current surgical labral repair of torn labrum with suture anchor strategies."

The aging process is associated with an increased risk of failure of therapeutic strategies to treat hematopoietic
diseases, which often rely on myelosuppression and transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). There
is a substantial need for the development of preventative and therapeutic options to delay the aging process, to
rejuvenate tissues/organs, and to enhance regeneration and repair. However, the ability to truly rejuvenate aged
HSCs or their supportive niches has eluded scientists. To date, published rejuvenation studies have shown
marginal improvements in a few aspects of aged HSC function and have made exaggerated claims of `HSC
rejuvenation' without employing assays to stringently evaluate aged stem cells. This research proposal reveals
Netrin-1 (NTN1) as a niche-derived signal that can be utilized as a therapeutic that can restore the function of
an aged HSC, including its self-renewal capabilities, by reactivating DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathways
and resolving DNA damage, a hallmark feature of the aging hematopoietic system. We further define NTN1 as
a critical regulator of HSC niche function, where deletion of NTN1 in critical bone marrow (BM) niche constituents
leads to a decrease in vascular integrity and mesenchymal stem cell function. This proposal will elucidate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which aging of the BM niche contributes to the decline of HSC function,
as well as validate Netrin-1 as a new therapeutic target whose infusion can enhance, preserve, and rejuvenate
an aging hematopoietic system. Specifically, we will: 1) determine which HSC-specific and BM niche-specific
NTN1 receptors are critical for rejuvenating the aged hematopoietic system, 2) determine if NTN1 treatment can
prevent or temporize the aging process to promote hematopoietic health span and longevity, 3) discover the
cellular interactions and molecular mechanisms regulated by NTN1 signaling that are responsible for activating
DDR pathways within HSCs and BM niche cells, and 4) test whether in vivo infusion of NTN1 can enhance the
regeneration of an aged BM microenvironment following myelosuppression. Our research plan will utilize
innovative in vivo animal models and imaging techniques to determine if we can alleviate aging-related
pathological hematopoietic phenotypes observed in aged individuals by enhancing NTN1 signaling. Using
sophisticated animal models, we will determine the critical cellular sources of NTN1 and its receptors in a cell-
specific manner that are required to preserve HSC and niche function during the aging process. The success of
this research proposal will open up new avenues for the development of a wide array of therapeutic strategies
designed to effectively reverse age-related hematopoietic deficiencies."
10892870,"SUMMARY
Transcriptional networks in cancer are a collection of inputs from developmental and cell identity programs,
oncogenic proteins, metabolic circuits, and micro-environmental interactions. Together, these culminate to drive
disparate stages of tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression. Ependymoma (EPN) is an aggressive form
of pediatric brain cancer driven by a single genetic event, a gene fusion between ZFTA and RELA. ZFTA-RELA
(denoted ZRFUS) is a potent driver of transformation, and its expression is sufficient to induce EPN when
expressed in the developing mouse brain. Despite evidence that ZRFUS functions as an aberrant transcriptional
regulator, the downstream mechanisms it utilizes to drive tumorigenesis remain poorly defined. This knowledge
gap has hindered the identification of clinically tractable approaches for EPN, which have remained stagnant for
over 30 years. Therefore the overarching goal of this proposal is to dissect how ZRFUS impacts and
intersects with the diverse transcriptional programs that drive EPN tumorigenesis. To dissect how ZRFUS
drives EPN tumorigenesis, we established the first autochthonous mouse model of ZRFUS EPN using in utero
electroporation (IUE) of the developing mouse brain. Using this model, we demonstrated that transcription factor
(TFs) essential for developmental gliogenesis, such as SOX9, are required for the initiation of ZRFUS EPN
development. Barcode screening of these developmental TFs in our model identified ETV5 as a lead candidate
that is both necessary and sufficient for ZRFUS progression. Further examination of ETV5 function in EPN
revealed that it suppresses gene expression by promoting repressive chromatin states. Among the key target
genes repressed by ETV5 is Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent neurotransmitter, which we found functions to
suppress ZRFUS progression and remodel neuronal synapses in the peritumoral margins towards decreased
activity. Based on these compelling preliminary studies, we hypothesize that developmentally encoded TFs
govern tumor initiation and manipulate chromatin accessibility that regulate tumor-neuron interactions
in the brain microenvironment to drive EPN growth. This hypothesis will be tested in the following aims: 1)
Determine how SOX9 impacts ZRFUS EPN initiation through modifying chromatin accessibility, 2) Decipher the
role of ETV5 in ZRFUS EPN progression, and 3) Define the role of NPY in remodeling the ependymoma neuronal
microenvironment."

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed nearly every aspect of life. Research is beginning to document the
disproportionate impact of the pandemic on parents and children; however, much of the research does not
assess the multi-dimensional nature of the pandemic, evaluate long-term outcomes, or measure multiple
indices of well-being. In response to NOT-MH-21-330 (“Social, Behavioral, and Economic Impact of COVID-19
in Underserved and Vulnerable Populations”), our team of experts in parenting, family well-being, risk and
protective factors, and resilience, proposes to examine how parent and child well-being has been influenced by
the pandemic. In addition, we propose to leverage and expand upon data from a prospective, longitudinal
study (“Infant Growth and Development Study”, R01HD093662; R01HD110470 pending; PI: Leerkes) of 299
women and their infants, followed from pregnancy until children were 3.5 years old. We will recontact mothers
when children are 4 years old and conduct a timeline follow-back interview with mothers and coparents about
their COVID-related experiences to investigate how COVID has impacted parents’ and children’s well-being
over time. Our three Specific Aims will examine: (1) how COVID-related experiences (both stressors and
supports) impacted parent and child well-being across multiple dimensions during early childhood; (2)
racial/ethnic and household income disparities in the impact of COVID-related stressors across multiple
dimensions of well-being and potential protective factors (i.e., social support, supportive coparenting,
neighborhood quality); and (3) how timing of COVID-related stressors and supports influences parent and child
well-being. Parent outcomes will include social strain, positive parenting, economic strain, and physical and
mental health. Child outcomes will include socioemotional adjustment, pre-academic skills, and health. Data
will be assessed via parent report and interviewer observations. The proposal addresses critical knowledge
gaps including: an exclusive focus on negative COVID experiences, a focus on single or narrow domains of
parent and child well-being during the pandemic, and a lack of attention to heterogeneity in the impacts of the
pandemic across families. Results will have important implications for understanding which parents and
children need the most support in the current pandemic, as well as informing prevention and intervention
programs aiming to promote parent and child well-being in future pandemics."
10904836,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly one-million people in North America are now living with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and that number is
projected to rise to nearly 1.2 million by 2030. With advancements in neuromodulatory technologies, increasingly
more of these individuals elect to undergo deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery in order to control symptoms of
the disease, including refractory tremor, medication-induced dyskinesias, and PD-associated dystonia. The two
most common DBS neural targets for controlling these symptoms are the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi)
and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Recent meta-analyses have shown relative equivalence between these two
sites at controlling core PD symptoms. To date, there is not conclusive evidence regarding the potential impact
of DBS to GPi or STN on laryngeal-mediated functions of voice, swallowing, and cough, and consequently no
guidance on whether these outcomes should be considered when selecting DBS target. Therefore, the goal of
this application is to determine the impact of DBS neural target (STN versus GPi), lead location within the target,
laterality, and stimulation settings on voice, swallow and cough function in people with PD. The larynx is an
important player in each of these functions, and our central hypothesis is that spread of stimulation to
corticobulbar fibers in the genu of the internal capsule have deleterious effects on laryngeal motor
control, resulting in voice, swallow, and cough dysfunction. We have identified three specific aims for this
application: 1.) To compare laryngeal function during volitional voice tasks pre-post DBS, and when DBS
placement is bilateral versus unilateral for STN and GPi targets. 2.) To compare laryngeal function during
volitional and induced cough tasks pre-post DBS, and when DBS placement is bilateral versus unilateral for STN
and GPi targets. 3.) To compare airway safety associated with laryngeal onset, degree, and duration of maximum
closure during swallowing, pre-post DBS, and when DBS placement is bilateral versus unilateral for STN and
GPi targets. These hypotheses were developed based on compelling published and unpublished preliminary
data. We will accomplish these aims by enrolling people with PD who are being considered for DBS surgery,
and a control cohort with similar age, disease duration and severity, who are not currently being considered for
DBS surgery. We will measure physiologic, functional, and quality of life parameters of voice, swallow and cough
pre- and post-surgically (and at equivalently spaced time-points for the control group.) The realization of the
proposed aims is significant because it will address a substantial gap in our understanding of DBS outcomes
related to communication and airway protection, which are important in terms of morbidity, mortality, and quality
of life for patients with PD. The translational potential to provide additional guidance to DBS surgical teams
regarding whether voice, swallow or cough functions should be considered with selecting DBS target and/or
laterality is high. Ultimately, the project fits squarely within the overarching goal of the research team to deliver
the best possible care to people with PD."

The implementation of equitable health programs requires consideration and integration of gender and gender
analysis for such programs to achieve an impact on health outcomes and equity. The Applied Curriculum in
Gender and Equity Skills (ACES) will develop an applied educational curriculum to advance research and
implementation skills for gender analysis and integration in health globally (Aim 1). This curriculum will be
piloted and implemented through an online Accelerated Learning Institute at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)
(Aim 2). Over time, ACES will sustain a community of practice of gender specialists by leveraging existing
external and internal networks (Aim 3).
Building on existing successful courses on gender analysis, women’s leadership, women’s health, and gender-
based violence research methods, the ACES curriculum will be composed of a series of short, intense, online
courses offered through the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health to provide training in gender and health
equity. Courses will focus on applied methods, including using data to promote gender equity and health,
gender transformative interventions, gender budgeting, conducting gender situational analyses, gender
responsive monitoring and evaluation, and advocacy and communication for gender and health equity. The
curriculum will be grounded in real-world challenges and informed by leading-edge scholarship, with a diverse
faculty of experts in the field and a student body bringing lived experiences to the classroom. We will
incorporate anti-oppressive principles into our teaching and learning to create inclusive spaces that encourage
open participation. ACES will target current and future global public health professionals around the world, both
internal and external to JHU, seeking applied gender skills. We will provide full-tuition scholarships to external
participants, reducing barriers to entry for professional development in applied gender skills and enhancing
participant diversity. The ACES curriculum will strengthen students’ qualifications for obtaining gender
specialist positions in government, non-profits, and academia globally."
10897289,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 37 million Americans and increases the risk of end stage kidney
disease, cardiovascular disease, and premature mortality. Since its inception in 2001, the Chronic Renal
Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study has recruited and followed a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 5,625
participants with reduced kidney function at 7 Clinical Centers across the US. The original aim of CRIC was to
identify novel risk factors for CKD progression and cardiovascular disease among individuals with CKD. As the
landmark prospective cohort study of CKD, the CRIC Study has accomplished extensive biological,
physiological, and social phenotyping, longitudinal follow-up, and ascertainment of clinical and patient-centered
outcomes across multiple domains. Findings from the CRIC Study have defined trajectories of CKD
progression, catalogued the development and evolution of comorbidities in CKD, and identified a diverse array
of factors and pathways that explain the progression and complications of CKD in adults. Through its highly
productive Ancillary Studies and Opportunity Pool Programs, both the scientific scope of the CRIC Study and
the community of kidney disease researchers have been markedly expanded. During the most recent funding
cycle (Phase 4: 2018-2023), three innovative sub-protocol studies were implemented to enrich CRIC data with
highly granular home-based assessments of kidney function and cardiovascular measures. During the fifth and
final phase of the CRIC Study, the major focus will be to 1) ascertain the clinical outcomes for all participants
including those enrolled in the Phase 4 sub-protocols, 2) perform analyses linking the sub-protocol
measurements to clinical outcomes, 3) integrate data from multiple domains to identify sub-phenotypes
underlying the heterogeneity in CKD progression outcomes, 4) conduct final study visits for the full CRIC
cohort eligible for Phase 5, 5) create mechanisms for future data collection via linkages with external sources
of health data, and 6) generate tools and resources to facilitate the ongoing use of CRIC data and
biospecimens by a broad group of investigators after the study’s official end. To achieve the above goals, the
Tulane CRIC Clinical Center will reconsent and reenroll a high proportion of the 278 active study participants
into CRIC Phase 5; complete study visits and data collection with a stringent quality control process; actively
develop and participate in Ancillary Studies; maximize scientific productivity by leading and participating in
scientific presentations and publications; network with non-CRIC Study researchers to integrate CRIC data
with non-CRIC data to increase scientific output; provide training opportunities for the next generation of
researchers; and facilitate linkages between participant-level CRIC data and key external data sources to
enable the acquisition of additional data for future investigations. These proposed activities will generate new
scientific output and successfully transition the CRIC Study from its active prospective cohort phase to a long-
lasting resource for supporting ongoing and future mechanistic, epidemiologic, and translational investigations."

The overarching goal of this R25 Program is to leverage our rich institutional environment to iteratively develop
the materials and curricula necessary to train the first generation of neurologists how to systematically advance
both neurological care and research by prioritizing sex and gender considerations. From neurodevelopment to
neurodegeneration, sex and gender influence the risk and course of neurological diseases. It is essential that
neurologists provide care that is informed by a patient's reproductive goals and experiences, hormonal
transitions and treatments, and their gendered societal roles. However, we identified a significant national
training gap in these critical topics at all levels of neurology education and related key knowledge gaps in the
scientific literature that hinder the growth of this field. The SAGE (Sex- and Gender-Enriched) Neurology
Program at UCSF is designed to galvanize and integrate emerging clinical, educational and research efforts to
fill these important gaps through three key aims. These curricula and educational materials will initially target
UCSF neurology residency trainees (15 annually for a total class of 45) and UCSF medical students (165
annually) during core and/or selective neurology clerkships, as well as clinical fellows (20 annually). The
approach to curriculum development will be guided by the UCSF Center for Faculty Educators, using evidence-
based principles to optimize motivation, experiential learning, collaborative learning, and retention in adult mixed-
level learners. Our first objective (Aim 1) is to develop and implement a core best practices clinical curriculum
that accelerates the translation of SAGE principles into neurology clinical practice using both a core didactic for
all trainees, and a week-long selective for any interested trainee. Trainee participants' core clinical competency
and self-efficacy in providing neurological care informed by a patient's sex and gender will be systematically
evaluated. Our second objective (Aim 2) is to develop and implement a core research curriculum to train the next
generation of clinician-scientists to conduct and interpret neuroscience research by leveraging SAGE principles,
whether bench or bedside. We will develop and pilot a tool to apply a sex/gender lens to analyzing the design
and interpretation of basic, translational and clinical studies. We will evaluate learners' competency at using this
tool. Our third objective (Aim 3) is to promote active generation of new knowledge by pairing interested trainees
with a faculty mentor to develop and lead a quarterly interprofessional mentored inquiry workshops designed to
identify new areas of inquiry and create interprofessional research teams. Teams will then distil key points from
each session into publications and novel curricular materials that serve as evaluative benchmarks of success.
SAGE Neurology will transform the training of clinicians and clinician-scientists through the continued sustainable
long-term development, evaluation, and refinement of innovative, clinically-relevant curricular materials.
Curricular products will then be disseminated widely across UCSF departments, national academic neurology
programs, national neurological associations and the broader ORWH community."
10732739,"Abstract:
In this Fast Track SBIR application miRecule proposes to develop a muscle-specific platform (Muscle-NAVTM)
for the delivery of therapeutic oligonucleotide to treat inherited neuromuscular disorders. Over 50 inherited
neuromuscular disorders including myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and metabolic muscle disorders have
been identified with a monogenic underpinning, resulting from mutations in a single gene. Oligonucleotide
therapeutics offer the potential to correct many of these disorders by specifically targeting the mutated disease-
causing gene. A major limiting factor that remains is the ability to deliver effective doses of these large hydrophilic
molecules into affected muscle cells. Muscle-NAV will be composed of miRecule’s antibody technology directly
conjugated to a therapeutic oligonucleotide. The antibody will be targeted to a muscle expressed receptor that
induces uptake via endocytosis upon binding. Once endocytosed our novel protein and conjugation chemistry
aids in endosomal escape to the cytoplasm.
 The third most common inherited muscle disorder is facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD)
an orphan indication in the US, with about 20,000 patients. FSHD results from inherited mutations that lead to
inappropriate expression of the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene. The aberrant expression of DUX4 is severely
toxic to muscle tissues, resulting in oxidative stress and apoptosis of muscle cells degrading muscle function.
DUX4 is a transcription factor and is not directly “druggable” by traditional small molecules or biologic
therapeutics. Several studies have displayed that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy has the potential to
directly repress DUX4, reversing muscle pathology in pre-clinical models. However, a significant hurdle for the
development is an effective means of delivery. To validate our Muscle-NAV platform we propose to deliver our
(ASO) targeting DUX4 (miRecule candidate MC-DX4) for the treatment of FSHD.
 In phase 1 of the fast track SBIR, we will first discover novel antibodies for ten receptors with selective
muscle expression through phage display screening (AIM 1). We will demonstrate selective delivery and
knockdown in muscle cells in vitro (AIM 2). Then screen five conjugates for muscle specific biodistribution,
effective delivery and knockdown in an FSHD mouse model, and safety in mice to select a single lead antibody
conjugate for Muscle-NAV (AIM 3). In phase 2 of the fast track SBIR, we will optimize scale-up, process
development, and CMC release tests for Muscle-NAV and MC-DX4 (AIM 4). We will use this high-quality agent
to characterize PK profiles in Non-Human Primates (NHPs), PK/PD profiles in a mouse model of FSHD, and
MTD/ Dosing Range/TK profiles in rats (AIM 5). We will also demonstrate the competitive advantage and long-
term therapeutic efficacy of MC-DX4 in two mouse models of FSHD (AIM 6). The completion of these studies
will create a compelling data package we will use to market co-development and licensing deals for our Muscle-
NAV platform, and enable our pre-IND meeting for MC-DX4 as an effective treatment for FSHD."
10881784,"PDX CORE SUMMARY
The Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) Core is the epicenter of the Washington University PDX Development and
Trial Center (WU-PDTC). It will be responsible for the development, organization, characterization, storage, and
dissemination of high quality pathogen free PDX models for research projects investigating anticancer agents,
within and outside of WU-PDTC. Leveraging prior success and streamlined and efficient infrastructure, the PDX
Core will continue PDX development with a focus on creation of high-value specimens from biologically
prioritized specimens (e.g. treatment resistant cases). The Human and Mouse Linked Evaluation of Tumors
(HAMLET) PDX Core at the Institute of Clinical and Translational Study (ICTS) and the Solid Tumor Tissue Bank
and Registry (STTBR) led by Drs. Li and Fields, respectively, have a proven record of success in generating
PDX models from a wide variety of cancers and in utilizing these models for drug testing. These synergistic
programs have generated >1,000 models from >15 solid tumors, including large cohorts of recalcitrant cases
(e.g. treatment resistant pancrcreatic and triple-negative breast cancer) and genomically similar (e.g. HER-2
amplified) solid tumors that have led to multiple clinical trials in the ETCTN. These existing models will become
part of the renewal WU-PDTC, where ~400 new PDX models will be developed and added to this collection. The
new PDX models will further enhance our capability to support ongoing projects and open new opportunities for
research in clinically prioritized cancer themes. Taking advantage of the strong proteogenomic capability within
the proposed WU-PDTC and WUSM, we will expand the characterization of these PDX models to include cutting-
edge genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. This will provide investigators with a more
comprehensive picture of the mutational profiles, the molecular signatures, clonal structures, and heterogeneities
of the models to help with cancer sub-typing and target selection. Besides research projects at WU-PDTC, PDX
models in the PDX Core collection will also be shared with other PDTCs and made broadly available to
authorized non-network investigators. Existing infrastructure copuled with the large clinical oncology program at
WU and exceptionally strong institutional support, including matching funds, will ensure that the goals of the WU-
PDTC PDX Core goals are achievable."
10881786,"BIOINFORMATICS CORE: SUMMARY
The Bioinformatics Core will support the WU-PDTC Research Projects and Cores over the spectrum of their
computational biology needs. The research program we propose involves many facets of algorithms,
computation, and information management, which require formalized bioinformatics support to effectively
translate results into recommendations for human clinical trials. The Bioinformatics Core will provide both the
infrastructure to house the experimental data and the interpretive tools and personnel to analyze these data.
These responsibilities fall into 3 basic categories. This will enable scaling the PDX-based approach into a
significant resource for the cancer research community in three important ways: (1) provide uniform, high-quality,
proteogenomic characterization for all WU-PDTC PDX tumor models for curation into the public domain, (2)
provide therapeutic response data on PDX models (e.g., breast, colon, pancreatic, and lung) including correlation
with molecular characterization and phenotypic response that may be applied to other cancer types with similar
characteristics, and (3) provide informatic and biostatistical tools to support evidence-based selection of
promising agents for subsequent clinical trials based on known molecular and clinical data. We will organize all
of this information, as well as all PDX-associated metadata (e.g. molecular and histopathologic data for both the
patient and PDX tumors, passages, and therapeutic experimental data, etc.), time series metrics representing
treatment responses, etc. in an extension of our WU-PDXdb relational tracking database developed in the prior
funding period. This will support both our local analysis and submission obligations and the information
integration with other PDTCs and PTCCCs. These informatic and statistical tools will be integrated across the
PDXNet to provide a valuable and lasting resource for future clinical and pre-clinical trial designs and possible
repurposing of drugs across cancer types."
10881787,"SHARED RESOURCES CORE: SUMMARY
The Shared Resources Core (SRC) is structured as a physical shared resource that will support both Research
Projects, the PDX Core, as well as pilot and trans-Network projects. The most critical goal of the SRC is to
provide services and resources that are either unavailable to individual research teams within PDXNet or that
are unable to meet the cost, technical, and speed requirements of the Projects and other components at WU-
PDTC. Other important missions for the SRC include optimization of the procedures for project/sample-specific
requirements, standardization of the assays to ensure data consistency, and incorporation of the latest
technologies. This centralized arrangement takes full advantage of the expertise and infrastructure existing at
our institute developed through participation in several large-scale NIH consortia, including HTAN (Human Tumor
Atlas Network), SenNet (Senescence Network), GUDMAP (GenitoUrinary Development Molecular Anatomy
Project), CPTAC (Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium), PE-CGS (Participant Engagement and
Cancer Genome Sequencing), CRIP (Co-Clinical Imaging Research Program), and PDXNet, in order to increase
effectiveness and efficiency, avoid duplicated effort, and reduce stress on individual projects. SRC will be tightly
integrated with the Research Projects, Pilot and Trans-Network Projects, the PDX Core, and the Bioinformatics
Core under the supervision of the Administrative Core. Detailed characterization of the PDX tumors at the DNA,
RNA, and protein levels will be important for validation, model selection, revelation of molecular changes in
response to treatment, illustration of mechanisms of treatment resistance, as well as the identification of
biomarkers and targets for future treatment testing. To accomplish these goals, the SRC will work with the
Research Projects and other Cores to perform two main types of assays: Omics and imaging. For omics, the
SRC will cover bulk and single cell omics, including whole exome sequencing (WES), bulk RNA-seq, single
nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq (snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq), spatial transcriptomics (Visium), as well as
global proteomics and phospho-proteomics. For imaging, the SRC covers multiplex target imaging
(CODEX/Phenocycler), in vivo preclinical molecular and radiologic imaging, and standard immunofluorescence
(IF) staining. The SRC is also tasked with adjusting to the changing needs of the projects as well as introducing
new technologies and tools to assist the Projects and to accomplish the mission of the center."
10881788,"RESEARCH PROJECT 1 - SUMMARY
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly growing class of chemotherapy drugs designed to deliver cancer
cell specific cytotoxic payloads. Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (DS-8201a) is a pioneer next generation ADC
comprised of trastuzumab attached to a topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitor payload via a unique cleavable linker.
DS-8201a is under active investigation for the treatment of multiple cancer types, and has received FDA approval
for several indications, including advanced HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or ISH+) and more recently the HER2-low
(IHC 1+, 2+/ISH-) breast cancer (BC). However, a subset of patients with HER2 IHC 0 BC also responded to
DS-8201a in clinical trials. The immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay routinely used in the clinic is inadequate in
distinguishing the lower ranges of HER2 expression. Development of a more quantitative HER2 assay is an
unmet need. Using multiple-reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) proteomic approach, our
collaborator Dr. Amanda Paulovich has developed a CLIA assay which is capable of detecting a large range of
HER2 expression in BCs that are HER2-low or HER2 0 by conventional IHC. In this proposal, we will examine
the utility of this assay in predicting DS-8201a efficacy in “HER2 low” BC, defined by HER2 IHC 0-2+/ISH-. We
hypothesize that HER2 expression quantified by the MRM-MS could predict DS-8201a activity. Another area of
unmet clinical need that this project addresses is to develop mechanism-based strategies to improve the efficacy
of DS-8201a for HER2 low tumors since they often derive less benefit from DS-8201a monotherapy. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that inhibitors against components of the DNA damage response and repair
pathway (DDRi) could enhance the anti-tumor effect of DS-8201a. In Aim 1, we will examine whether the HER2
expression by MRM-MS and DDR pathway alterations predict response to single agent DS-8201a using 100
HER2 low BC PDX derived organoid models. Drug response in organoids will be validated in selected PDX
models in vitro. In Aim 2, we will determine whether DDRi, including the PARPi (olaparib), ATRi (AZD6738),
ATMi (AZ1930), BERi (TRC-102), and DNA-PKi (M3814), enhances the anti-tumor effect of DS-8201a in HER2
low BC in vitro and in vivo. We will investigate treatment effects of DDRi and DS-8201a, alone or in combination,
on HER2 level, markers of DNA damage, apoptosis, and on the transcriptome and proteome/phosphoproteome.
We will also perform spatial transcriptomics and snRNA sequencing of selected PDX models to analyze intra-
tumor heterogeneity in treatment response. In Aim 3, we will examine whether DDRi enhances the anti-tumor
activity of DS-8201a in HER2 low colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. By assessing
the utility of a quantitative HER2 assay and proteogenomic analyses of DDR pathway, we aim to improve the
selection of patients likely to respond to DS-8201a in future trials. Results from the PDX and organoid testing of
DDRi in combination with DS-8201a will likely lead to the design of biomarker directed clinical trials."
10733145,"SUMMARY
Consumption of seafood is a significant route of human exposure to persistent, teratogenic pollutants. Of concern
are exposures that occur early in life, with adverse reproductive, teratogenic, neurological, cardiovascular, and
immune outcomes. Effective prediction of the risks associated with these exposures requires an understanding
of mechanisms of bioaccumulation and developmental toxicity. The goals of Project 3 are to determine structural
and functional mechanisms of organohalogen interaction with Xenobiotic Transporters (XTs) and to determine
their developmental toxicity on the nascent germ line, a sensitive and relevant target of exposure. Such
mechanistic studies inform our understanding of how emerging pollutants, such as microbial transformation
products, are transferred from the environment, to seafood, and ultimately to humans. The Aims of this proposal
utilize knockout and transgenic sea urchins to determine the role of marine transporters in pollutant
accumulation, as well as biophysical and structural characterization of human, fish and sea urchin transporters
to precisely define their mechanisms of pollutant interaction. In parallel, we will use high throughput approaches
with sea urchin embryos and human cells to define developmental targets of these compounds. This study is
based on innovative approaches including development of novel marine models, high-throughput/high-content
imaging, the use of cryo-electron microscopy of XTs across different species of fish, and the generation of
synthetically evolved nanobodies. The results and resources have impact for a wide range of problems
developmental biology, pharmacology and toxicology, providing a foundation of knowledge necessary for
determining safe limits for seafood consumption."
10893488,"Coronary artery calcium (CAC) testing provides a direct measure of an individual’s atherosclerotic burden that
is robustly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Accordingly, CAC scoring has a IIa
recommendation in the 2018 AHA/ACC Cholesterol Treatment and 2019 ACC/AHA Primary Prevention
Guidelines and is also recommended by many other national and international guidelines for the allocation of
primary prevention medications. The clinical implications of the Agatston score can vary significantly based on
the age, sex, and race/ethnicity population percentile score, which is particularly crucial for estimating long-
term or lifetime CVD risk, especially for younger persons in whom a low Agatston score may commonly be
reflective of premature atherosclerosis and significantly increased lifetime risk. However, current guideline-
recommended CAC percentile scores were developed from only one NHLBI cohort comprised of
predominantly middle-aged participants and there is no centralized website or resource with all the available
tools to facilitate interpretation of the CAC score. Consequently, there is an unmet need to 1) develop CAC
percentile data across the lifespan that is more representative of the US population and more diverse across
racial/ethnic minorities, particularly South Asians, who have a significantly increased CVD risk yet are not
included in current percentile score calculators and 2) create a centralized website and mobile app to aid in the
interpretation of CAC at the point of care. Therefore, using standardized data harmonization techniques, we
propose to pool data from 7 NHBLI cohorts and 3 real-world clinically-derived cohorts to create the gender-
balanced, racially/ethnically diverse CAC Synthetic Cohort Lifetime Pooling Project (CACSC-LPP) of
approximately 20,000 NHBLI participants with CAC data across the lifespan (age 30-95 years old) and an
additional ~90,000 participants from clinical CAC cohorts. Harmonizing the individual participant level data will
pragmatically leverage the enormous NIH investment (monetary and time) in these cohorts to create a new
pooled dataset that expands the clinical impact beyond what was originally envisioned. It will also create an
ideal foundation to iteratively expand the CACSC-LPP to ensure better representation for all persons living in
the US, with an initial focus on South Asians. Additionally, we will build upon our prototype CAC-tools website
and companion app so that clinicians and patients can enter a CAC score (plus any other available risk factor
data) and retrieve their CAC percentile. This website/app will serve as the definitive source for all CAC related
tools and would be well positioned to be endorsed by future national CVD guidelines (see LOS, Drs. Lloyd-
Jones & Arnett). Through the creation of the 1) CACSC-LPP, 2) CAC percentile calculator across the lifespan,
and 3) centralized CAC website/app this project will improve personalized CVD risk prediction, implementation
of ACC/AHA primary prevention recommendations, while also creating the infrastructure for multidisciplinary
and cross-institutional collaborations to further improve our understanding of CAC for CVD risk prediction."
10932918,"Project Summary
Developing novel technologies for identifying and quantifying transient protein-protein interactions is critical in
basic research and medical biotechnology. Protein kinases represent a focal group among strategic drug
targets for treating numerous hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Yet, creating high-resolution
sensors to detect, quantify, and analyze the plasticity of diverse kinome members in a broad dynamic range of
interactions remains difficult. This challenge is exacerbated because the kinase superfamily members vary
drastically in their complexity. To address this long-standing technological shortcoming, we will formulate,
develop, and validate a new class of generalizable and highly specific nanopore sensors (nanosensors) for
kinase analytics. The key innovating aspect of this design is fusing a generic protein recognition ligand with a
transmembrane protein nanopore. This approach will employ a robust nanostructure made of a single
polypeptide entity with no requirement for an additional tail or other exogenous tags. The binding interface of
the protein recognition ligand is interchangeable to accommodate the required specificity for a targeted kinase,
whereas the nanopore facilitates the generation of a reporting electrical signal. A protein kinase analyte in
solution produces a unique electrical signature that varies with its identity and quantity. The reporting signal is
mediated by the ligand-kinase assembly at the nanopore tip. In these studies, kinase recognition events will be
discriminated at single-molecule precision without the necessity of using complex data analysis algorithms.
This engineering strategy substantially broadens the spectrum of applications of these nanosensors to various
kinases and their interactions. Our preliminary studies prove the power of this approach by creating a single-
molecule nanosensor platform that probes and quantifies structurally and functionally diverse proteins beyond
the fundamental limit of sensing inside the nanopore. In addition, such a tactic will enable the detection of
competing binding interactions of kinase isoforms against the same recognition ligand. These generalizable
nanosensors permit integration into scalable devices, representing versatile elements for small-molecule
inhibitor screening and drug discovery pipelines. Further project developments will be aimed at maintaining a
high performance of these nanosensors in a complex biofluid. Therefore, they can be utilized using realistic
samples, having prospects in molecular diagnostics. The expected immediate outcomes of this project will be
the following: (i) the development of high-affinity nanosensors for ultrasensitive analysis of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs); (ii) the creation of genetically-encoded nanosensors for probing serine-threonine kinases
(STKs); (iii) the detection and analysis of kinases in multiplexed settings and biofluids. These studies will
impact healthcare by providing tools and a fundamental framework in biosensor technology, synthetic biology,
and single-molecule enzymology."
10844414,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is precisely controlled to satisfy neuronal metabolic demands. Active neurons signal
to the vasculature via multiple neurovascular coupling mechanisms to increase regional blood flow in a
phenomenon known as functional hyperemia (FH). The hyperemic response increases the frictional forces
imposed by blood flow onto endothelial cells (ECs) of arterioles and capillaries. We have recently demonstrated
that the Piezo1 channel is a crucial mechanosensor in brain capillary ECs, and that it mediates Ca2+ signals in
response to mechanical stimuli. However, the impact of Piezo1 signaling on CBF control remains unknown. In
response to the NIH Notice of Special Interest (NOT-AT-21-002) “Promoting Research on Interoception and Its
Impact on Health and Disease,” we provide compelling preliminary evidence that Piezo1-mediated interoception
is crucial in CBF regulation, and that this mechanism is compromised during hypertension. Building on our
preliminary data, we aim to test the overarching hypothesis that cerebrovascular Piezo1 regulates CBF at the
local capillary level and at the large-scale level in extended brain regions. Aim 1 will employ EC-specific
genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator mice, widefield and two-photon fluorescence imaging to determine the spatial,
temporal, and spread characteristics of Piezo1-mediated Ca2+ transients in brain capillaries. Moreover, we will
use genetic and pharmacological approaches to determine if Ca2+ signaling mediated by Piezo1 is coupled to
the production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide to increase local capillary blood flow. In Aim 2, we will
determine how large-scale Piezo1 activation during FH triggers a cationic conductance, which dampens
hyperpolarization-mediated FH, much like a built-in brake system. To achieve this goal, we will use genetically
engineered mice with reduced Piezo1 activity in all ECs or brain ECs, along with near infrared laser imaging,
and laser doppler flowmetry. In Aim 3, we will determine if cerebrovascular Piezo1 signaling is compromised in
hypertension and whether a Piezo1 channelopathy-like effect leads ultimately to CBF deficits. We will directly
measure Piezo1 channel activity and CBF in two mouse models of hypertension and in genetically engineered
transgenic mice that harbor a human Piezo1 mutation. Use of this mutation is clinically relevant, in that PIEZO1
mutations are prevalent in African Americans, a population with the highest prevalence of hypertension
worldwide. Completion of this project will support the concept that Piezo1 is crucial in CBF regulation, and that
alteration of its activity is a novel risk factor for CBF decline. This work will further provide new therapeutic targets
for improving CBF in cardiovascular disease."
10868774,"Abstract
The goal of this project is to determine the extent to which cardiovascular stress physiology in midlife relates
to the severity of preclinical cerebrovascular disease. This goal aligns with NOT-HL-23-002 and the NHLBI
Strategic Vision, which emphasize a need to understand midlife cardiovascular contributions to later life
dementias. Focusing on cardiovascular stress physiology in midlife follows from cumulative evidence
indicating that individuals with a phenotypic tendency to react to acute psychological stressors with
relatively large rises in blood pressure (stressor-evoked blood pressure reactivity) are at risk for
hypertension and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, which themselves are midlife cardiovascular risk factors
for cerebrovascular disease and later life dementias. The mechanistic pathways by which stressor-evoked
blood pressure reactivity may confer cerebrovascular risk are unknown. They are hypothesized in this
project to include peripheral vascular remodeling and dysfunction, manifesting as arterial stiffness,
endothelial dysfunction, and impaired beat-to-beat hemodynamic control. The latter are further
hypothesized to promote preclinical cerebrovascular disease via a substrate for neurovascular damage;
namely, cerebral pulsatility. To test predictions from these as yet unevaluated hypotheses, 3 Specific Aims
are pursued in a community cohort of 538 midlife adults (aged 40-59 years; ~60% women, ~40%
identifying as nonwhite; final analytic N=450 expected after attrition) who are asymptomatic for clinical
cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. In a 2-visit protocol, volunteers will complete validated
and reliable protocols to assess: behavioral, social, and biological determinants of cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular health; arterial stiffness, endothelial function, and beat-to-beat hemodynamic control;
cardiovascular stress reactivity; and, cerebral pulsatility and preclinical cerebrovascular disease. Aim 1 tests
whether larger stressor-evoked cardiovascular (blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral
resistance) reactions relate to preclinical cerebrovascular disease markers (greater cerebral pulsatility,
higher white matter lesion burden, decreased hippocampal volume, and increased enlargement of brain
perivascular spaces) in a multivariate structural equation model. Aim 2 tests whether associations between
stressor-evoked cardiovascular reactions and preclinical cerebrovascular disease markers are partly
explained by arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and beat-to-beat hemodynamic control. Tertiary
Aim 3 explores whether Aim 1-2 effects are moderated by known cardiovascular risks and sex as a biological
variable. The proposed project seeks to characterize the extent to which cardiovascular stress reactivity in
midlife is a specific cardiovascular source of risk for cerebrovascular disease. In this way, the new
information from this project may identify a potentially modifiable and stress-related factor in midlife that
could aid efforts to predict and reduce vascular sources of later life dementia risk."
10917282,"Defects of the anterior segment (AS) tissue lead to a group of highly debilitating eye disorders referred to as Anterior
Segment Dysgenesis (ASD). ASD represents one of the leading causes of congenital corneal opacity and leads to glaucoma
in ~50% of the cases and are often associated with myopia. Although few causative genes have been identified, little is
known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tissue malformation in this class of diseases. Several
ciliopathies including Meckel, Bardet Biedl, and Joubert syndromes display conditions affecting tissues of the AS including
severe myopia. We have recently reported that conditional ablation of the primary cilium in neural crest cells (NCC) leads
to ASD in the mouse model with conditions similar to those observed in humans. We have shown that primary cilia of the
neural crest derived POM mediate the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. However, our preliminary results suggest that the cilium
could play distinct roles in a tissue specific manner important for AS morphogenesis and repair. The objective of the
proposed study is to elucidate the signaling pathways and cellular mechanisms orchestrated by ciliary proteins during
morphogenesis of the cornea and other AS structures. Specifically, we will test our central working hypothesis that primary
cilia enable neural crest-derived cells of the POM to interpret local morphogenetic cues and elicit distinct cellular behaviors
during morphogenesis and repair of different structures of the AS. To test this hypothesis, we have generated specific genetic
and computational tools and developed an in vivo imaging approach that will allow us to a) elucidate overlapping and
distinct roles of primary cilia and the Hh pathway during the development and repair of AS tissues; b) To identify signaling
networks downstream of the primary cilium relevant for AS morphogenesis, and c) conduct a functional characterization of
a novel cilia-dependent cell population of the pNC lineage with chondrogenic capabilities. Collectively, the outcome of this
work will reveal the integrative role of primary cilia signaling necessary to achieve normal AS morphogenesis. Importantly,
delineation of the cilia-related signaling cascades will enable the identification of new therapeutic strategies to treat ASD
and trauma."
10911334,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Female pelvic floor disorders (PFD) which include urinary incontinence (UI) are a major public health problem
affecting women of all ages in the United States with significant negative impact on quality of life. Stress
urinary incontinence (SUI), the most common type of UI, is defined as the complaint of involuntary urine
leakage on effort or exertion, including coughing, sneezing or lifting. Pelvic floor integrity is an important
predictor of SUI. The pelvic floor musculature is involved in the support of pelvic organs and micturition.
Voluntary contractions of these muscle groups enable control of the urethral sphincter to maintain urinary
continence during stress maneuvers. SUI results from weakness of the pelvic floor musculature, fascia and
ligaments. Recent studies have shown that androgens may play an important role in pelvic floor and lower
urinary tract integrity, as the muscles in these structures are androgen-sensitive and express large numbers of
androgen receptors in both animals and humans. In preclinical models, exogenous testosterone administration
results in greater increases in pelvic floor muscle mass compared to any other skeletal muscle group,
underscoring the high sensitivity of this muscle to androgens. In female animal models of experimentally-
induced SUI, testosterone therapy increases pelvic floor muscle mass and improves urodynamic parameters.
Observational studies in women with polycystic ovary syndrome who have high testosterone levels show both
greater pelvic floor muscle mass and strength as well as fewer UI symptoms compared to controls. Taken
together, these data suggest that testosterone has direct anabolic effects on pelvic floor muscles which may
provide a therapeutic option in women with SUI. The anabolic effect of testosterone supplementation on pelvic
floor muscles in patients with stress urinary incontinence has not been studied in women.
The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of testosterone supplementation in increasing the
muscles of the pelvic floor in a double-blind, randomized-controlled trial in older postmenopausal women with
stress urinary incontinence. We will also assess the efficacy of testosterone supplementation on urodynamic
function, urinary symptoms and quality of life. We propose a 12-week double-blind, randomized-controlled,
proof-of-concept trial to determine the efficacy of testosterone supplementation versus placebo in women age
60 years and older with stress urinary incontinence. The following outcomes will be measured: 1) pelvic floor
muscle volume with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, 2) urodynamic function with urodynamic studies, and
3) urinary symptoms and quality of life. Current treatments available for female SUI center largely on surgical
interventions and few seek to restore integrity to the dynamic supports of continence. Thus, there is a clear
need for innovation to provide a wider range of effective treatment options for women with SUI. If this trial
confirms benefits of testosterone therapy, female patients with SUI will have an inexpensive, relatively safe and
easy to administer medication available that has the potential to transform the care of these patients."

10901948,"Summary
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) binds to full-length tropomyosin receptor kinase (TrkB.FL), inducing its
dimerization and activation. This activates many signaling cascades that cooperatively promote neuronal survival
and regulate neuronal development and synaptic transmission in many brain regions. This signaling pathway is
also critical for the control of energy balance, as mutations in the TrkB.FL kinase domain or BDNF lead to
hyperphagia and severe obesity in mice and humans. In addition to TrkB.FL, the Ntrk2 gene produces two
truncated receptors, a predominant TrkB.T1 and a minor TrkB.T2 (we use TrkB.T to refer both isoforms). TrkB.T
has a short intracellular sequence and lacks the tyrosine kinase domain. Neurons mainly express TrkB.FL,
whereas astrocytes only express TrkB.T. While binding of BDNF to TrkB.T1 induces Ca2+ signals and activates
Rho GTPase in cultured astrocytes, it remains unclear if astrocytic TrkB.T plays a role in the control of energy
balance. We generated astrocyte specific Ntrk2 conditional knockout (aNtrk2 cKO) mice where Ntrk2 deletion
starts at 5 weeks of age and abolishes TrkB.T expression in astrocytes. We found that the Ntrk2 deletion in
mature astrocytes blocked astrocytic reactivity in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) and gave mice
total resistance to diet-induced obesity (DIO) by reducing energy intake and increasing energy expenditure. In
addition to nutritional and trophic support to neurons, astrocytes contact synapses through their processes to
regulate synaptic transmission by taking up neurotransmitters from the synaptic cleft and releasing
gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Thus, we hypothesize that TrkB.T-mediated Ca2+ signals promote
astrocytic reactivity in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, which in turn disrupts astrocytic support to neurons
and astrocytic regulation of synapses and shifts energy homeostasis to energy surplus. Our studies will focus
on astrocytes, AgRP/NPY neurons, and POMC neurons in the ARH. We propose to examine the impact of Ntrk2
gene deletion on astrocytes in the ARH (Aim 1), to determine the impact of astrocytic Ntrk2 deletion on neurons
and synaptic transmission (Aim 2), to identify the site where astrocytic TrkB.T ablation blocks diet-induced
obesity (Aim 3), and to determine if attenuating astrocytic Ca2+ signals can prevent obesity in HFD-fed mice (Aim
4). In conclusion, this research project will test several novel concepts, including a crucial role for TrkB.T-
mediated Ca2+ signals in induction of astrocytic reactivity, an active role for TrkB.T in the regulation of energy
balance, and altered astrocytic regulation of synaptic transmission in HFD-fed mice. Our studies will likely show
that attenuating TrkB.T-mediated Ca2+ signals in astrocytes can be a novel and effective strategy for therapeutic
interventions of DIO, the most common form of obesity in humans."
10912815,"ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of adipose tissue
establishment, maintenance, and pathophysiological remodeling. Our central hypothesis is that adipose tissue
plasticity involves the creation and resolution of dynamic adipogenic niches involving close interactions among
specific stromal and immune cell subtypes. While single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has identified the
stromal and immune phenotypes that are involved in adipose tissue neogenesis, how these cells are recruited
to specific locations and interact to create and resolve adipogenic niches has not been addressed. In this
continuation we will use cutting edge high-dimension, high-resolution spatial transcriptomics and proteomics to
map, order, and test the cellular events underlying adipose tissue neogenesis.
Despite recent advances in single cell profiling, the origins of adipocytes and lineage relationships of stromal
cells in adipose tissues remains controversial. To address this critical gap in knowledge we will apply newly-
developed CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies for unbiased, high-dimension resolution of cell lineages during
the life cycle of adipose tissues. This technology will be integrated with complementary techniques of spatial
transcriptomics, multiplexed 3-dimensional single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization and
immunofluorescence. This integrated approach will provide comprehensive, unbiased spatial analysis of
lineage relationships in postnatal adipose tissue establishment, expansion, aging, and remodeling in vivo.
Successful completion of this proposal will provide the first unbiased high-dimension, single-cell resolution map
of mouse adipose tissues during establishment, expansion, and aging. We will determine the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of adipogenic niche formation and resolution, and resolve long-standing questions of
cell lineages in a comprehensive and unbiased fashion."
10906226,"Moderate anemia (hemoglobin < 11 g/dl) occurs 1.5% – 2.0% of the general population. In young and middle-
aged adults, iron deficiency from blood loss represents the dominant mechanism and is heavily over-
represented in women and minority populations. Iron deficiency anemia’s (IDA) negative impact on pediatric
brain function is well established, but its consequences on adult brains are underappreciated. Our preliminary
data demonstrates significant (one standard deviation) deficits in visual and verbal memory, fluid and
visuospatial reasoning, and verbal learning. We also demonstrate decreased cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
and abnormal blood brain barrier permeability to water that suggest impaired microvascular blood flow
regulation in the brain. The overarching goal for this study is to deeply phenotype the cognitive and
cerebrovascular derangements caused by adult-onset IDA and to determine their reversibility with iron
replacement therapies. We will recruit 96 women ages 14-60 years diagnosed with moderate IDA, and 40
healthy control subjects from four donor centers in the Los Angeles area as well as women recruited from
social media. Most of these subjects will be otherwise entirely healthy but we will exclude individuals with other
mechanisms for their anemia as well as risk factors for small vessel disease including hypertension, sleep
disordered breathing, and diabetes. All anemic and control subjects will undergo comprehensive
cerebrovascular MRI, baseline bloodwork, patient reported outcomes, and neurocognitive testing.
Aims 1 and 2 focus on careful characterization of the cognitive, metabolic, flow, oxygenation, and connectivity
changes in response to IDA. These data will provide new insights into the neuroscientific basis for cognitive
dysfunction in IDA. Aim 3 is interventional; we will restudy all the previously acquired biomarkers after
normalizing hemoglobin level to prove reversibility/irreversibility of the MRI and cognitive deficits.
All patients with confirmed moderate IDA will be randomized to intravenous ferric carboxymaltose versus
standard-of-care therapy (referral to primary care physician for oral iron therapy). The primary endpoint will be
the cerebral metabolic rate by MRI and neurocognition at 12 months. Secondary markers include regional
brain blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, tissue oxygenation, blood-brain barrier function, and functional
connectivity. Exploratory markers include brain iron deposition, white matter damage, and brain morphometry.
We will exploit the rapid correction of iron sufficiency in the IV iron treated subjects to uncouple the relative
impacts of iron and anemia. We posit that all subjects who successfully replace their iron stores will normalize
their MRI and cognitive function. However, we anticipate that iron restoration and durability in the standard-of-
care arm will not be as robust as for intravenous iron because of poor compliance, insufficient therapy duration,
and/or lack of adequate medical follow-up. Taken together, this study will determine the urgency of identifying
and correcting IDA in adults, the mechanisms of brain toxicity, and potential targets to improve care practices."

For stable patients, this monitoring is often unnecessary, whereas for higher-risk patients, vital sign monitoring
every 4-6 hours is often not adequate. To address this need, we will leverage one of the largest, most diverse
clinical datasets in the country, using electronic health record (EHR) data from 2.4M hospitalized patients to
generate machine learning (ML) predictive models, designed to optimize patient monitoring. We will use
continuous monitoring (CM) devices to identify in advance patients likely to deteriorate and specify the clinical
underlying reasons of deterioration to enable timely interventions. We have applied and published similar ML
approaches on other cohorts, including: 1) deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to avoid unnecessary
overnight vitals; 2) deep learning models that use continuous monitoring data to predict clinical alerts up to 4
hours ahead of time; and 3) natural language processing on medical notes and unsupervised clustering of
patients. Our approach involves collecting prospectively CM data from a targeted population of 2,000
hospitalized patients, and developing and validating models, both retrospectively and prospectively. Our
approach will allow us to: Identify stable patients admitted on the medical-surgical wards to optimize
vital signs monitoring. We will train a RNN model using EHR data from 2.4M hospitalizations, to predict, after
vital signs are measured, stable patients for the next 8 hours, and enable eliminating the next vitals
measurement. We retrospectively will validate the model, using cross-affiliation validation, and prospectively,
silently validate it in 5 different hospitals. Develop a clinical deterioration algorithm, based on continuous
monitoring data and clinical hard outcomes. We will collect prospective data from a targeted population of
2,000 inpatients, who are admitted on medical-surgical floors in our largest hospital, with a modified early
warning score higher than 5. The CM patches will start collecting data upon admission. We will use combined
clinical hard outcomes (death, intubation, cardiac arrest, unplanned ICU transfer, RRTs) to train two deep-
learning models to predict deterioration up to 4 hours and up to 24 hours before. Define the early and late
phenotypic substrates of hospitalized patient deterioration. Using the clinical data of 56K deteriorated
patients from Aim 1 (EHR variables and extracted presenting symptoms) 4 hour and 24 hours prior to
deterioration, we will perform unsupervised cluster analysis to identify unique clusters linked to phenotypes of
deterioration. We will associate derived phenotype groups to clinical outcomes and treatments, to inform more
targeted treatment and intervention strategies. We aim to develop new tools to align patient needs with
resources, and deliver more efficient, effective, personalized, and proactive care to hospitalized patients."
10746870,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by b-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-
limiting step in production of Ab, whose deposition is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Despite a rapidly growing burden of health care for the aging United States, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how trafficking and mutations of APP influence neuronal function and contribute to
AD pathogenesis. Continued existence of this gap represents a critical problem because, until it is filled,
AD prevention and treatment based on molecular understanding of the disease progression remains
inaccessible. Since neurons can grow axons that are up to a meter long, continuous imaging of APP
trafficking and processing in live neurons at the single-molecule level requires extremely photostable
fluorophores. Our lab has recently developed a new class of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) that
are immensely photostable over months. The overall objective of this project is to use our novel
photostable UCNPs to perform single-molecule imaging of the trafficking and processing of APP in live
human induced neurons (iNs) – an excellent model system as many human diseases are not fully
recapitulated in mouse neurons. The central hypothesis is that mutations of APP lead to impaired axonal
transport and render APP more vulnerable for b-cleavage by BACE-1. This hypothesis has been
formulated on the basis of previous work on culture mouse neurons and transgenic mouse models. The
rationale for the proposed research is that ultralong-term single molecule imaging of WT and mutant APP
in human iNs will reveal axonal transport defects caused by AD-associated mutations, providing
important insights into their relationship to AD. Guided by strong preliminary data on the novel
experimental platform, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the three specific aims: 1) Measure the
trafficking dynamics of endocytosed APP in human iNs; 2) Determine how axonal transport is impaired
by mutations of APP in human iNs; and 3) Visualize the association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 in
human iNs. A battery of techniques including single-molecule imaging, nanotechnology, biochemistry
and stem cell technology will be used to interrogate APP trafficking. The approach is innovative because
it departs from the status quo by utilizing extremely photostable UCNPs to perform long-term single-
molecule tracking, novel analysis for non-invasive determination of motor number, and the use of human
induced neurons. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to characterize in depth
the trafficking and association dynamics of APP and BACE-1 with unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution, as well as uncover the extent to which APP mutations impair axonal transport, thereby
shedding light on future prevention and treatment of AD."

The recent development of continuous directed evolution (CDE) methods has made it increasingly possible to
generate biomolecules with radically altered or even new functions capable of addressing unmet needs in
medicine, biotechnology, and synthetic biology. By transforming the traditional stepwise process of classical
directed evolution into one that operates continuously in cells, these CDE methods, such as Phage-Assisted
Continuous Evolution (PACE), can theoretically enable extensive speed, scale, and depth in an evolutionary
search. However, the technical limitations of implementing PACE (and other CDE techniques) have restricted
what can be practically achieved with these approaches alone. To overcome these limitations, our collaborative
team recently established ePACE, a new technology that combines PACE with an automated, scalable, and
customizable continuous culture platform, called eVOLVER. By on-boarding the infrastructural and fluidic
requirements of PACE onto eVOLVER, we overcame many of the limitations of traditional PACE and unlocked
pathways for automated, parallel, and continuous evolution of biomolecules. Using ePACE, we already
succeeded in generating biomedically-relevant molecules, including the multiplexed evolution of Cas9 for
precision gene editing at previously-inaccessible genomic target sites. In this project, we will advance the
capabilities of ePACE in two critical dimensions – scale and accessibility – through new hardware and fluidic
technology developments. These developments will enable novel CDE schemes necessary to tackle new
challenges in biomolecular engineering. The first challenge we will tackle is engineering systems for targeted
integration of large, gene-sized DNA payloads in mammalian cells, which would enable diverse biomedical
applications, including therapeutic treatments for virtually any loss-of-function disease. We will apply ePACE for
highly parallelized evolution of CRISPR-associated transposases (CASTs) — recently discovered, multi-
component systems that enable programmable integration of large DNA in bacteria — to generate variants with
robust mammalian genomic integration activity. To effectively explore the combinatorial space of CAST
components, we will develop an ultra-high-throughput eVOLVER variant that facilitates ePACE evolutions at
unprecedented scale and dramatically increases the number of evolutionary trajectories explored. The second
challenge is establishing generalizable methods to evolve proteins for tight and selective binding of small-
molecule ligands, which would enable diverse biomedical applications, including biosensing and detection,
metabolic engineering, and drug and toxin sequestration. As part of this goal, we will deliver on the broader
mission of democratizing CDE by developing a miniaturized, ultra-low-cost eVOLVER variant that facilitates
PACE functionality, and use it to establish general pipelines that can be easily adopted by labs with minimal
financial and technical overhead. Together, this work will substantially expand the capabilities of CDE while
producing bespoke biomolecules for unmet biomedical needs."

programing by IL-15 and RhCMV/SIV vaccine. Our goal is to define the molecular response by which IL-15 and

we term as the “whole blood protection-predictive transcriptomic signature” [wbPPTS] that predicts and underlies
vaccine protection from SIV infection. We will conduct three Aims including i) Determine the response to IL-15
in monocytes and T cells; ii) Define the tissue and cell-specific transcriptome correlates of IL-15 signaling linked
with RhCMV/SIV vaccination phenotype to program the wbPPTS, and iii) Validate RhCMV/SIV vaccination tissue

ex vivo models for analyses of cell signaling/responses to IL-15, and in vivo analyses of cell and tissue application
of three ""omics"" platforms including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq and CITEseq), bulk RNAseq, and
tissue spatial profiling. Our bioinformatics/computational analyses will integrate functional genomics data sets
with immune response and protection phenotypes to determine the molecular and cellular features directing the
wbPPTS and vaccine protection. We will conduct bioinformatics of RhCMV/SIV transcriptomic responses in an
independent vaccination/SIV challenge cohort to ascertain specific tissue signature of protection and the
wbPPTS. This work will be conducted in a collaborative framework conjunction with Cores A-C and Project 1."

The proposed study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a remotely-delivered, acceptance-based
behavioral intervention (ABTi) for individuals demonstrating weight regain after bariatric surgery by comparing
it to a Control condition. The current study aims to: 1) evaluate ABTi's efficacy on weight outcomes compared
to Control; 2) evaluate ABTi's efficacy on secondary outcomes including improvements in eating behaviors,
physical activity, and medical conditions compared to Control; 3) test proposed mechanisms of action,
including evaluating a) if changes in hypothesized active ingredients in ABTi mediate differences in weight
outcomes between conditions and b) if the association between eating behavior and subjective internal states
(i.e., hunger, cravings, urges, negative affect) will weaken in ABTi compared to Control. Patients 6 to 48
months out from surgery who have regained >5% of their weight will be randomized to ABTi or Control
(n=200). Assessments willbe conducted at baseline, 3, 6 (end of active treatment), and 12 months (follow up)
after enrollment. Developing innovative interventions to reverse postoperative weight regain is crucial to
maintain the health benefits of surgery in this growing population of patients not experiencing optimal
postoperative results."
10892269,"SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogenic coronavirus responsible for the ongoing outbreak of Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19). Although multiple approved vaccines appear efficacious, rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and
their resilience against antiviral drugs demonstrate the need to identify complementary host-targeted antiviral
approaches for current and future pandemics. Autophagy is critically involved in host defense through the
elimination of numerous pathogens via autophagic-lysosomal pathways, which serves as an intriguing drug
target. In an effort to develop novel host defense therapies for COVID-19, we observed that the protein levels of
TFEB, a master transcriptional activator of autophagy and lysosome biogenesis, rapidly declined following
human coronavirus (HCoV) infection. Utilizing affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we identified a largely
uncharacterized E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit, DCAF7, which eliminated TFEB protein through ubiquitination and
degradation. Through a structure-based in silico screen of a 3 million compound library, we discovered several
DCAF7 small molecule inhibitors, further developed a chemistry program and derived several lead compounds.
These DCAF7 inhibitors can remarkably preserve TFEB protein thus activating its target CLEAR gene network
to enhance lysosomal biogenesis and acidification. Compound treatment notably reduced viral load in both HCoV
challenged cells and SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. With the observations that small
molecules inhibiting DCAF7 can strengthen the host's lysosomal-based viral clearance, we hypothesize
that cellular levels of TFEB are exquisitely controlled by DCAF7 to maintain lysosomal homeostasis and
host defense responses. As a corollary to this hypothesis, we propose that DCAF7 small molecule
inhibition will attenuate COVID-19 by preserving TFEB protein levels and boosting lysosomal-dependent
pathogen clearance in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this proposal, we will examine the interactive
regulation between DCAF7/TFEB and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to identify the mechanism of how DCAF7
inhibitors impact the viral life cycle (Aim 1). Further, we propose to initiate a robust drug discovery program and
further advance unique small molecule DCAF7 inhibitors that empower lysosome (Aim 2). Finally, we will test
the efficacy of these inhibitors to decrease lung viral load in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-
CoV-2 variants of concern (Aim 3). The significance of this work stems from our discovery of a new molecular
model for COVID-19 using a unique small molecule inhibiting the CRL4-DCAF7 ubiquitin E3 ligase that can boost
the host's antiviral response by activating lysosomes. Our proposal combines innovative concepts and drug
discovery technology with cutting-edge COVID-19 animal models to develop novel therapeutic compounds
targeting conserved host pathways critical for defense against coronavirus infection. We anticipate that DCAF7
inhibitors could be used prophylactically or therapeutically against coronaviruses ranging from the common cold
to SARS-CoV-2. They can also serve as an off-the-shelf therapy for the next novel coronavirus pandemic."
10915607,"Abstract. Consuming a nutrient-dense diet, rich in fruits and vegetables (F&Vs) is at the cornerstone of type 2
diabetes (T2DM) treatment. Yet, among Hispanic adults, only 16% meet the recommended minimum F&V
intake recommendations and they have higher rates of T2DM than non-Hispanic whites (16.6% versus 13.3%,
respectively). F&V Prescription (F&V Rx) programs are embedded in clinical settings, target medically high-risk
patients such as those with T2DM, and provide them with vouchers to purchase F&V at local retailers.
Preliminary F&V Rx studies in patients with T2DM have found F&V intake increases of 0.2-1.6 servings per
day and hemoglobin A1c (A1c) reductions from 0.35-0.71% [3.8 -7.8 mmol/mol]. However, none of these
studies included diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) which can lead to A1c decreases
from 0.24% to 1.0% [2.6-10.9 mmol/mol]. Our team conducted a pilot F&V Rx study where we incentivized
DSME/S attendance by providing a F&V Rx at each session. Although DSME/S uptake is typically very low
after referral (around 5-7%), our program had a 73% first session attendance rate. Further, at 7 months post-
program, we found a clinically- and statistically-significant reduction in A1c of 1.3% [14.2 mmol/mol] (p=.001).
Although the receipt of the F&V Rx vouchers was contingent upon DSME/S attendance in our study, other
T2DM-focused F&V Rx studies did not have DSME/S attendance requirements and they also saw A1c
reductions. Thus, understanding the effect of a F&V Rx on DSME/S uptake and retention with and without
attendance requirements is a key design issue that must be evaluated. This proposal is in response to PAS 20-
160 for short-term, pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to acquire preliminary data regarding trial design.
We propose a 3-Arm, 16-week, pilot RCT (n=120) for low-income adults (aged 18+) with T2DM (A1c >7% [53
mmol/mol]). The control group (n=40) will receive usual care (UC). The two intervention groups (n=40 each)
will receive UC plus a F&V Rx that is either independent of DSME/S attendance (F&V Rx alone) or dependent
on DSME/S attendance (F&V Rx + DSME/S). First, we will systematically explore the impact of a F&V Rx on
uptake and retention in DSME/S. Next, we will explore changes in A1c, and diet-related outcomes. Finally, with
implementation in mind, we will use Proctor’s implementation taxonomy, and the cultural adaptation framework
from Castro et al., to assess program appropriateness, acceptability, and sustainability with both participants
and clinical care providers. Our study team and our Community Advisory Board (CAB) have the research,
clinical expertise, and established retail network necessary to conduct a F&V Rx trial in a low-income, Hispanic
community. The findings of this trial will inform the design of a future, fully powered RCT and address gaps in
our knowledge related to how F&V Rx programs impact T2DM-related outcomes. If effective, F&V Rx
programs have the potential to improve diabetes self-management and reduce the clinical burden of poor
glycemic control, particularly in low-income, Hispanic communities."
10881982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Achieving noninvasive, cell-type-specific, and spatially precise neuromodulation remains to be a major
challenge in the development of neuromodulation technologies. The objective of this project is to develop
Sonogenetics 2.0, the next-generation sonogenetic technique for cell-type-specific, spatially precise
neuromodulation in the whole brain of freely behaving animals without intracranial surgery. Sonogenetics 2.0
employs low-intensity focused ultrasound (FUS) combined with microbubbles to deliver intranasally administered
adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to the FUS-targeted brain region with minimal systemic exposure. It then
utilizes FUS sonication to remotely activate the expressed ultrasound-sensitive ion channels encoded by the
AAVs and thereby controls the activity of AAV-transduced neurons. Sonogenetics 2.0 addresses three critical
barriers to developing sonogenetics: the lacks molecular probes with optimized ultrasound sensitivity (Aim 1),
requires surgical injection of viral vectors to express the probes (Aim 2), and has a low spatial resolution in
delivering ultrasound in the mouse brain (Aim 3). Sonogenetics 2.0 will be independently validated by
neuroscience laboratories and benchmarked with optogenetics (Aim 4). The proposed Sonogenetics 2.0 is
significant because technological breakthroughs are urgently needed to fulfill the great potential of
sonogenetics. Sonogenetics 2.0 provides a complementary tool to existing neuromodulation techniques with the
potential to be translated to large animals and humans. A multidisciplinary team with combined expertise in
ultrasound device design, ion channel engineering, neuromodulation, and neuroscience is well suited to this
project. This project is innovative because Sonogenetics 2.0 is the first-in-class ultrasound tool for completely
noninvasive and cell-type-specific neuromodulation by combining noninvasive genetic construct delivery with
noninvasive activation of transduced neurons. The proposed research is expected to have a sustained, powerful
impact in the research field of sonogenetics and provide the neuroscience community with a transformative tool
that can be widely used to advance our current capabilities in investigating cell-type-specific processes in intact
mammalian brains."
10918249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need to develop and implement more efficient approaches to evaluate
cardiovascular devices in representative patient populations. Data from registries, health care systems,
and payers, often include detailed clinical baseline information and longitudinal outcomes on a large number of
patients representative of those cared for in clinical practice. However, the most commonly performed non-
randomized evaluations using these data have high risk of bias due to a number of methodological challenges,
including unmeasured differences between patients receiving different treatments (confounding) and
misalignment of treatment eligibility, treatment initiation and beginning of follow up (selection bias). Thus, there
is great enthusiasm for exploiting newer study design and analysis strategies that can more closely
approximate the results of a desired but yet-to-be-performed randomized trial, while gaining the efficiency and
representativeness of using data routinely collected in the course of patient care. Applying state-of-the-science
methods to diverse and rich datasets may identify specific populations with different responses to device
treatment - a key step in the ability to deliver individualized patient-centered care. In this renewal application,
we will continue to pursue the overarching goal of developing innovative approaches to enhance the
efficiency, fidelity and generalizability of cardiovascular device evaluation through the analysis of
unique multidimensional linked datasets. In Aim 1, we will apply new methods to transport inferences about
treatment effects from pivotal randomized trials of high-risk cardiovascular devices to new target populations
representative of patients seen in contemporary practice. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the safety and
effectiveness of high-risk cardiovascular devices through application of the target trial framework, a set of
conceptual and practical tools for designing observational emulations of randomized trials that is well suited to
overcome common forms of selection bias (e.g., immortal time bias) in cardiovascular device comparisons. In
Aim 3, we will apply quasi-experimental methods to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of these devices,
including instrumental variable and instrumented difference-in-difference designs. In each of the three aims, we
will develop and apply methods to examine subgroups of patients under-represented in trials, specifically
women, Black patients, and patients from socially disadvantaged communities. This research will inform the
safety and effectiveness of several cardiovascular devices that have not been well studied, provide important
clinical information to practicing physicians in the community, and create new standards for the future
regulatory evaluation of medical devices using transportability, observational, and quasi-experimental
approaches to complement standard randomized trials."

The current renewal proposal seeks to expand upon our successful initial award to clarify the mechanisms
underlying observed associations between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and suicidal behaviors (SB), including
non-fatal suicide attempts and suicide death. The research team has an extensive history of productive
collaborations, including in the realm of psychiatric and substance use disorder research. We have access to
longitudinal Swedish national registries including medical, criminal, census, family, and socioeconomic data for
nearly 11 million individuals; these resources will be linked to create detailed datasets encompassing a wide
range of risk factors at individual, familial, and environmental levels. We will utilize these resources to extend
our prior research through the pursuit of four specific aims. In the first aim we will evaluate how AUD and post-
traumatic stress disorder, or trauma exposure, relate via mediating or moderating pathways to risk of SB. We
will apply well-established methods, including those that facilitate causal inference. Second, we will directly
compare and contrast pathways to SB via AUD versus major depression (MD). AUD and MD constitute two
primary correlates/risk factors for SB, but much remains unknown about distinctions and commonalities between
these associations. The current proposal will focus primarily on the role of social dysfunction, with the goal of
identifying factors that may improve risk assessment. Third, we will consider how AUD relates to two common
medical conditions, cardiovascular disease and dementia, with respect to SB risk. Both conditions are
themselves associated with increased SB risk but whether they mediate and/or exacerbate the impact of AUD
is not known. Finally, we will leverage our expertise in genetic epidemiology by pursuing analyses that will clarify
how aggregate genetic liability to AUD or SB, versus AUD and SB, is differentially related to psychopathology
and other correlates of risk. Critically, Sweden and the US have comparable rates of suicidal behavior and share
many characteristics, including an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population; however, the US lacks
registry resources comparable to those available in Sweden. We expect that the statistical power of these
registries, in conjunction with the research team’s extensive expertise in psychiatric and substance abuse
research, social and genetic epidemiology, and causal modeling, will yield substantive findings on the
relationship between AUD and SB, with important implications for improving our efforts at SB prevention and
intervention."
10908724,"Abstract
The main goal of my laboratory is to understand the neural circuits that support perceptual decision-making.
Recent efforts to understand microcircuits within decision-making areas have been fruitful, thanks in part to the
ability to identify and manipulate distinct types of inhibitory neurons. Our understanding how distinct types of
excitatory pyramidal neurons (PyNs) shape circuits has lagged behind. This lack of understanding is particularly
problematic for decision circuits in which PyN type can determine the long-range project target of neurons within
an area. To surmount this problem, we propose to compare the contribution of distinct PyN types to key decision-
making computations: working memory and evidence accumulation. We will measure and manipulate neural
activity of intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in animals trained to make decisions about
the stochastically-varying spatial position of visual gratings. We seek to understand how PT and IT neurons in
multiple neural structures collectively support the computations needed for decision-making. In Aim 1, we will
use widefield calcium imaging to generate cortex-wide activity maps for each PyN type. We will compare the
spatial and temporal patterns at multiple scales, and will deploy quantitative analyses to identify candidate
regions for decision-making computations. In Aim 2, we will measure the activity of single cells within these
regions using 2-photon imaging. We will use a generalized linear model (GLM) to estimate the extent to which
single neurons are modulated by relevant variables, such as stimulus events, choice, and movements. We will
compare these across PT and IT neurons. The same models will estimate the magnitude and time course of
“coupling” between neurons, which we will compare across PyN types and regions. Shorter coupling time
courses are expected for neurons that support sensory encoding, while longer coupling time courses are
expected for neurons that support working memory. We will use these observations to generate a new,
biologically realistic model that includes PyN types in multiple areas working together to support decision-making
computations. In Aim 3, we will evaluate a causal role for PyN types using cell-type specific optogenetic
inactivation. We will compare multiple aspects of decision-making behavior on trials with vs. without inactivation.
For example, we will determine how inactivation affects decision accuracy, and the extent to which this depends
on when inactivation occurs. We will also determine how inactivation impacts the animal’s ability to accumulate
sensory evidence and/or drives movements that can be detected with a classifier trained on video data. We will
use this data to “stress test” the model, evaluating whether inactivations in our artificial network generate the
same changes as inactivations in the real brain. If not, we will update and re-test the model, creating a tight loop
between experiments and modeling. Taken together, the proposed work will advance our understanding of
decision-making beyond the non-specific approach that has limited a mechanistic understanding thus far."

Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) experience severe and persistent difficulties with impulsivity, especially
when experiencing strong emotions. Emotion-based impulsivity is associated with increased
hospitalizations, lost relationships, substance use, and suicide. Yet, mechanisms underlying emotion-based
impulsivity are not well understood, limiting the design of effective interventions. To this end, the Candidate
aims to use multimodal assessments to identify candidate mechanisms of emotion-based impulsivity in the lab
and daily life. This K23 proposal has two goals: 1) to delineate neurophysiological indicators of cognitive
control using electroencephalogram (EEG) and their association with real-world emotion-based impulsivity in
daily life measured with ecological momentary assessment (EMA); and 2) To provide the Candidate with
training in affective neuroscience and experimental psychopathology (training objective 1), EEG
methods and analysis (training objective 2), and intensive longitudinal modeling (training objective 3),
to accelerate clinical translational research (training objective 4) in BD. The proposed project will study 90
adults across the entire bipolar spectrum (30 healthy controls, 30 subclinical BD, and 30 diagnosed BD) drawn
from the well-established Prechter Longitudinal Cohort (
n = 1,394)
at the University of Michigan. Participants
will complete trait measures of emotion-based impulsivity, an affective inhibition paradigm while undergoing an
EEG, and a 28-day EMA protocol developed to assess momentary affective arousal, emotion regulation, and
impulsivity. The research specific aims are to: 1) Identify neurophysiological components of cognitive control
that
are associated with
trait and lab-based emotion-based impulsivity, and 2) Evaluate the extent to which
these components
are associated with
emotion-based impulsivity in real-world settings. This proposed
research is innovative in examining neural oscillations and synchrony embedded in EEG signals as a
mechanism of emotion-based impulsivity and linking it with real-world behavior using ecological momentary
assessment. It has significant implications because it could yield novel neural and cognitive treatment targets
(e.g., neuromodulation of theta-band activity as an adjunct to psychosocial interventions) to improve emotion-
based impulsivity in BD after further mechanistic studies. The Candidate is supported by a team of mentors
and consultants who are leading experts in translational clinical science and areas of proposed training: Dr. Ivy
Tso (Primary Mentor, EEG methods and analysis), Dr. Melvin McInnis (Co-Mentor, bipolar disorder,
responsible conduct of research), Dr. David Fresco (Consultant: affective neuroscience, emotion regulation),
Dr. Daniel McNeish (Statistical Consultant: intensive longitudinal modeling),
Dr. Flavio Frohlich (Consultant:
EEG time frequency analysis)
and Dr. Sheri Johnson (Consultant: emotion-based impulsivity). This career
development award is critical for advancing the Candidate’s independent program of research and long-term
goal to identify and refine targets for personalized interventions in BD."
10914247,"Project summary: This K08 proposal describes a 5-year research and training plan that will facilitate the
transition of Chintan Gandhi, MD to an independent researcher in the field of lung innate immunity and host
defense. Dr. Gandhi is establishing himself as a basic and translational researcher focusing on innate immune
responses to respiratory infections with a focus on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Although RSV is the
leading cause of mortality due to viral respiratory illnesses in children worldwide, there are no virus-specific
treatments or vaccines currently available. This is partly due to an incomplete understanding of the interaction
between the virus and the immature host immune system. Age at initial infection and male sex are independent
risk factors for RSV severity. Surfactant protein A (SP-A), an innate immune protein, regulates phagocytic and
inflammatory functions of alveolar macrophages (AMs) through the surfactant protein-A-receptor 210 (SP-
R210). SP-A genetic variants and low levels of SP-A are associated with RSV severity. Dr. Gandhi reported
associations of young age and the 1A0 variant of SFTPA2 (SFTPA2-1A0) with RSV severity in children. The
focus of this proposal is to investigate the underlying mechanisms of those associations using a humanized
transgenic neonatal mouse model of RSV carrying the SFTPA2-1A0 variant. The central hypothesis is that SP-
A genetic variants and male sex converge to dysregulate the SP-A/SP-R210 pathway in neonatal AMs leading
to delayed RSV clearance and excessive inflammation. The central hypothesis will be tested via the following
Specific Aims: 1) determine how SFTPA2-1A0 regulates in vivo AM differential responses to RSV in male and
female pups, and 2) elucidate mechanisms of the SFTPA2-1A0 mediated dysfunction of SP-A/SP-R210
pathway in RSV clearance and define in vivo therapeutic effects of exogenous SP-A in neonatal RSV infection.
These studies will yield important information about the SP-A/SP-R210 signaling as a novel pathway in RSV
severity and will also determine if SP-A, its receptor, SP-R210, or the modulation of the SP-A/SP-R210
pathway may be future therapeutic targets for RSV infection. During the award period, Dr. Gandhi will continue
to develop his expertise in immunology, molecular biology, and genetics. In addition, Dr. Gandhi will develop
skills in flow cytometry and microscopic approaches to study viral dynamics. A multidisciplinary mentorship
team has been assembled to ensure the success of this project, and includes expertise in virus biology,
pathogenesis, and development of novel antiviral agents (Dr. Lukacher); lung cell purification, culture
protocols, and advanced life imaging techniques (Dr. Chroneos); and mechanisms of sex differences in
neonatal pulmonary diseases (Dr. Lingappan). The mentorship team will guide Dr. Gandhi in meeting his
training objectives through direct research experience, formal didactics, and participation in career
development opportunities. The research described in this proposal is innovative and will be a substantive
addition to the knowledge gap and will help Dr. Gandhi to become an independent R01-funded investigator."

the role of the gut microbiome in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its mouse model experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). Since joining Mount Sinai as a tenure track faculty, she has been conducting several
studies to investigate the effect of vancomycin on neuroinflammation in EAE mice. Studies from her laboratory
revealed that vancomycin is a potent modulator of the gut-brain axis and they also identified 50 gut commensals

collaborations, and learn of recent advances in the field. Dr. Tankou’s research utilizes cutting-edge approaches
to advance understanding of the role of the gut microbiota on astrocyte barrier function. She proposes to identify
communities of gut microbes and their metabolites that regulate astrocyte barrier function and their impact on
central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Dr. Tankou preliminary data have demonstrated that butyrate-
producing bacteria as well as butyrate modulate astrocyte barrier function via induction of astrocytic claudin-4.
In the first specific aim, experiments will be conducted to identify human gut derived bacteria and gut microbiota
derived metabolites that modulate astrocytic CLDN4 expression. The second aim will examine the effect of
butyrate on (1) astrocytic CLDN4 expression, (2) immune cell trafficking across the glia limitans and (3) CNS
inflammation in EAE mice. The Icahn School of Medicine has demonstrated commitment to Dr. Tankou’s career
with a 75% protected faculty position to conduct research. She hopes to develop innovative microbiome-based
approaches to target neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in MS."
10909304,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Therapeutic management of lung disorders triggered by the loss-of-function of the cystic fibrosis (CF)
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function in response to leading to CF are challenged by genetic
and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. The highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) Trikafta has
a pronounced but incomplete and variable impact on the pathology of disease in the clinic. We now need to
discover new approaches to further improve clinical outcome. CF is not a simple monogenic disease but rather
a complex disease impacted by membrane trafficking and channel function of CFTR- as well as diverse clinical
features including inflammation, mucociliary clearance, and bacterial infection. These environmental features of
disease lead to lung dysfunction as well as multi-organ symptoms including pancreatic and intestinal dysfunction.
New approaches that capture the link between the genotype and cellular dysfunctional phenotypes as a
collective of covariant events in the individual will require a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles
dictating disease influenced by genetic and epigenetic diversity of the population. This proposal is about
understanding the role of the epigenetic environment in management of CF in response to the histone
deacetylase (HDAC) program controlling gene expression during development, aging and in response to cellular
stress in disease. During the previous funding period, we have shown that the collective of variation found in the
CF population can be used to define sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships responsive to HDAC
inhibitors (HDACi). We will study the interlinked roles of genetic and epigenetic diversity using novel machine
learning computational approaches we developed during the previous funding period that can be integrated with
experimental/clinical features to discover therapeutics that could considerably improve patient well-being in
response to the HEMT Trikafta. To understand the impact of complex epigenetic pathways in CF to improve
Trikafta performance, we will apply our new Gaussian process (GP) based platform, referred to as variation
spatial profiling (VSP) based variation capture (VarC) mapping, to profile at a residue-residue basis at atomic
resolution a map of hidden spatial covariant (SCV) interactions that can resolve complex phenotypic relationships
in response to genetic/epigenetic diversity. During the previous funding period, VSP/VarC mapping revealed a
hidden ‘YKDAD’ energetic core in the CFTR fold that is the foundational basis for disease in the majority of the
CF population that is not corrected by the HEMT Trikafta- limiting its impact in the clinic. In Aim 1 we will use
VSP/VarC mapping to inform us of the complex disease states disrupted by CFTR misfolding, trafficking and
function affecting inflammation, mucociliary clearance and infection to predict how to more effectively treat the
patient through use of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi). In Aim 2, we will specifically explore the role of HDAC7, which
we have previously shown to correct CFTR function. We hypothesize that knowledge of the role of the HDAC
epigenetic program can be used to enhance HEMT efficacy in the path to a cure."

Aging is multifaceted while many hormonal and metabolic regulators are crucial, pointing to the extremely
strong significance of endocrine and metabolic processes in aging physiology and intervention. The
hypothalamus is the “headquarters” for regulating systemic endocrine systems and metabolic physiology as
well as the autonomic nervous system for physiological homeostasis. In the past, the lab of the PI has
developed a major research area of studying the significance of hypothalamus in aging, including formulation of
the “hypothalamic control of aging” paradigm which subsequently led to the generation of anti-aging model by
hypothalamic stem/progenitor cells. The long-term objective of this research is to study the underlying
hypothalamic anti-aging basis and therefore to develop novel and effective targets for counteracting against
aging-related neurodegeneration and disease. In preliminary studies of this project, it was found that
hypothalamic extracellular vesicles (EVs) are strongly anti-aging and anti-neurodegenerative in multiple
experimental models. Also, parathymosin in these EVs was found crucial for the anti-neurodegenerative
actions in recipient neurons. Thus, this project is proposed based on the hypothesis that hypothalamic EVs are
important for brain transfer and neuroprotective while restoring these EVs has a significant interventional value
against aging-related neurodegeneration and disorders. Three specific aims are: (1) study hypothalamic and
brain transfer of hypothalamic EVs and aging relevance; (2) study the neuroprotective and anti-
neurodegenerative actions of parathymosin-containing hypothalamic EVs and the underlying basis; (3) study
the significance of hypothalamic EVs for treating neurodegenerative disorders and improving aging physiology
and healthspan. Experiments in these Aims will be carried out by using mouse models of hypothalamic
regional and cell-specific manipulations of EVs as well as models of pharmacological intervention with
hypothalamic EVs. A list of molecular, cellular and physiological methods will be used to analyze hypothalamic
EVs in terms of biochemical profile of brain distribution and uptake, the cellular effects for neuroprotection in
recipient neurons, and anti-aging physiological and therapeutic effects in relevant aging models. Overall,
successful completion of this project will lead to new important knowledge about the hypothalamic basis of
aging and novel strategy for managing healthy aging and alleviating aging-related disorders and diseases."
11175147,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
The heterotrimeric G proteins transduce signals from the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest class
of cell surface proteins that regulate a wide variety of biological processes. Gα13, a member of the G12 family
of heterotrimeric G proteins, has been reported to be a tumor suppressor or promoter in different tumor contexts.
We recently reported that loss of Gα13 accelerated tumor development and reduced survival in a well-
characterized genetic mouse model of pancreatic cancer. Mechanistically, Gα13-deficient mouse pancreatic
tumors had elevated mTOR signaling, similar to human pancreatic cancer. Consistently, tumors derived from
Gα13-deficient pancreatic cancer cells were susceptible to rapamycin, a well-characterized mTOR inhibitor.
Recently, we have shown that loss of Gα13 in pancreatic tumors and cancer cells increased mitochondrial
metabolism and expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the impact of tumor metabolism and
inflammation on the development and progression of Gα13-deficient tumors and whether mTOR signaling
regulates these processes has not been investigated. Our objective in this application is to elucidate the
mechanism(s) by which the deletion of Gα13 in the pancreas cancer cells contributes to tumor development and
progression in vivo. The central hypothesis is that loss of Gα13 promotes tumor development through elevated
mTOR signaling to drive mitochondrial metabolism and inflammation. Two specific aims are proposed: 1)
Determine whether mTORC1 signaling is necessary for promoting cellular metabolism of Gα13-deficient pancreas
tumors. 2) Determine whether mTORC1 signaling is essential in mediating the increased inflammation in Gα13-
deficient tumors. In Aim 1, we will determine whether inhibition of mTORC1 signaling delays tumor development
and induces cell death in early and advanced tumors lacking Gα13. Further, we will assess how Gα13 loss
regulates tumor metabolism and whether Gα13-deficient tumors are susceptible to perturbations of mitochondrial
functions. In Aim 2, we will determine whether Gα13 loss increases inflammatory cytokine levels and tumor-
promoting immune cells in early and advanced tumors. We will determine whether blocking mTORC1 signaling
limits the expression of candidate cytokines and immune cell infiltration to suppress tumor growth in Gα13 lacking
tumors. Finally, we will examine whether combining anti-inflammatory agents with inhibitors of mitochondrial
function will synergistically enhance anti-tumor efficacy. The innovative component of this proposal is the use of
a unique mouse model to study the tumor suppressive function of Gα13, where the loss of the gene in both
human and mouse pancreas tumors correlates with elevated mTOR signaling and worse survival outcome. We
will also use the innovative approach of human tumor slice culture assays to determine whether Gα13 status
dictates the response to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling. The proposal is significant because it will elucidate the
tumor suppressive mechanisms of Gα13 in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into beneficial therapies for
patients with Gα13 deficiency."
10909321,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer genomic studies have identified a large number of mutations, including point mutations,
insertions/deletions (indels), and structural variants in coding and regulatory regions. For many
uncharacterized mutations, how they contribute to tumor growth and resistance to therapy remains murky. In
vivo functional validation is a pre-requisite for identifying suitable interventions and biomarkers. Rapid and
flexible genome editing platforms are therefore needed to build and validate precision mouse models with
translational value.
Recent advances in CRISPR-based genome editing allow us to directly model cancer mutations in adult
mouse tissues, bypassing the need for germline mouse models. Current CRISPR-based approaches however
are either inefficient (e.g., homology directed repair) or cannot be used to model all types of mutations (e.g.,
base editing). A more flexible genome editing platform is needed to speed up the generation of somatic cancer
mouse models.
We have begun to optimize prime editing as a way to precisely model a wide variety of cancer mutations in
mice. Prime editor (PE)—Cas9 nickase fused to reverse transcriptase—utilizes an extended guide RNA (called
a pegRNA) that doubles as a template for reverse transcriptase to copy information into the genomic target.
We have recently developed an optimized PE that can install cancer mutations in mouse liver. We also
engineered a dual-PE approach to precisely introduce large deletions (up to ~10 kb) with short insertions. This
work provides a foundation upon which to further optimize the delivery of PE to mice and to expand its
application to cancer mouse models.
The goal of this project is to develop and optimize new PE tools to speed up the generation of both
constitutive and inducible somatic mouse models of liver and lung cancer. Aim 1 will define rules for optimal
pegRNA design while validating 100 cancer-associated mutations, establish platforms for somatic cancer
modeling in vivo, define pre-clinical features of PE models, and develop delivery vectors for multiplexed prime
editing in mouse lung. Aim 2 will develop prime editing tools for inducible cancer models. Dual-PE approaches
will be used to make inducible alleles and floxed alleles in mouse liver. We will also generate efficient PE
models to recapitulate large genomic deletions in human cancer. This project will result in new mouse models
that validate driver mutations in liver and lung cancer and will provide a flexible platform to enhance the
translational utility of mouse models of cancer."

Dementia is a major cause of death and disability and has emerged as one of the major public health issues of
today. Hypertension is a leading risk factor for dementia, both Alzheimer disease (AD) but also Alzheimer disease
related dementias (ADRD). Hypertension disrupts the function of the neurovascular unit and promotes vascular
insufficiency, leading to neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment. Salt-sensitivity is a critical factor in
essential hypertension, affecting approximately 50% of hypertensive individuals, but it is unknown how it leads
to cognitive impairment. Dietary salt activates signaling pathways which promote production of interleukin-17
(IL17), and increasing circulating levels of the cytokine IL17 have been identified in patients with hypertension,
raising the possibility that this cytokine may be involved. Here we will test the hypothesis that the harmful effects
of salt-sensitive HTN are mediated by IL17 acting on IL17 receptors on both endothelial cells and perivascular
macrophages (PVM), free radical-producing immune cells located in the perivascular space closely apposed to
cerebral microvessels, via two distinct mechanisms: (1) circulating IL17 acts on endothelial cells to induce a loss
of the beneficial effects of nitric oxide (NO), while (2) T-cells infiltrating the meninges increase IL17 in the
cerebrospinal fluid which acts on PVM to induce oxidative stress and proinflammatory signaling. Together, these
actions lead to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment in salt-sensitive HTN. To this end, we will
first establish the temporal relationship between neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction in a mouse model of
salt-sensitive hypertension. Then, we will use pharmacological and cell-specific genetic approaches to determine
the contribution of IL17 to the neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction in this model, and establish what are the
cellular targets of IL17 in the neurovascular unit. Finally, we will determine the role of peripheral versus central
T-cells in mediating the dysfunction, focusing on the relative contribution of meningeal IL17gdT-cells. To achieve
these goals, we will use state-of-the-art approaches to study neurovascular regulation, including genetic models
for specific conditional knockdown of the IL17 receptor subunit A. In addition to providing me with a unique
training opportunity, these studies will fill an obvious gap in the understanding of the mechanisms by which HTN
and excessive dietary salt lead to cognitive impairment and may provide new therapeutic approaches to mitigate
the damaging effects of HTN on cognitive health."
10915043,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CARTx) has transformed treatment for B cell malignancies. However,
the effects of CARTx on humoral immunity and infection risk are incompletely understood. The high prevalence
of hypogammaglobulinemia in CARTx recipients has driven frequent use of prophylactic immunoglobulin G (IgG)
replacement therapy (IGRT) to prevent infections in this patient population. However, limited data exist to support
this practice, and shortages, side effects, and cost necessitate careful stewardship of IGRT. Emerging data
indicate that pathogen-specific antibodies often persist after CD19-CARTx, potentially contesting the need for
IGRT. Well controlled studies are needed to ascertain the clinical utility of IGRT in CARTx recipients. Within this
clinical context, other important and connected questions remain about how IGRT affects CAR-T cell function,
in addition to the possible costs versus benefits of the effect of IGRT on healthcare resource utilization.
This timely and unique proposal will be the first randomized, controlled trial of IGRT use in CARTx recipients and
provide critical insights into the potential risks and benefits of IGRT in this patient population. The key objectives
of this study are to evaluate whether IGRT in CARTx recipients reduces infection rates compared to placebo,
and to understand the impact of IGRT on previously unexplored outcomes such as CAR-T cell expansion, CAR-
T cell persistence, CAR-T cell function, and healthcare resource utilization. For the proposed study, we have
assembled an interdisciplinary group of physicians and scientists from high-volume CARTx centers who will
leverage our expertise in immuno-oncology, infectious diseases, and cancer outcomes research.
We propose a randomized trial of IGRT versus placebo in 150 adults with serum total IgG ≤400 mg/dL prior to
CD19-CARTx. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive IGRT or placebo within 14 days prior to CARTx
and at 28-day intervals after CARTx for 4 months. Aim 1 will compare between study arms the incidence rate of
infections through 6 months after CD19-CARTx; we will also longitudinally characterize and compare total and
pathogen-specific IgG levels and their association with infections. Aim 2 will explore the association of IGRT with
healthcare resource utilization, cytokine release syndrome, and CARTx-associated neurotoxicity. Aim 3 will
characterize the impact of IGRT on CAR-T cell expansion, persistence, and function.
This will be the first randomized controlled study of IGRT after CARTx and will provide foundational data to
establish evidence-based estimates of the clinical efficacy and risk-benefit of IGRT in CD19-CARTx recipients.
In parallel, this study will explore other potential effects of IGRT on CAR-T cell dynamics and healthcare resource
utilization. The data generated by this proposal will provide the groundwork for future studies to refine infection
prevention strategies in the growing population of CARTx recipients."
10913584,"Project Summary: Oncolytic virotherapy (OV) represents a novel method to treat a variety of solid tumors by
inducing anti-tumor immune responses. While this therapy has been extremely efficacious in a wide variety of
preclinical models, translating these successes into human patients has proven challenging. It has recently
become clear that one of the major reasons for these failures is the existence of immune-regulatory
mechanisms which dampen the efficacy of virally induced anti-tumor immunity. However, the exact nature of
these regulatory pathways remains unclear.
 Our lab has previously developed a novel oncolytic MYXV which expresses a soluble PD1 inhibitor and an
IL12 fusion protein (vPD1/IL12). This construct is highly effective at treating disseminated disease, however,
~50% of tumor models remain at least partially non-responsive and viral treatment is associated with the
development of immune-related adverse events. In our follow-up studies into the mechanisms mediating the
efficacy of vPD1/IL12 we have observed that the virus induces high levels of TNF during therapy. Strikingly,
both genetic elimination or antibody-based blockade of this TNF results in a significant INCREASE in
therapeutic efficacy as well as a significant REDUCTION in toxicity. To our knowledge, no other studies have
demonstrated a positive impact of TNF blockade on OV and therefore both the mechanism(s) involved as well
as how to leverage this finding into improved clinical outcomes remains unclear. We therefore put forth the
current proposal which contains three specific aims designed to build off of our exciting preliminary data by:
identifying the mechanism through which TNF restricts OV efficacy, understanding how TNF mediates OV-
induced toxicities, and determining clinically applicable methods to apply TNF-blockade during OV. This work
will advance not only the clinical use of our existing vPD1/IL12 virus, but also improve our understanding of the
basic mechanisms involved in successful OV."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-DK-22-502, “Limited Competition: Continuation
of the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study (U01)” on behalf of the University of
Pennsylvania (Penn) Clinical Center. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 37 million
Americans who are at risk of progression to end stage kidney disease and development of
cardiovascular disease (CV) and other comorbidities associated with disability, high costs of
care and premature mortality. Since its inception in 2001, the CRIC Study has recruited and
followed a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of 5,625 participants with reduced kidney
function from 13 recruitment sites at 7 Clinical Centers across the US. The Penn site has
contributed significantly to CRIC and recruited 723 or 12.8 % of the participants. The original
aim of CRIC was to establish a clinical research laboratory designed to (a) identify novel
predictors of CKD progression, and (b) characterize the manifestations of CV disease and
identify its risk factors among individuals with CKD. As the landmark prospective cohort study of
CKD, the CRIC Study has accomplished extensive biological, physiological, and social
phenotyping, longitudinal follow-up, and ascertainment of clinical and patient-centered
outcomes across multiple domains. Findings from the CRIC Study have defined trajectories of
CKD progression, catalogued development and evolution of comorbidities in CKD, and identified
a diverse array of factors and pathways that explain the progression and complications of CKD
in adults. Through its highly productive Ancillary Studies and Opportunity Pool Programs, both
the scientific scope of the CRIC Study and the community of kidney disease researchers have
been markedly expanded. During the most recent funding cycle (Phase 4: 2018-2023), three
innovative sub-protocol studies were implemented to enrich CRIC data with home-based
assessments of kidney function and CV measures. During the fifth and final phase of the CRIC
Study, the major focus will be to (1) ascertain the clinical outcomes for all participants including
those enrolled in the Phase 4 sub-protocols, (2) perform analyses linking the sub-protocol
measurements to clinical outcomes, (3) integrate data from multiple domains to identify sub-
phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity in CKD progression outcomes, (4) conduct final study
visits for the full CRIC cohort eligible for Phase 5, (5) create mechanisms for future data
collection via linkages with external sources of health data, and (6) generate tools and
resources to facilitate ongoing use of CRIC data and biospecimens by a broad group of
investigators after the CRIC Study has officially ended."

Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is essential for tissue patterning and cell proliferation in development, regeneration,
and disease. As classical morphogens, Hh ligands direct cell fate decisions in a manner dependent on
signaling strength. Precise regulation of signaling strength is critical for proper tissue development and
maintenance, highlighted by the fact that even modest changes in the signaling amplitude can result in human
birth defects. While a large body of work has shown that signaling strength is influenced by the concentration
and exposure time of Hh ligands, an equally important layer of regulation remains unrecognized and unstudied:
How is the sensitivity of target cells to morphogens regulated? During the first phase of my postdoctoral
training, I used genome-wide CRISPR screens to discover three genes that function to attenuate Hh signaling
in target cells: Mosmo, Megf8, and Mgrn1 (the “MMM module”). Disruption of the MMM module in both
fibroblasts and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) resulted in a ~10-fold increase in sensitivity to Hh ligands and
altered neural cell-fate decisions, driven by a marked increase in levels of the transmembrane transducer
Smoothened (SMO) at primary cilia. These studies lead to the hypothesis that the MMM module regulates
signaling strength in target cells by regulating the sub-cellular localization of Hh pathway components. To test
this hypothesis, I will (1) determine the mechanism by which the MMM module regulates SMO trafficking, (2)
illuminate the role of ubiquitination in MMM-regulated SMO trafficking and Hh sensitivity, and (3) identify the
function of the MMM module during embryonic development. These studies will unravel the molecular basis
and physiological function of a novel mechanism that allows target cells to modify their responses to
extracellular cues and consequently suggest new strategies to modulate Hh signaling strength in disease
states. In graduate school, I trained as a mouse geneticist and embryologist. During the first phase of my
postdoc, I learned how to use CRISPR technology to conduct genome-wide loss-of-function screens and to
test the function of specific genes in sophisticated in vitro differentiation assays. Support from the K99
program, the resources available at Stanford University, and the expertise of my advisory panel will allow me to
develop critical new skills in the areas of advanced microscopy, protein biochemistry, and mass spectrometry
to understand the biochemical and biological function of developmental regulators like the MMM module. I will
accomplish this with training from my mentor Dr. Rajat Rohatgi (biochemistry and cancer biology), my co-
mentor Dr. Tim Stearns (cilia biology), and a strong advisory panel composed of members with expertise in
protein trafficking, computational biology, developmental biology, and mass spectrometry. The training and
mentorship I receive during my K99/R00 award will provide a critical stepping stone for me to achieve my
academic goal of establishing a vibrant independent research program that can answer important questions in
developmental signaling using approaches ranging from mouse genetics to mechanistic biochemistry."

The proposed faculty development project at Prisma Health-Upstate and The University of
South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville (SOMG), Sex and Gender Curricular Assessment
and Revision (SG-CAR), will create innovative and sustainable faculty development materials
for use at SOMG and by other health professions educators across the globe, and it will provide
training to faculty and medical students at SOMG on how to incorporate sex and gender into
medical education. The overall goal of this project is to reduce existing faculty barriers to
integrating sex and gender content into medical curricula by providing faculty with the
knowledge, skills, tools, and practical experience in this work. The project will be led by national
and foundational experts at SOMG in sex and gender health, lifestyle medicine, and medical
education curriculum development. Each Co-PI has a long history of developing educational
resources for faculty development which demonstrates their ability to successfully develop such
projects. Specific Aim 1 of this project will include creating an introductory curriculum that will be
developed for current SOMG faculty emphasizing the importance of sex and gender aspects of
health and disease. Faculty will be provided with a sex and gender curricular assessment
instrument and a curricular revision toolkit created by Dr. Alyson McGregor, Associate Dean at
SOMG, which she piloted successfully at the Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University
in 2021-22. These materials will be refined and validated at SOMG and distributed publicly
through the National Institutes of Health as part of this project. In Specific Aim 2, faculty who
completed the training in Specific Aim 1 will lead teams of students to assess the Lifestyle
Medical Education (LMEd) curriculum for sex and gender content using the assessment
instrument. LMEd is presented by SOMG in strategic partnership with the American College of
Lifestyle Medicine. It is freely available to health professions faculty and is currently accessed
by 28 U.S. medical schools and other schools within 57 countries. In Specific Aim 3, faculty will
lead teams of students using the toolkit to revise the LMEd curricular materials to include sex
and gender content. This will enable these students to publish their work and establish
themselves as future leaders in sex and gender health. The revised LMEd curriculum will be
freely available to educators worldwide through the existing LMEd website. We anticipate a
broad adoption of these faculty development materials. We expect that it will translate to
improved sex and gender specific evidence-based clinical care for women, thus reducing
mortality and morbidity that currently exists among women."

Vocabulary achievement impacts important life outcomes such as academic success, vocational options, and
earning potential. Developmental language disorder is a common disorder which impacts word learning, both
when words are directly taught and when words are learned implicitly after multiple contextual encounters.
Contextual word learning is the most common situation in which words are learned, and this typically occurs
while reading. As such, interventions which increase the effectiveness of contextual word learning have the
potential to meaningfully alter the trajectory of vocabulary growth.
The long term objective of this research program is to develop effective interventions for children with
developmental language disorder, which target contextual word learning while reading. The overall aim of this
study is to test the effectiveness of an intervention which combines two approaches known to be effective in
typical development: metalinguistic training about semantic inferencing, and use of multiple texts with high
semantic diversity. Semantic diversity refers to the range of semantic content in texts which contain the novel
words. In Aim 1, we test the effectiveness of this novel intervention in children with typical development (n=50),
and in Aim 2, we evaluate its effect in children with developmental language disorder (n=50). Participants will
complete a three session metalinguistic intervention involving repeated meaning generation, explanation about
proposed meanings, and feedback about accuracy. The quality of semantic inferencing about novel words
which are untreated (not involved in the intervention) will be measured pre- and post-intervention as a measure
of the effect of intervention on the skill of semantic inferencing. Measures of retention of the semantics of
words used in intervention will be taken one week after each session, and are expected to increase with more
exposure to the metalinguistic intervention. Within sessions, words will be presented in three different semantic
diversity contexts: no diversity (repeated stories), medium diversity (unique stories with the same global
context), and high diversity (unique stories with different global contexts). Based on prior research about the
effect of semantic diversity on word learning in children and adults, we predict that measures of retention of the
semantics of words used in intervention are expected to be highest in the high semantic diversity condition.
Results from this study will be used to support an application for a fully powered randomized controlled trial of
a contextual word learning intervention for children with DLD, and will inform best practices for children with
typical development. The project is innovative because we will examine contextual word learning in
developmental language disorders, we will combine two treatment approaches in a novel way, and because
we focus not only on the effect on treated words, but also on generalization of the skill of semantic inferencing."
10886137,"This application aims to develop improved methods for detecting novel pathogens that can be deployed on a large scale and are flexible to multiple pathogens. The method uses the power of next generation sequencing technology to analyse hundreds of thousands of samples simultaneously. In contrast to standard clinical testing, where one person's sample is tested in a single tube, mass testing labels each person's sample with a unique piece of DNA that acts as a molecular barcode, then pools multiple samples together so that they can be jointly tested. DNA sequencing is then used to detect those samples with virus in the pool of hundreds of thousands of individuals, and assign the virus to the samples it came from on the basis of the molecular barcodes. A bench top sequencer can process tens of thousands a day. A larger machine generates enough sequence to run up to hundreds of thousands of tests in one day. Our aim is to make it possible for a moderately well-equipped molecular biology laboratory to be able to process tens of thousands of samples without much investment. We have successfully deployed SwabSeq testing at the high-complexity, CLIA-certified, UCLA SwabSeq COVID19 Testing laboratory. Our work has demonstrated the utility for high-throughput asymptomatic testing and with additional improvements can increase testing capacity by orders of magnitude, making it possible to deploy testing on a population scale. Our sequencing-based approach can be extended to also detect viral variants at the same time and to other viral pathogens. Mass testing will f nd asymptomatic carriers and thus inform public health policies so that containment of infection will
be effective."

The complexity of cardiomyocyte signaling requires scaffolding proteins to coordinate the cellular processes
driven by receptors and transporters. β-Arrestins are prototypical intracellular scaffold proteins that negatively
regulate cardiac β-adrenergic receptor function via desensitization. Recently, a larger and more ancient family
of structurally related arrestins, termed α-arrestins, has been identified, which shares functions in regulating
transporter trafficking. Txnip, the best-studied member of α-arrestins, serves as an adaptor protein to facilitate
endocytosis of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and suppresses glucose influx through its arrestin domains. We
previously found that targeted deletion of Txnip leads to a substantial metabolic switch, directing
cardiomyocytes toward enhanced glycolytic metabolism under severe ischemia. Despite the potential to
identify new molecular mechanisms, the functions of other α-arrestins, Arrestin domain-containing protein
(Arrdc) 1-5, remain largely undefined in the heart. Here we present preliminary data demonstrating that two α-
arrestins Arrdc4 and Txnip are related to their conserved arrestin domains and share the function to inhibit
GLUT1. Interestingly, this metabolic inhibition was more potent in Arrdc4 than in Txnip. Using our recently-
generated Arrdc4 knockout mouse model, the data reveal exciting findings that inhibition of Arrdc4 enhances
myocardial glucose uptake during hypoxia and improves outcomes after myocardial infarction. These results
define the outlines of an Arrdc4-GLUT1 pathway that may provide a link between cardiac glucose metabolism
and cardiomyocyte survival. This project aims to delineate the molecular nature of this pathway and tests its
role in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. Aim 1 tests three non-exclusive hypotheses by which
Arrdc4 regulates GLUT1 function in cardiomyocytes: (a) specific arrestin domains of Arrdc4 mediate clathrin-
dependent endocytosis of GLUT1; (b) Arrdc4 promotes GLUT1 ubiquitination through an E3 ligase-mediated
pathway; (c) Arrdc4 and Txnip are complementary in the regulation of cardiomyocyte glucose metabolism. Aim
2 employs the Arrdc4 knockout mouse model to test the overall significance of cardioprotection against
myocardial ischemia through a GLUT1-mediated mechanism in vivo. By genetically “reconstituting” the hearts
of Arrdc4 knockout mice with the informative Arrdc4 mutant, this aim also tests the roles of the specific
molecular mechanisms linking Arrdc4 and GLUT1 in ischemic heart disease. Furthermore, using a combination
of virtual screening and cell-based assays, Aim 3 will search for the possible Arrdc4-GLUT1 interaction
inhibitors that may improve energy homeostasis and enhance cardiomyocyte survival under hypoxia. These
studies are highly innovative as we propose a pathway that has never been entertained as a cardiac metabolic
regulator. The resulting knowledge will provide a novel mechanistic basis for understanding the defense
mechanism to protect cardiomyocytes against metabolically-challenging environments under ischemia. Thus,
we believe that the mechanism of action of Arrdc4 will give new and relevant insights into therapeutic strategy."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating dementia with no effective treatment, underscoring the critical
need for better understanding the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease and uncovering new molecular
vulnerabilities to target for therapy. This project addresses an important yet under-studied area of AD
research and aims to discover sialylation-mediated disease processes and novel targets for early diagnosis
and intervention. Protein sialylation is a post-translational modification that covalently attaches sialic acids
(negatively charged nine-carbon monosaccharides also known as neuraminic acids) onto glycoproteins to
generate sialoglycoproteins. Accumulating evidence indicates that sialic acids on sialoglycoproteins not only
affect protein conformation, activity, and trafficking, but also serve as regulators of molecular and cellular
interactions, acting as a biological mask for blocking molecular recognition and/or as a biological recognition
signal for mediating interactions with specific proteins such as Siglecs (sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-
type lectins). Protein sialylation is vital to brain function and homeostasis, as highlighted by the fact that
genetic mutations in enzymes for catalyzing sialylation, desialylation, or sialic acid metabolism cause human
diseases with brain dysfunction and neurological abnormalities. Furthermore, GWAS studies have identified
Siglec-3 (also known as CD33) as a risk factor for AD, underlining the connection between dysregulated
sialylation-mediated signaling and AD pathogenesis. However, very little is currently known about human
brain sialoglycoproteome and its alterations in AD. The proposed project will address this knowledge gap
and use an innovative, multi-faceted approach that combines sialoglycoproteomics, network biology, cell
biology with translational research in human patient specimens to discover and study sialoglycoproteomic
networks and sialylation-based molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying brain function in health and
Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, this project will perform large-scale high-resolution analyses of
sialoglycoproteome changes in human AD and control cerebrospinal fluid, and blood serum samples to
identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and monitoring disease progression. Findings from the proposed
research will advance our understanding of AD pathogenesis and provide novel targets for AD diagnostic
and therapeutic development."

The HLA system encoded on chr6p defines the hematopoietic-cell transplantation barrier. Complete and
precise HLA allele matching of the transplant donor and patient is performed to mitigate the risks of graft
rejection and graft-versus-host disease. These efforts have lowered transplant-related mortality; however,
relapse remains the major cause of transplant failure. The current paradigm for the HLA barrier is based on
data derived principally from individual gene analyses. Yet, HLA region determinants are inherited en bloc as
haplotypes, may confer risks per se, and have synergistic effects with haplotype-linked variants. The clinical
significance of haplotype content or mismatching is not defined. The unmet need is an understanding of the
features of HLA region genes that most strongly predict outcome, their organization on extended haplotypes,
and the role of patient-donor haplotype-matching. If these principles were known, the information would
improve understanding of the immunobiology of the transplant barrier, provide novel approaches for risk-
assessment and optimize donor selection. We elucidated novel roles for HLA-E, HLA-B leader, MICA, MICB, -
DQ heterodimers, -DM and -DO in relapse and survival after haploidentical related and unrelated donor
transplantation. We have identified regional haplotypes of gene features that strongly predict outcome. These
data point to a role for the extended haplotype inclusive of the chr6q ULBP complex, in transplant outcomes.
The Specific Aims are to 1) define the clinical relevance of Hsp70 haplotypes; 2) define the structure and
function of MICA-MICB-ULBP haplotypes; 3) determine the significance of HLA-DM-DO haplotypes in HCT
and 4) define the clinical significance of long-range HLA haplotypes. The goals will be achieved through a
systematic analysis of individual gene features, expression profiles, and haplotypes. We will define long-range
haplotypes that most strongly predict outcome after haploidentical related donor and unrelated donor
transplantation. The significance of haplotype-matching will be elucidated through the definition of haplotypes
of functional features. The information from this project will significantly advance understanding of the
immunogenetic transplantation barrier and offer new approaches for the reduction of relapse and improvement
of survival for future patients."

This application focuses on a novel pathogenic mechanism that includes metal homeostasis,
mitochondrial proteostasis and onset of neurological adverse effects for cognition and movement. We
have identified the mitochondrial RNA granule, as a key initiator of neuronal responses to environmental
and/or genetic insults that predispose an individual to disease. This RNA processing pathway in
mitochondria resides upstream of the effects that have been attributed to manganese toxicity, including
reduced respiratory chain activity, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial oxidative
stress, leading to cell death. Our overall hypothesis is that manganese accumulation in mitochondria
disrupts the mitochondrial RNA granule function and induces dsRNA accumulation as part of the toxicity
mechanism. This disruption leads to the accumulation of dsRNA and reduced OXPHOS function and
increased oxidative stress. Thus, the mitochondrial RNA granule offers us a molecular reporter of
exposure and sensitivity to manganese and a potential target for neuroprotective interventions.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Identify molecular targets of manganese in mitochondria.
Aim 2: Evaluate whether manganese-induced mitochondrial dysfunction induces dsRNA accumulation
and pro-inflammatory responses.
Aim 3: To test to what degree impaired mitochondrial RNA granule function modulates manganese sensitivity
in human brain organoids and brain from wild type and SLC30a10 KO mouse.
Study Design: We will employ cell models with genetic deficiencies in the manganese efflux
transporter SLC30A10, which is sufficient to induce a parkinsonian syndrome in humans, as well as
acutely and chronically manganese treated cells to identify Manganese binding proteins in mitochondria
and to analyze the composition of the mitochondrial RNA granule by mass spectrometry approaches.
RNA granule function will be studied by analyzing the processing of the mitochondrial polycistronic
mitochondrial RNA in manganese challenged cells employing molecular counting with probes directed
at unprocessed junctions in the transcripts. By knockout and over-expression of RNA granule
components, we will assess whether mitochondrial RNA granule dysfunction is deleterious or adaptive.
We will interrogate human brain organoids and mouse brain tissue for the molecular mechanisms
identified in cell line models. Given the significant potential impact of RNA granule on mitochondrial
function, we will evaluate whether drugs affecting mitochondrial RNA processing and downstream
metabolism are neuroprotective to excess manganese exposure or exacerbate genetic vulnerability."

Memory impairment is a defining characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, however, an understanding
of the complex neural mechanisms regulating hippocampal memory formation remains elusive. The sex steroid
17β-estradiol (E2) is a powerful modulator of hippocampal plasticity and memory in both males and females,
however the neural mechanisms through which this occurs are poorly understood. Therefore, the long-term goal
of our research is to pinpoint the neural mechanisms through which E2 regulates hippocampal memory
consolidation in males and females. The overall objectives of this application are to determine the mechanisms
through which E2 regulates activity of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and the extent to which
proteasomal protein degradation contributes to estrogenic regulation of memory consolidation and hippocampal
dendritic spine density in both sexes. Although UPS-mediated protein degradation in the hippocampus is
essential for synaptic remodeling and memory consolidation, the role that UPS activity plays in mediating E2’s
modulatory effects on memory formation and spine remodeling in either sex remains completely unexplored. Our
central hypothesis is that UPS-mediated protein degradation in the DH is triggered by E2 acting at estrogen and
glutamate receptors and is a principal mechanism through which E2 promotes memory consolidation and CA1
spine density. This hypothesis is based on previous work suggesting overlapping mechanisms through which E2
and UPS activity contribute to hippocampal plasticity and memory. Our central hypothesis will be evaluated in
the following three specific aims: 1) determine the cellular mechanisms through which E2 activates hippocampal
UPS activity, 2) identify protein targets of E2-induced UPS activation across subcellular compartments, 3)
establish a key role for proteasome activity in E2-induced facilitation of memory consolidation and CA1 spine
density. Regionally- and temporally- specific pharmacological manipulations will be used to establish receptor
mechanisms underlying E2-UPS interactions in the dorsal hippocampus, as well as the structural and behavioral
outcomes of these interactions. Cutting edge ubiquitin-specific mass spectrometry-based proteomics will also be
used to identify novel proteins targeted by E2 for degradation. This work is innovative in that it represents a
fundamental shift from a conventional focus on protein synthesis as a primary contributor to estrogenic memory
modulation to a novel consideration of protein degradation as an equal and opposite counterpart necessary for
estrogenic regulation of hippocampal plasticity and memory. This contribution is significant because it will provide
essential foundational knowledge about the mechanisms through which E2 regulates memory consolidation in
both sexes, which could lead to the development of novel sex-specific treatments to address the memory
dysfunction observed in numerous mental disorders."
10897870,"ABSTRACT Our overall goal, which is fully responsive to PAR-20-271, is to develop a selective and effective
inhibitor of the multi-functional DNA repair enzyme exonuclease 1 (EXO1) that can be used both as a research
tool (chemical probe) and as a pre-clinical starting point toward the development of a potential cancer therapeutic
drug. There is no EXO1-specific small molecule inhibitor listed in the Chemical Probe Portal or other literature.
We will achieve our goal through discovery research, from implementing a primary high-throughput screen (HTS)
that we have already developed, to validating hits via a well-developed “critical path” of secondary assays, to
performing early hit-to-lead optimization via purchase of commercially available analogs of validated chemical
scaffolds and limited focused medicinal chemistry. EXO1 represents a druggable target, as it contains
functionally essential exonuclease activity for double-strand break response and repair (DSBRR) for processing
of stalled replication forks, which are critical pathways by which cells counteract endogenous DNA damage and
replication stress. Compared to normal cells, cancer cells carry a significantly higher burden of double-strand
breaks and replication stress, which generates a therapeutic window for treating cancer. To exploit this, current
therapeutic approaches primarily target proteins acting in repair pathways or in checkpoint signaling pathways
controlling repair. Many cancer cells are already defective in DSBRR; thus, EXO1 inhibition will cause cancer
cell-specific cell death through a synthetic lethality mechanism. Furthermore, EXO1is will display greater
specificity than currently used PARP inhibitors, because PARPs participate in a wide array of other cellular
processes, whereas EXO1 does not. Our group was the first to clone the human EXO1 gene and to characterize
its biochemical properties. We have expressed and purified the full-length and active EXO1 enzyme at scale,
developed a robust fluorescence-based enzyme inhibition assay, and performed a pilot HTS in our own core
facility. Thus, in collaboration with the Prebys Center of Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute,
we are well positioned to 1) identify inhibitors of EXO1 exonuclease by performing HTS of a well-curated
~320,000 compound library; 2) validate hits for potency and selectivity; 3) perform “structure-activity relationship
(SAR)-by-catalog” and limited focused medicinal chemistry and benchmark absorption, distribution, metabolism,
and excretion (ADME)/pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization of best probes; and 4) determine the mode of
action (MOA) and biological effects of validated EXO1i candidate probes. All of our Aims are responsive to and
within the scope of PAR-20-271. The development of novel EXO1is will not only allow us to provide a critical tool
(i. e. chemical probe) to test mechanistic insights into the replication-repair interface but will also support
development of a novel chemotherapeutic drug that blocks both upstream DNA replication steps and the
downstream DSBRR pathway, with the potential to induce clinical synthetic lethality in breast cancer and other
DSBRR-deficient cancers."

Candidate: Dr. Roy Adams applies for this K25 Mentored Quantitative Research Career Development Award
with the goal of building a productive independent research career as a methodologist focused on developing
electronic health record (EHR)-based models and tools to improve our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRDs). Dr. Adams brings with him excellent training in computational methods for
observational health data but lacks expertise in ADRDs and the methods used to study them. “Big data” is
powerful but understanding the context surrounding the data is essential for knowing the limits of the data and
avoiding bias. The K25 training will support Dr. Adams in becoming an independent ADRD researcher by
allowing him to: (1) develop an understanding of dementia biology and care, (2) gain expertise in the methods
used to model psychiatric measurements, (3) gain exposure to the study of ADRDs from observational data,
and (4) form a network of collaborators in clinical ADRD research. These training aims will be accomplished
through in-person clinical exposure, didactic courses, directed readings and journal groups, and participation in
professional research networks.
Research and Environment: Phenotyping is an essential step of most EHR-based studies of ADRDs. Due to
common sources of error – such as fragmented care and selection bias – phenotyping ADRDs in EHR data
remains a challenge. Recent advances in machine learning present a potential way to account for these
sources of bias in high-dimensional EHR data by combining multiple proxies for the phenotype of interest,
while explicitly modeling the error and bias in each proxy. However, these methods remain limited and
methodological development is needed before they can be applied to ADRD data without risking substantial
bias. The proposed research focuses on developing these methods to extract two types of EHR-based
phenotypes of ADRD: a binary phenotype indicating whether a patient has dementia and a continuous
phenotype measuring the severity of that dementia. Dr. Adams will apply these methods to a large database of
Johns Hopkins EHRs and validate them using a combination of data from a memory center, data from a
parallel ongoing longitudinal study of ADRDs, and assessments of patient severity based on chart review. This
work will take advantage of a unique combination of resources available through the Johns Hopkins
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, the Richman Family Precision Medicine Center of Excellence in
Alzheimer’s Disease, and the Johns Hopkins inHealth Precision Medicine initiative. Further, this research will
provide Dr. Adams with valuable experience working with ADRD patient data, set the foundation for future
methodological work, and generate methods that can be directly applied to several planned and ongoing
ADRD precision medicine studies at Johns Hopkins."

Postpartum depression (PPD) is prevalent and associated with negative outcomes for both mothers and
infants. PPD emerges during a period of psychosocial and neurobiological change, and there is a critical need
for integrated research on trajectories of risk processes. Low activation of RDoC’s positive valence systems
(PVS) prospectively predicts depressive symptoms outside of the peripartum period and may be particularly
relevant for driving social motivation in mother–infant relationships. PVS function is reliably and objectively
measured at the neural level, but very little research has examined brain function across pregnancy. Critically,
psychosocial and neurobiological changes occurring across the peripartum period, including acute stress and
elevated cortisol, are also known to impact PVS function. These disparate lines of research support the
scientific premise of low PVS function as a key risk process in PPD and highlight the need to consider
multimethod trajectories of change in PVS function as predictors of PPD, rather than relying on single
measures and time points. We developed safe, feasible, and robust methods for repeatedly assessing reward-
related brain function across the peripartum period, which we will combine with ecological momentary
assessment of positive affect to chart trajectories of PVS function across the peripartum. For comparison,
similar measures of negative valence systems (NVS) function will also be collected. We will recruit 300
pregnant women in their 2nd trimester (at least 50% classified as high risk for PPD) for an intensive longitudinal
study with follow-up assessments conducted every 10 weeks through 25 weeks postpartum (4 lab and 2 virtual
assessments). PVS function will be assessed from 15 weeks gestation to 5 weeks postpartum. Hair samples
will allow for retrospective assessment of cortisol and other hormones to be estimated from conception through
birth, and acute stress and birth trauma will be measured through gold-standard interviews. At 15 weeks
postpartum, mothers and infants will participate in an observed free play interaction to assess mutual
enjoyment. Depressive symptoms and diagnoses will be assessed from 15 weeks gestation through 25 weeks
postpartum. This innovative study will advance understanding of the role of PVS function in PPD, including
examining PVS function as a prospective predictor of PPD, comparing both baseline functioning vs. trajectories
of change and PVS vs. NVS as predictors of depression (Specific Aim 1). We will also test PVS function across
peripartum as a predictor of new mothers’ experiences of enjoyment in interactions with infants and examine
low mutual enjoyment as a mechanism of the effects of low PVS function on PPD (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we
will test longitudinal associations between acute stressors, cortisol levels, and subsequent PVS function,
providing unique insight into the psychosocial and neurobiological processes shaping PVS function, and
ultimately, depression risk (Specific Aim 3). The study will advance understanding of the dynamic interplay of
processes impacting PVS and inform effective timing and targets for intervention to reduce the burden of PPD."
10884333,"Abstract:
We propose a new ultrasound image formation method, which we call shear-wave reciprocity imaging (SRI), to
produce images based on the sound speed and attenuation of tissue. These acoustic properties carry
important diagnostic information but are not revealed in conventional B-mode images except as artifacts. For
example, in breast imaging the “posterior features” (shadowing/enhancement) BiRADS descriptor depends on
these properties. In contrast to conventional B-mode imaging that produces speckle images of variations in
tissue acoustic impedance, we propose SRI as a method for speckle-free imaging of an attenuation/sound
speed parameter. SRI images are complementary to both B-mode and elastography images yet are produced
using the same backscatter imaging geometry as conventional ultrasound. SRI relies on the principle of
mechanical reciprocity to measure local variations in acoustic radiation force, which relate to attenuation and
sound speed. While using acoustic radiation force impulses similar to ARFI imaging, SRI is designed to be
insensitive to elastic properties and to specifically image the attenuation/sound speed parameter. The aims of
this project are to implement SRI on a linear-array imaging system, characterize its sensitivity and resolution
through in vivo measurements prior to biopsy, and validate SRI in ex vivo breast tissue from mastectomy. We
expect that the additional information provided by SRI will ultimately improve lesion categorization and reduce
the number of biopsies required by replacing qualitative estimates of lesion attenuation from B-mode
shadowing with parametric acoustic images."
10930119,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy that is estimated to become the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2026. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts
for >90% of all pancreatic cancer cases and has an overall five-year survival rate of ~8%, the lowest among the
major cancers. In PDAC, only 15–20% of patients present with localized, resectable, potentially curable tumors
at initial diagnosis. However, currently there is an unmet clinical need for the lack of availability of highly robust
diagnostic strategies for the early detection of PDAC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
regulate genes implicated in every human cancer, including PDAC, and may thus be ideal biomarkers. Indeed,
circulating cell-free miRNAs (cf-miRNAs) have been shown to have diagnostic potential. Furthermore, the recent
discovery that cancer cells actively excrete miRNAs in small extracellular vesicles called exosomes
(exo-miRNAs) has revolutionized the field, as tumor-derived exosomal cargo enables the identification of cancer-
specific molecular markers. During the previous cycle of funding, we performed unbiased and genome-wide
sequencing-based miRNA profiling approaches, together with rigorous bioinformatics and machine-learning
algorithms, and 1) identified panels of 5 cf-miRNAs and 8 exo-miRNAs that could robustly identify patients with
early-stage PDAC; 2) combined the cf- and exo-miRNAs into a “transcriptomic signature” that was superior to
individual biomarker panels, including patients with early-stage (stage I/II) disease; 3) showed that combining
our transcriptomic signature with CA19-9 further improved diagnostic performance; and 4) most importantly,
showed that our transcriptomic signature accurately identified patients with PDAC who were CA19-9-negative.
In this competing renewal application, we will build upon our previous success by undertaking 4 specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will expand our biorepository via continued prospective enrollment of patients with PDAC and
precancerous neoplasms (PNs), including those with pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) and familial risk, with
an additional focus on enrollment of and specimen collection from patients of racial/ethnic minority populations.
In Aim 2, we will further validate the transcriptomic signature and establish its performance in prospective cohorts
of patients with early-stage PDAC. In Aim 3, we will determine the clinical significance of our transcriptomic
signature to detect the presence of high-grade dysplasia and invasive cancer in pre-operative plasma collected
from patients clinically diagnosed as PCNs. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the ability of our transcriptomic signature
to detect PDAC at its earliest stages in pre-diagnosis plasma specimens and to determine lead time before
disease presentation. Our proposed project will be the first to establish a clinically feasible, sensitive, specific,
and robust blood-based assay for identifying patients with PDAC at the earliest possible stages. If successful,
this project will advance a simple, facile, and inexpensive non-invasive assay for routine clinical implementation
that will profoundly transform the early detection of PDAC, with relevance for other cancers."

Cells use post-translational modifications (PTM) to modulate protein function by conjugating and deconjugating modifiers
to protein targets. Imbalance in these reactions leads to human disease. Conjugation of ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFM1)
to protein targets (UFMylation) has been linked to many cellular processes at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In contrast,
much less is known about the roles of UFM1 deconjugation (de-UFMylation), the process of removing UFM1 from
UFMylated proteins. Defects in UFSP2, a de-UFMylation enzyme, were identified in patients with skeletal and
neurodevelopmental disorders. Notably, patient-derived fibroblasts harboring UFSP2 deficiency show excessive amounts
of UFMylation (hyper-UFMylation) and defects in mitochondrial respiration and nucleotide metabolism, indicating as-yet
undescribed roles of UFMylation in cellular metabolism. These findings suggest UFMylation as a novel regulator of
mitochondrial function and nucleotide metabolism. The long-term goal is to understand how UFMylation regulates cellular
metabolism. The overall objective is to understand the molecular mechanism by which UFMylation regulates mitochondrial
respiration and nucleotide metabolism, and the molecular mechanism of action of UFSP2-mediated de-UFMylation. The
central hypothesis is that UFSP2 deficiency causes (i) hyper-UFMylation of mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) and
the electron transport chain (ETC) complex I which change protein localization and/or function, leading to decreased protein
abundance and/or loss-of-function of ETC complexes; and (ii) hyper-UFMylation of enzymes in nucleotide metabolic
pathways, leading to changes in enzyme activity and perturbation of nucleotide metabolism. The rationale is that probing
localization and measuring activity of the hyper-UFMylated mitoribosomes, the ETC Complex I and serine
hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2), will reveal how UFMylation regulates mitochondrial respiration and nucleotide
metabolism. In addition, the structure of UFSP2 in complex with UFMylated targets will reveal the structural basis for
substrate recognition and de-UFMylation reaction. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Determine how hyper-UFMylation of mitoribosomes and Complex I impairs mitochondrial respiration; 2) Investigate the
effect of hyper-UFMylation of SHMT2 on nucleotide metabolism; and 3) Determine the structural basis for substrate
recognition and deconjugation reaction of human UFSP2. For the first aim, protein abundance, localization and enzyme
activity of mitochondrial ribosomes and the ETC Complex I will be measured in patient-derived UFSP2-depleted versus
WT UFSP2 cells. For the second aim, isotope tracing will be used to evaluate metabolic rates of serine and nucleotide
synthesis, while the localization and enzyme activity of SHMT2 will be assessed in patient-derived UFSP2-depleted versus
WT UFSP2 cells. For the third aim, the UFSP2 in complex with its UFM1-conjugated substrate will be trapped, purified
and structure-determined. The research proposed is innovative because it will elucidate the roles of de-UFMylation and the
effects of UFMylation on cellular metabolism for the first time. The proposed research is significant because it (1)
contributes to the identity of the UFMylome, (2) reveals UFMylation as a novel regulator of mitochondrial respiration and
nucleotide metabolism, and (3) reveals the structural basis for substrate recognition and deconjugation reaction of UFSP2."

Obstetric disorders are common globally and a major driver for deaths of children under five as
well as other lifelong health issues. Despite this we have a limited understanding of the
mechanisms driving these disorders highlighting an unmet research gap. Here, we collaborate
with Dr. Yoel Sadovsky to compile a deep-phenotyping pregnancy dataset that evaluates
women’s health throughout pregnancy providing longitudinal blood and urine multiomics data
paired with clinical, survey, behavioral, and environmental data collected from 200 people (100
people with adverse outcomes) providing a comprehensive view of pregnancy. We hypothesize
that a data-driven systems biology approach will define normal placental and pregnancy
systems biology and facilitate investigation of disease mechanisms in common obstetric
disorders including preterm birth, fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. First, we will
evaluate molecular network differences in common obstetric disorders using placental
multiomics (metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) data paired with clinical and
placental histopathology data collected from 342 people (213 with common obstetric disorders).
We will build inter-omic placental networks across datatypes and outcomes increasing our
understanding of placental biology. We will also determine differences in molecular network
structures and key transcription factors associated with distinct obstetric disorders. In addition,
we will use the deep-phenotyping pregnancy data to evaluate molecular network dynamics and
define major transition states of pregnancy. We will also use it to identify disruptions to
molecular networks associated with common obstetric disorders. We will also develop a new
approach to identify analyte outliers in individuals at the earliest time point of deviation from a
healthy pregnancy trajectory, prototyping a precision medicine approach in the context of
pregnancy. Finally, we are partnering with Google Data Commons to build an open-source
perinatal-specific knowledge graph to distribute the data from this proposal to the broader
perinatal research community. Altogether this will generate and prioritize hypotheses of the
molecular mechanisms of common obstetric disorders, which will be used to develop future
clinical interventions to promote maternal-fetal health. Finally, this work will provide me with the
background needed to establish an independent line of research."

We live in an era of contaminated drinking water. Potable water reuse, climate change, population growth, and
intensive farming are factors that drive this contamination. Concurrently drinking water contaminants have been
linked with epidemic diseases such as cancer, obesity, dysregulation of the gastrointestinal systems, impaired
mental functions, and other developmental and reproductive diseases. Toxic pollutants in drinking water are
particularly hazardous for fetal and infant health. They are more vulnerable to harmful contaminants because
their organs and tissues are still developing. Previous studies have targeted gut microbiota as an active player
of that association. However, the mechanisms underlying these impairments remain poorly defined due to
challenges associated to the identification of microbiome-mediated relationships between external factors (i.e.,
diet and contaminants) and host metabolism. Due to the massive number of organic micropollutants, monitoring
using targeted chemical analyses alone is insufficient to assess drinking water quality, covering only a very small
subset of the chemicals. Finally, current health risks of drinking water contaminants are typically assessed one
chemical at a time, an approach that misses the health impacts of co-occurring contaminants in drinking water
and their potential synergistic effects. My central hypothesis is that current tap and well water quality
assessments underestimate our exposure to organic contaminants in drinking water and their impact on fetal
and infant health. My long-term goals are to (1) improve drinking water quality assessments, by applying high-
throughput identification and prioritization strategies of contaminant mixtures, as well as (2) elucidate causal
relationships between drinking water contaminants and negative health outcomes in children, specifically those
related to neurological conditions. Current knowledge of the risks associated with drinking water contaminants
is limited due to the challenges associated with their detection, identification, and testing. Therefore, my overall
objectives for this application are to (1) apply high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and in vitro and in
vivo effect-directed analysis (EDA) to expand the coverage of current water monitoring strategies; (2) select and
prioritize chemical candidates based on their occurrence, abundance, and toxicity; (3) evaluate associations
among prioritized contaminants and water sources according to zip code and open source information found in
the Oregon Drinking Water Services at the Public Health Division Website; (4) identify gut metabolites whose
variation explains the association between specific gut microbes and zebrafish endpoints; (5) and provide a
comprehensive list of prioritized chemicals and mixtures found in rural and drinking water in Oregon. This study
will help members from the EPA and DEQ make better informed decisions related to further chemical regulations
in drinking water. This application responds to the first theme of the NIEHS strategic plan 2018-2023, Advancing
Environmental Health Sciences (EHS), by studying the effects of contaminant mixtures of emerging concern,
predictive toxicology, and microbiome responses."

Over 356,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur in the US each year, nearly 90% of which
are fatal.2 While 99.7% of OHCA in patients over age 60 are cardiac in etiology, a meaningful proportion of OHCA
for patients between 20 and 59 years of age are drug-related.3 We previously used data from the NHLBI-funded
Postmortem Systematic Investigation of Sudden Cardiac Death (POST SCD)4 to investigate the prevalence of
occult drug-related cardiac arrest. We found that 10.3% of OHCA in San Francisco between 2011-2016 were
due to occult opioid overdose5 – cases without a history or evidence of drug use that would otherwise have been
attributed to a non-overdose cause, such as sudden cardiac death. While it is currently unknown whether
naloxone – an opioid receptor competitive antagonist – is beneficial to patients experiencing opioid-associated
(OA)-OHCA, a recent American Heart Association scientific statement identified the rigorous evaluation of
naloxone’s efficacy in OA-OHCA as an important knowledge gap.1 However, no evidenced-based method to
identify OA-OHCA in real-time currently exists, making the targeted-evaluation of naloxone’s efficacy in this
group difficult. Our study team leveraged data from the POST SCD study to develop the NAloxone Cardiac
ARrest Decision Instrument (NACARDI) – two exam-based criteria that improve the pre-test probability of occult
OA-OHCA from 10.3% to 20.6%.6 These criteria were derived from patients in San Francisco County who died
of OHCA in the field. The objective of this K38 grant is to answer two outstanding questions: 1) Are the NACARDI
criteria valid in OHCA patients who survive to the emergency department (ED), and 2) Are the NACARDI criteria
externally generalizable outside of San Francisco? My central hypothesis is that the NACARDI criteria are
externally valid and generalizable for identifying patients at risk for occult OA-OHCA. My long-term goal is to use
the results of this K38 to develop validated inclusion criteria for a future multi-center NACARDI-enriched clinical
trial of naloxone in suspected OA-OHCA. Aim 1 of this proposal will validate the NACARDI criteria in OHCA
patients who survived to the ED by calculating screening characteristics for NACARDI in a retrospective cohort
of all OHCA patients who were transported to two major hospitals in San Francisco between 2011-2021, using
blood and urine toxicology screens to identify OA-OHCA. Aim 2 will refine and externally validate the NACARDI
criteria using data from the Canadian Sudden Cardiac Arrest Network (C-SCAN), an EMS- and coroner-based
dataset of OHCA patients who died in the field in Toronto, Canada between 2018-2022. Occult opioid overdose
will be identified in the C-SCAN dataset through medical examiner adjudication. The NACARDI criteria are
innovative because they allow for evidence-based real-time identification of patients at risk for occult OA-OHCA,
instead of relying on the current practices of retrospective evaluation via autopsy or post-arrest toxicology testing.
The proposed research is significant because identifying patients during a resuscitation who are at risk for occult
OA-OHCA is necessary to design an ethical and successful clinical trial of naloxone in this population."

Obesity is at epidemic proportions in the US. Over 60% of the population is either overweight (Body Mass
Index [BMI] ≥25 to <30 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), placing them at risk for a large number of chronic
diseases, including insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The annual costs of obesity
exceed $100 billion, making it one of the most significant public health and economic issues facing the country.
Unfortunately, the treatment of obesity is unsatisfactory. Lifestyle and behavioral approaches have a modest,
and often transient, effect while FDA-approved therapeutic options targeting appetite or fat absorption have
poor tolerability and, in some cases, safety concerns. Thus, there is a critical need for novel approaches to
treat obesity. Agents acting via peripheral mechanisms to increase energy expenditure would be valuable. The
sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is well-known as an activator of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the
“browning” of cells in white adipose tissue (WAT) depots to increase uncoupled mitochondrial respiration and
energy expenditure. Our earlier work established signaling cascades from β-adrenergic receptors (βARs) 
cAMP  protein kinase A (PKA)  p38 MAP kinase (MAPK), and also from PKA to mTORC1. These
downstream signaling modules are key to drive the transcription of brown adipocyte genes such as uncoupling
protein-1 (UCP1), PPAR-gamma coativator-1α (PGC-1α), and the broader program of mitochondrial
biogenesis. The Scientific Premise of this project is based upon our identification of substrates of PKA-
activated mTORC1 that convey the brown-adipose promoting machinery, and we will determine their molecular
mechanisms. Our long-term goal is to define signaling pathways that are critical to metabolic and
cardiovascular disease and, using this knowledge, to target pivotal components of these signaling pathways to
prevent or reverse the diseases."

 The long term goal of the application is to understand why and how bacterial lipoproteins in the medically
important Firmicutes phylum undergo structural modifications. Lipoproteins are membrane associated proteins
tethered to the bacterial surface through an acylated N-terminal cysteine anchor. They are ubiquitous cell
envelope structures in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, playing key roles in nearly every aspect
of bacterial cell envelope physiology. Due to their functional importance, abundance, universal distribution, and
the structurally unique acylated N-terminal cysteine, the innate immune system detects bacteria by binding the
N-terminus of lipoproteins using the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) family. TLR2 activation triggers a pro-
inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response to clear bacteria as well as to orchestrate humoral immunity.
However, there is emerging evidence that acylation patterns in lipoproteins from the Firmicutes phylum are not
canonical TLR2 ligands nor are they static in structure. Firmicutes synthesize lipoprotein chemotypes varying in
acyl chain number, length, and attachment position using an array of accessory lipoprotein biosynthetic genes.
Gene distribution varies at both the genera and species level, and can even differ at the strain level due to
circulating plasmid/transposon encoded lipoprotein remodeling genes. Lipoprotein composition is also
dynamically regulated by the growth environment, including copper which has been shown to induce expression
of certain N-terminal modifying genes. This project aims to uncover the physiological need(s) for distinct
lipoprotein N-terminal modification systems and to characterize the enzymes involved. While select lipoprotein
structural modifications confer TLR2 evading capabilities in host associated bacteria, lipoprotein N-terminal
acylation/acetylation is also found in environmental lineages which suggests a broad selective pressure. Given
copper co-induces both lipoprotein N-terminal modification and copper resistance genes, it has been proposed
that copper directly binds to the free N-terminus and inhibits cell growth unless N-modified. This project will
investigate the impact of N-terminal lipoprotein modifications on copper binding by measuring growth under
copper challenge conditions requiring specific lipoprotein functions, using Tn-seq to compare chemotype-specific
copper sensitization gene networks, and assaying oxidative damage to model lipopeptides isolated from both
actively respiring cells and under in vitro reaction conditions. In the second aim, the recently discovered
lipoprotein N-acylating enzymes LnsAB from Staphylococcus aureus will be reconstituted. Targeted mutations,
acyl chain donor, and possible protein-protein complex formation will be examined using genetic and biochemical
approaches. The final part of the project will examine how N-acetylated lipoproteins are made using genetic
transposon screens and biochemical assays, and what impact lipoprotein acetylation has on key phenotypes.
By understanding lipoprotein synthesis, the project will shed light on the complex interplay between lipoprotein
chemotype, copper exposure, TLR2 recognition, and in turn a critical axis governing host-Firmicutes interactions."
10933437,"The LISTOS Research Capacity Building Core (RCBC) will accomplish the following
aims: (1) develop a two-tiered training and mentoring program to build implementation
research capacity for cancer control in Mexico and Latin America; (2) establish three
implementation science (IS) capacity-building units (training & resources, implementation
strategies, and methods & measurement) to coordinate and support the training and mentoring
program; and (3) create an implementation research pilot program for cancer control in Mexico
and Latin America.
 In accomplishing these aims, the RCBC will address key gaps that have plagued capacity
building efforts for cancer control implementation research in LMIC settings. This core will
target gaps in capacity building through enhanced mentoring, coaching, and technical
assistance; provide novel and innovative methods of developing the capacity of investigators in
Mexico and Latin America specific to their needs; conduct trainings and develop tools in
Spanish to overcome language barriers; and establish a pilot program to expand the impact of
RCBC efforts. The three functional units of the RCBC will include investigators from all partner
institutions, fostering a collaborative environment that allows for two-way dialogue between
local practitioners and healthcare organization partners in Mexico and Latina American, and
between Mexican (INSP, INCan) and US-based IS partners (UTHealth, UCSF).
 Innovative capacity building strategies will be supported through the RCBC, including
establishing Project ECHO programs in Mexico and supporting participation by local
investigators in D&I certificate programs. Key outputs of RCBC activities will include the
adaptation of and training LISTOS partners on key implementation research tools.
Implementation research tools and training will be made available to investigators in LISTOS
networks in Mexico and Latin America, as well as to members of the U54 Global Cancer
Consortium. RCBC efforts will build the capacity of a cadre of outstanding young investigators
from Mexico and Latin America to conduct cancer IS research and address cancer related health
inequities in Latin America."
10738764,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Given the pivotal role of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins in cancer cell survival and resistance to
chemotherapy, the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics targeting the BH3 binding groove of anti-
apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have emerged as a promising, yet challenging therapeutic goal. The recent approval of
Venetoclax (ABT199), a selective Bcl-2 antagonist whose design and development spanned well over fifteen
years of iterative optimizations using extensive structure-based refinements, suggested that it is indeed possible,
albeit extremely challenging, to attain inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) that are clinically
relevant. However, we and others found that overexpression of both Mcl-1 and, perhaps more relevant, Bfl-1
(two other members of the Bcl-2 family protein that are not targeted by Venetoclax), confer resistance to
chemotherapy and to Bcl-2 antagonists. Recent efforts from our laboratory identified possible novel routes to
design potent and selective inhibitors of PPIs targeting these oncogenes that encompass structure-based design
of covalent inhibitors. Hence, we propose to further investigate these innovative structure-guided drug discovery
strategies and to apply them to the design of potent dual Mcl-1/Bfl-1 antagonists. If successful, our studies could
result in general methods to target PPIs and could also identify innovative lead compounds for the treatment of
cancer."
10738818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trauma affects the vast majority of people (50-89%) during their lifetime, and it can have lasting impacts on not
only psychiatric but also cardiovascular health. Both trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD)—the quintessential trauma-related psychiatric disorder—have been linked prospectively to increased
risk of developing a range of cardiovascular outcomes. However, as described in a recent NHLBI Working
Group report, critical knowledge gaps must be addressed before trauma or its psychiatric sequelae might be
novel targets for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Indeed, our current understanding is limited by a
disproportionate focus on PTSD when examining subsequent CVD risk in trauma-exposed individuals.
Posttraumatic psychopathology manifests in heterogeneous ways (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance abuse)
that have been linked to elevated CVD risk in non-trauma-exposed samples. Further, despite differences in the
prevalence and manifestations of posttraumatic psychopathology and CVD in men and women, few studies
have directly examined sex differences in these associations. The field's ability to investigate these questions
has been hampered by a lack of rigorous measures of trauma exposure and posttraumatic psychopathology in
most existing electronic medical record databases, which have extensive data on CVD outcomes. This study
will address these knowledge gaps by harnessing a unique prospective, population-based trauma cohort in
order to characterize “cardiotoxic” manifestations of posttraumatic psychopathology in men and women. This
trauma cohort was created using Danish electronic health registry (EHR) data as part of R01MH110453 (PI:
Gradus), and it identified over 1.4 million individuals exposed to a trauma between 1994 and 2016. This
established data source includes rich, highly valid, and complete registry-based data with up to 25 years of
follow-up on psychiatric and cardiovascular diagnoses following trauma. We will use this existing resource,
restricted to persons age 18 years and older with no prior CVD events (n = 1,068,100), to comprehensively
examine posttraumatic psychopathology as a predictor of incident CVD. In Aim 1, we will harness cutting edge,
novel data science techniques (machine learning) to identify particularly “cardiotoxic” manifestations of
psychopathology after trauma. Given sex differences in psychiatric disorders and CVD, sex-specific
psychopathology profiles associated with incident CVD risk will be examined in stratified analyses. In Aim 2,
we will use traditional analyses to quantify discovered psychiatric predictors and unanticipated/novel
psychiatric comorbidity profiles associated with CVD risk in the machine learning analyses, as well as a priori
literature-based combinations of psychiatric disorders that increase CVD risk. This EHR-based trauma cohort
provides a unique opportunity to consider comprehensively the constellation of posttraumatic psychopathology
that may predict CVD, and the results of this study will be used to ultimately inform the development of
targeted CVD prevention efforts in trauma-exposed populations."
10889262,"ABSTRACT
A leading goal of our research is identification of the key metabolic pathways directing hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) fate decisions. While early findings suggested that HSCs depend mainly on glycolysis, emerging evidence
from our lab and others has shown that mitochondrial metabolism, and particularly fatty acid oxidation, is
essential to HSC fate determination. We hypothesize that mitochondrial metabolism is remodeled at the initiation
of the fate choice process to meet the changing needs of proper HSC function. However, our understanding of
the relationship between HSC self-renewal and lipid metabolism remains limited. To identify metabolite-
dependent pathways, we have used an adapted gene expression-oriented bioinformatics tool and our own
metabolomics analyses. We have also established a biosensor for assessment of fatty acid oxidation activity in
live cells to determine the metabolic modes which are relevant to the controlled equilibrium of HSCs. Quantitative
live imaging and our single cell approaches will illuminate the processes of symmetric or asymmetric
mitochondrial segregation during HSC division. Our innovative local transplantation system will allow us to
monitor the migration and cell divisions of single HSCs in vivo, and our established image-guided technique of
micropipette aspiration of individual cells directly from the bone marrow of live animals will enable subsequent
single-cell assay. Analysis of the resulting data will yield new insights into the fate decision process of HSCs,
and facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for shifting the division balance of HSCs toward self-
renewal through metabolic manipulation. The goals of this proposal are three-fold: (1) In Aim 1, we will induce
the selective consumption of metabolites localized in the mitochondria to identify metabolic targets of fatty acid
metabolism that affect HSC fate; (2) in Aim 2, we will use pharmacological or genetic modulation of key genes
impacting fatty acid oxidation or its downstream targets to define the metabolic crosstalk between mitochondria
and the cytosol; and (3) in Aim 3 we will evaluate the coordinated process that yields HSC division symmetry in
vivo, and analysis of division balance will provide insights into the in vivo relevance of fatty acid metabolisms to
HSC fate choice. If successful, the proposed research will positively impact the field by providing a deeper
understanding of the metabolic cues coordinating HSC fate decisions, and will suggest potential methods of
shifting the division balance of HSCs toward self-renewal through metabolic manipulation to improve clinical
outcomes after transplantation."
10889260,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the betacoronavirus “severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2) represents an unprecedented public health emergency. Most patients
with COVID-19 clear the virus upon resolution of the acute infection but ongoing, persistent, SARS-CoV-2
replication has been documented in immunocompromised individuals. In these chronically infected patients,
recovery of replication-competent virus over several weeks to months is linked to stepwise acquisition of
mutations within and outside of spike. Our preliminary data show that such prolonged intra-host viral evolution
plays a role in the emergence of new, antigenically distinct, SARS-CoV-2 variants. We propose to systematically
elucidate the determinants of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infections using an integrated translational research
approach combining real-world clinical metadata with bioinformatics, genomics and molecular virology. We will
leverage an existing large surveillance dataset covering two and a half years of SARS-CoV-2 spread in New
York City going back to the beginning of the pandemic in the spring of 2020 when the NY metropolitan area
emerged as one of the early epicenters of the pandemic. Specific Aim 1 will dissect the clinical features and
therapeutic interventions associated with persistent SARS-CoV-2 replication using existing longitudinal data from
electronic medical records. These studies will be complemented by the analysis of the B and T cell populations
of persistently infected patients. Specific Aim 2 will dissect the viral genotypes representative of intra-host
evolution of prolonged periods with a special emphasis on co-circulating viral variants. Specific Aim 3 will
examine the phenotypic properties of persistent SARS-CoV-2 variants with an emphasis on convergent evolution
within and outside of the spike region (susceptibility to neutralization, fusogenicity, spike processing and
interferon antagonism).
Altogether, the proposed studies address a critical knowledge gap regarding the biological drivers and viral
dynamics fueling the selection of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants during persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. This
knowledge will provide the scientific basis needed to treat and prevent such chronic infections thereby limiting
the emergence and spread of increasingly neutralization-resistant yet transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants."
10929451,"Currently there are no therapies that can slow or reverse the cognitive decline seen in late-onset Alzheimer's
disease (LOAD). The single greatest risk factor for this condition is chronological age and as the global population
ages, the number of AD cases is expected to continue to rapidly increase. This age-dependent association has
led many to suggest that strategies that slow or reverse aspects of brain aging might be of particular use in
patients with LOAD. In normal human subjects, there is an age-dependent decline in brain NAD+ levels and in
animal models, a decline in brain NAD+ is strongly associated with aging and cognitive decline, while restoring
NAD+ can improve cognitive function. Moreover, evidence suggests that in pre-clinical AD models, there is an
accelerated loss of NAD+ and that neurons are particularly vulnerable to a reduction in intracellular NAD+ levels.
It is well established that the rate limiting enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway is nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and that the enzymatic activity of NAMPT largely determines the level of
NAD+ within cells. Here, we describe an early stage drug development proposal to advance a brain penetrant,
small molecule that augments NAMPT activity, thus increasing neuronal NAD+ levels and combating brain aging.
We describe the development plan of this molecule up to the IND filing stage. The ultimate clinical indication for
such a molecule would be in patients with LOAD and mild cognitive impairment. We have assembled a team
with extensive drug development and AD experience, both in the pre-clinical and clinical arena. This proposal
describes a series of milestones and go/no go decision points to advance our current set of three distinct
chemical series, all of which directly bind to NAMPT and increase enzymatic activity, to a single final clinical
candidate that would be ready to advance to Phase I testing in human subjects. This compound would be a first-
in-class small molecule that seeks to reverse the age-dependent decline in NAD+ levels as a means to treat mild
cognitive impairment in LOAD patients."
10909303,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Soon after birth, most infants develop the optimal refractive error (i.e., “clinical” emmetropia) in both eyes that
is maintained throughout childhood and into adult life. However, for reasons not currently understood, a
significant and rapidly increasing proportion of the population develop myopia, or nearsightedness. Because of
structural changes that take place as the eye becomes myopic, even low degrees of myopia pose a significant
risk for multiple blinding conditions. As a consequence, myopia is now one of the leading causes of permanent
visual impairment in the world. Additionally, myopia represents a substantial economic burden. In addition to
lost productivity, billions of dollars are spent annually on optical corrections and pathologies caused by myopia.
The long-term goal of our research program is to provide a better understanding of the etiology of common
forms of myopia, juvenile and early adult-onset myopia, and to develop effective treatment strategies that
reduce the burden of myopia. The specific aims of our proposed research are to determine how visual
experience affects refractive development, to characterize the operational properties of the vision-dependent
mechanisms that regulate eye growth, and to explore new pharmaceutical approaches to eliminate myopia.
Our purpose is to generate knowledge that can be applied to the human eye; however, many of the required
experiments cannot be conducted in humans. Therefore, these experiments will be conducted using rhesus
monkeys. Previous studies in our lab and others show that characteristics of light, such as intensity,
wavelength, and duration of exposure, influence eye growth. Potential mechanisms include alterations in
retinal and choroidal visual cascades and ocular remodeling, particularly of the sclera, the outermost coat of
the eye. Preliminary data also show that prostaglandin analogs and alpha-adrenergic agonists influence eye
growth. Here, controlled rearing strategies, rigorous optical and biometric techniques, and histopathological
investigation will be used to determine: 1) the effects of duration and dosing of red light exposure on in vivo
eye growth and myopia and on in vitro human scleral fibroblast culture and 2) whether prostaglandin analogs
and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists can slow the development of myopia. The role of scleral fibroblast activity,
scleral remodeling, and intraocular pressure in eye growth will be examined. The proposed experiments focus
on fundamental issues concerning the manner in which visual experience influences refractive development.
Findings will be important in determining how and to what extent visual experience contributes to the genesis
of common human refractive errors. More importantly, the results of these studies will potentially provide the
scientific foundation for novel treatment and management strategies for the most common forms of myopia in
children to prevent and slow the progression of myopia, increase quality of life, reduce the risk of associated
pathologies, and decrease the economic burden caused by myopia."
10911344,"The proposed hybrid type 1 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial will probe the effects of brief
behavioral therapy (STEP-UP) for youths with anxiety and/or depression recruited from low-resource
primary care community health centers (CHCs) that serve a diverse population of vulnerable families.
Anxiety and mood disorders in youth are prevalent and impairing, with high current and lifetime comorbidity in
part due to shared etiologic factors. Untreated, these disorders lead to sustained functional impairment and
convey increased risk for recurrent disorder and suicide. Only 1 in 5 anxious and 2 in 5 depressed youth report
any lifetime mental health use, the lowest treatment rates for any youth mental health condition. In addition,
there are notable disparities in care, with families experiencing high social determinants of health (SDOH)
burden and minority youths significantly less likely to receive mental health services than similarly affected, but
less disadvantaged, youths. Further, families who are served in safety-net settings such as CHCs often
experience multiple, intersectional risks and barriers to evidence-based care. Therefore, effective treatment
of anxiety and depression is a critical public health priority, especially for traditionally underserved
youths. STEP-UP is a streamlined transdiagnostic behavioral intervention developed to efficiently treat anxiety
and depression as a unified problem area by targeting avoidance behavior common to both disorder classes.
The proposed study builds on a successful multi-site RCT of STEP-UP based in primary care with an insured
population of youths. To increase dissemination potential to low-resource CHCs, we have adapted the program
from a face-to-face format to a digital health framework and developed a Spanish-language translation. Pilot
studies of this revised version of STEP-UP have shown feasibility and acceptability; however, data on clinical
effectiveness are still needed in this new setting (CHC) and sample (high SDOH risk). Thus, we propose to
conduct an innovative, 5-year hybrid effectiveness-implementation study (Type 1) rigorously testing the
clinical effectiveness of the digital health version of STEP-UP, while simultaneously collecting data to plan
future CHC implementation trials. Youths (age 8.0-16.5, N=220) will be identified and recruited through
electronic health records (EHR) and clinician referral. Eligible youths will be randomized to (a) STEP-UP or
(b) facilitated referral to TAU in the community (TAU+). Clinical effectiveness will be assessed by masked
independent evaluators at STEP-UP post-treatment (Week 16) and at follow-up (Week 32). Implementation
data will be pulled from: (a) surveys of CHC leaders, (b) surveys of and interviews with STEP-UP clinicians,
and (c) EHR and CHC administrative data. Specific aims include testing the clinical effectiveness of STEP-UP
and engagement of the intervention mechanism (Aim 1), probing cost effectiveness (Aim 2), testing SDOH
predictors and moderators to evaluate robustness of effects (Aim 3), and identifying target mechanisms for
future implementation trials using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Aim 4)."
10881789,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
After several decades of intensive efforts from academia and industry, targeting KRAS using KRAS-specific
inhibitors (KRASi) such as sotorasib and adagrasib has finally become a clinical reality. However, clinical
reponses to KRASi vary widely across different cancer types (higher in lung cancer, but much lower in colon and
panceraic cancers) and are typically not durable. Importantly, cancers that eventually became resistant to KRASi
were found to have acquired secondary mutations that restore KRAS signaling. For these patients, there is still
a strong need for therapeutic combinations that can abrogate KRAS signaling pathways such as the RAF-MEK-
ERK (MAPK) or PI3K-AKT cascades. To meet these clinical needs, Project 2 of the WU-PDTC aims at testing
three novel therapeutic combinations to deepen the therapeutic response of KRASi in different KRAS-mutant
cancer PDXs. Because these combinatorial strategies were developed from panceratic cancer models, we will
also preform start-of-the-art proteo-transcriptomic analyses to determine the shared and distinct primary and
secondary resistance mechanisms of pancreatic, lung and colon cancer PDXs to KRAS and MAPK pathwya
inhibtiors. Our project capitalizes on the large repertoire of genetically-defined PDX models from different cancer
types, is based on novel exciting biology, supported by state-of-the-art technqiues including innovative 3D-
heterotypic culture model, spatio-transcriptomics, snRNAseq, multiplex immunohistochemistry and an
outstanding bioinformatic team. We have strong institutional commitment to provide additional fund to ensure
this Project is smoothly executed. Our novel therapeutic concepts are based on therapeutic agents that are
already in clincial trials. If successful, results from our Project can be immediately translated into biomarker-
driven clinical trials under the NCI Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network, in which WU is an active
participating member."
10844641,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a normal constituent of the intestinal and vaginal flora
in 15–30% of healthy adults. The bacterium can, however, cause infections in elderly and
immunocompromised patients, and pregnant women, and is the main cause of fatal invasive
disease in newborns. GBS translocation through epithelial, endothelial, and placental barriers is
facilitated by a pore-forming toxin β-hemolysin, also known as the β-hemolytic pigmented lipid
or granadaene. To identify factors involved in the regulation of β-hemolysin expression we
developed new peptide-free culture media for screening of a transposon mutant library of GBS
CJB111. The pilot screens identified nine novel genetic loci associated with positive and
negative modulation of β-hemolysin expression. Based on preliminary findings, we hypothesize
that GBS possesses a regulatory mechanism that tailors β-hemolysin expression to the
environment. To unravel the mechanism, we will employ transposon mutant library screening,
RNA-seq and metabolomics analyses, isolation, and de novo sequence determination of
secreted peptide-based repressors. The results of this exploratory work have the potential to
lead to the development of a novel inhibitor of the invasion state of GBS."

Established in 2003, the DILIN currently has 6 clinical centers and one data coordinating center and is recruiting
eligible patients with well-defined idiosyncratic DILI into two ongoing multicenter prospective studies. Indiana
University is one of the founding clinical centers and has robustly participated in all DILIN operations since its
inception. The RFA DK-22-013 was issued to address several new objectives with regards to its risk factors,
causality, clinical features and natural history, and potential therapies. We propose the following specific aims to
meet the goals of this RFA. Specific Aim # 1: To enroll large number of eligible adults with suspected DILI into
ongoing DILIN prospective, acute liver injury, and retrospective studies. We propose to collect prospective and
retrospective cases of suspected DILI from multiple sources in Central Indiana, each providing distinctive
epidemiological facets and research potential. We propose to utilize the medical informatics and health
information exchange infrastructure established by the Regenstrief Institute for Health Care. A special focus of
this aim is to robustly enroll the following subpopulations with intense focus on racial and ethnic diverse patients
with suspected DILI. Specific Aim # 2: To conduct two distinct ancillary studies, each one adding significantly
to our understanding of DILI. These include: (a) To test the hypothesis that plasma whole transcriptome cell-free
mRNA serves as an important approach to better understand the mechanisms, phenotypic presentation, and
outcomes of patients with suspected DILI. We will conduct plasma cf-mRNA RNA-Seq profiling of patients with
suspected acute DILI at baseline and during follow-up to delineate cf-mRNA signatures associated with acute
DILI and its phenotypes and outcomes. (b) To test the hypothesis that HLA variants are associated with DILI due
to selected agents. This objective builds on successful investigations conducted by DILIN during the current
funding period. Specific Aim # 3: DILI carries considerable mortality and morbidity but there is no treatment
available other than withdrawing the offending agent. To address this unmet therapeutic need, we propose to
conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of saroglitazar, a novel PPARα/γ agonist in
individuals with well characterized cholestatic DILI meeting predefined eligibility criteria. Our hypothesis is that
saroglitazar, a potent PPARα agonist attenuates cholestasis and improves recovery of patients with cholestatic
DILI. Sixty individuals with definite, highly likely or probable DILI with R<2 and total bilirubin > 3 mg/dL will be
randomized to receive either saroglitazar (1 mg once daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. Primary efficacy endpoint is
normalization of serum alkaline phosphatase after 4 weeks of intervention. Specific Aim # 4: The objective is to
robustly participate in all cross-consortia activities including participating and leading (where appropriate)
steering committee, genetics committee, ancillary studies committee, publications and presentations committee,
causality committee, and herbal and dietary supplements (HDS) committee activities."
10931656,"Project Summary
This proposal addresses three major challenges in adoptive cellular therapy: 1) T cell persistence; 2) Tumor
immune resistance and 3) Target epitope identification for solid tumors, bringing together the expertise of Dr.
Yee in T cell therapy, Dr. Rai in epigenetics and Dr. Morelli in clinical trials. We have established a strategy for
generating memory T cells from peripheral blood of patients, via an ACT modality known as Endogenous T Cell
(ETC) therapy pioneered in the Yee lab, allowing us to target HORMAD1, a cancer testis antigen broadly
expressed in gastric and esophageal cancer, which in its advanced stages represents a significant unmet need.
By applying rationally designed combinations of epigenetic modulators we plan to optimize the replicative
capacity and memory properties of HORMAD1-specific CTL (HMD-CTL) generate ex vivo to address the
challenge of limited in vivo T cell persistence (UG3 Aim 1). One of the dominant extrinsic factors mediating tumor
immune resistance in gastric and esophageal cancer is the influence of TGF-β in the tumor microenvironment.
In addressing this challenge, we propose the use of a dominant negative TGF-β receptor to sequester TGF-β by
engineering expression of the TGFBDNR2 gene into HORMAD1-specific CTL using a retroviral transduction
strategy that is well-established in the Cell Therapy Manufacturing Center (UG3 Aim 2). Finally, addressing the
challenge of targeting gastric and esophageal cancers was borne out of an ongoing antigen discovery pipeline
developed over 5 years examining the portfolio of tandem mass spectrometric defined epitopes eluted from MHC
of over 30 tumor samples. From this pipeline we have empirically validated both an HLA-A2 and HLA-A11
epitopes of HORMAD1, demonstrated high affinity with CTL generated using the ETC workflow and propose the
use of HORMAD1-specific CTL for this trial, allowing us to cover more than 25% of all gastric and esophageal
patients given the prevalence of HORMAD1 expression in these tumors (> 40%) and HLA allele expression (>
65%). At completion of the UG3 portion of this proposal, we will identify an optimal epigenetic program (Aim 1)
and TGFBDNR2 transduction workflow (Aim 2) that fulfills the metrics for a Go/ No-Go decision. In the clinical
trial component (UH3) these strategies will be assembled to allow us to evaluate safety and duration of in vivo
persistence, comparing HORMAD1-specific CTL and TGFBDNR2-engineered HORMAD-1-specitic CTL in two
cohorts, while assessing for preliminary efficacy in an Expansion arm.
 The ETC platform provides greater flexibility than other ACT modalities in its agility to direct specificity to
almost any desired target epitope, demonstrated evidence of antigen-spreading, minimal toxicities, and has an
established memory potential proven to be sustained in several clinical trials. We anticipate, that with an
enhanced epigenetic memory program and, endowed with a mechanism to undermine at least one feature of
tumor immune resistance, ETC therapy can provide a vehicle for advancing adoptive cellular therapy for the
treatment of solid tumors in a systematic and stepwise fashion."

Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn) is a primary causative agent of healthcare-associated infections affecting hundreds
of millions worldwide. Bloodstream Kpn infections are of particular concern as they contribute to high patient
mortality and represent a major public health burden. Kpn colonizes the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of healthy and
immunocompromised individuals. In healthy individuals, bacteria can breach the intestinal epithelial surface and
enter the circulatory system, but are rapidly cleared. In patients lacking a fully competent immune system, Kpn
can cause life-threatening systemic infections. There is an urgent need to understand the factors that control the
spread of Kpn from the GI tract to sterile sites. We developed a mouse model of naturally acquired Kpn GI
colonization to identify pathogen and host factors which regulate acquisition, carriage, and dissemination. Using
this mouse model, we found a critical role for B cells in controlling GI bacterial burden, systemic dissemination,
and mortality. In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms by which B cells regulate Kpn growth in the
GI tract, translocation, and systemic spread. In Aim 1, we will examine: a) the roles of pre-existing and Kpn-
induced (adaptive) mucosal and systemic antibody in regulating Kpn GI growth and dissemination and b) the
impact of dysbiosis in driving unchecked GI growth and dissemination in B cell-deficient mice. This work will be
complemented by an innovative technical approach in Aim 2 which will reveal bottlenecks and population
dynamics experienced by Kpn along the path from the mouth to the gut to systemic sterile sites in both wild type
and B cell-deficient mice. Here we will leverage a uniquely barcoded Kpn population in combination with high-
resolution sequencing to identify frequencies of translocation events, expansion dynamics, and the origination
of founding populations within distinct tissue sites and blood. Ultimately, this work is expected to reveal the
importance of B cells in controlling Kpn growth and dissemination at various sites within the host and the
mechanisms by which this occurs."

Cellular senescence is a tumor-suppressive cell growth arrest triggered by inducers such as stand-of-care
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) chemotherapeutic platinum, known as therapy-induced senescence.
However, senescent cells are viable and may promote therapy relapse and immune escape through the
secretion of factors such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, termed the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Thus, it would be ideal to selectively eliminate the detrimental
SASP while maintaining the senescence-associated growth arrest. Developing novel therapeutic
strategies to overcome therapy resistance remains a major obstacle to overcome in combating EOC. Thus,
the overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism underlying the SASP and leverage these
newly gained mechanistic insights to develop senescence based combinatory EOC therapeutics. cGAS
promotes the SASP through recognizing cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF) during senescence. Our
preliminary studies show that the protein Thioredoxin Reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is localized to CCF and
TXNRD1 inhibition impairs the localization of cGAS into CCF, the cGAS-STING pathway, and the SASP
during platinum-induced senescence in EOC. Notably, TXNRD1 inhibition does not affect senescence-
associated growth arrest. The objectives of this application are to investigate the signaling basis by which
TXNRD1 controls the SASP and to investigate a combination senescence based EOC therapeutic
strategy. Our central hypothesis is that TXNRD1 promotes therapy relapse and resistance through the
SASP by activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway during therapy-induced senescence in EOC.
Accordingly, two specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 is to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which
TXNRD1 regulates the SASP during senescence, and Aim 2 will determine the role of TXNRD1 in EOC
therapy response. The proposed studies are highly novel because this is the first study to explore a
molecular switch that controls the SASP by regulating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway via CCF. Thus,
our studies are paradigm-shifting in their potential to elucidate the molecular basis of SASP regulation
during senescence. The research proposed is of high impact because it will lay the critical foundation for
ultimately developing urgently novel EOC therapeutic strategies through limiting SASP-associated therapy
relapse and resistance. Therefore, the current study will not only provide critical mechanistic insights into
SASP regulation during senescence but will also have far-reaching implications for the development of
senescence-based therapeutic strategies."

There is a significant body of research into the genetic, genomic and epigenomic alterations of retinoblastoma
(RB), a primary eye cancer that forms in the developing retina in young children. However, these studies were
done on tumor tissues from surgically removed (enucleated) eyes with advanced RB, as tumor biopsy is not
possible due to the real risk of tumor extraocular dissemination. As a result, RB tumor DNA was never previously
accessible aside from these enucleated specimens, and there is limited understanding of the molecular
alterations that may drive tumor behavior. Furthermore, any application of molecular diagnostic or use of
prognostic biomarkers for personalized medicine in vivo is limited by the lack of tumor tissue at diagnosis or
during therapy. Thus, a liquid biopsy approach, which overcomes this critical lack of tumor tissue, was needed
for this disease. With support of an NCI K08, we demonstrated that the aqueous humor (AH), an intraocular fluid,
is an enriched source of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). We developed a liquid biopsy assay to detect
somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) and pathogenic variants in the RB1 tumor suppressor gene from a
single 100 l sample of AH. We identified that the genomic alterations from the AH are highly concordant (>94%)
with those found in the tumor of enucleated eyes. We identified potential candidate biomarkers, chromosome 6p
gain and/or focal MYCNa in the AH cfDNA that are associated with a 16.5-fold increased risk of treatment failure
requiring surgical removal of the eye. We demonstrated that changes in AH cfDNA tumor fraction (TFx) correlate
with treatment response, with increases in TFx indicative of recurrence or minimal residual intraocular disease.
This suggests that TFx alone may serve as a reliable real-time biomarker for treatment response. We also
demonstrated the feasibility of evaluating tumor methylation profiles using the AH, thereby facilitating a better
understanding of tumor biomarkers that may predict tumor behavior and potentially treatment response. Based
in these results, we hypothesize that AH cfDNA can be used for molecular characterization of in vivo RB tumors
to inform diagnosis and prognosis for eye salvage based on validated genomic and epigenomic biomarkers. To
test this hypothesis, we now propose a multi-center, multi-omics, prospective study to characterize prognostic
AH biomarkers prospectively and longitudinally to determine treatment outcomes.
Benefits from this study will include advancing knowledge about the course of the disease at any stage, providing
biomarkers to guide treatment, and forming the basis for future molecular-based, precision medicine clinical trials
for RB."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 6.5 million Americans inflicting tremendous burden on our society both
economically and in terms of human suffering, yet the etiology of AD is not fully understood. Risk factors for AD
are numerous and include demographic, genetic, lifestyle, medical, environmental, psychiatric, and infectious
factors. Among the infectious factors known to be associated with AD is periodontal disease (PerioD). PerioD
is a polymicrobial infection of the gingival tissue and one of the most common conditions of the oral cavity.
There is a growing interest in the connection between PerioD and AD, yet the mechanism between underlying
this association is unknown, and most studies have focused their investigation on a limited number of PerioD-
associated organisms, for example Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tanerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola.
Currently, a major and fundamental obstacle in the field is the lack of a cross-kingdom (bacterial, viral, fungal),
comprehensive characterization of the oral microbiome of PerioD as it relates to AD risk. The overall purpose
of the proposed project is to investigate the clinical relevance of the oral microbiome in individuals most at risk
for AD. 150 middle aged individuals will be enrolled in this longitudinal cohort study. The main objective is to
characterize the taxonomy and function of oral bacteria, viruses and fungi among cognitively normal individuals
at risk for AD, and over a two-year period, investigate relationships among PerioD-associated microbiome
features, inflammation, social determinants of oral health, and AD CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, total-Tau, and
phospho-Tau). We will leverage existing NIH funded, well-characterized cohorts that include racially diverse
individuals at high risk for AD (through family history or APOE4 allele). Participants will complete 3 study visits
annually. Cerebral spinal fluid for AD and inflammatory markers will be collected at baseline and Yr2. Annual
assessments and specimen collection will include: a clinical oral examination; subgingival plaque for
microbiome assessment; saliva for inflammatory markers; blood for systemic inflammatory markers;
neuropsychological testing; and surveys (medication/health history; oral symptoms, hygiene behavior, and
quality of life; social determinants of health). Finally, we will conduct semi-structured in-depth interviews to
explore the social determinant factors related to oral health and AD. Generated data will inform larger NIH
funded studies and, to our knowledge, provide the largest and most comprehensive characterization of the oral
microbiome in a racially diverse sample of individuals at risk for AD."
10791859,"This research proposal addresses a key challenge to drug development: the paucity of biomarkers that reveal
whether interventions affect implicated brain circuitry at early stages, in animals and humans, before embarking
on lengthy and expensive clinical trials. Studies of humans and rodents have established sleep spindles, defining
EEG oscillations of stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, as a mechanism of memory consolidation.
A growing body of work implicates sleep spindle abnormalities in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders characterized by memory impairment. In schizophrenia, sleep spindle deficits predict impaired sleep-
dependent memory consolidation. Findings that increasing spindles via drugs or auditory or transcranial brain
stimulation during sleep improves memory in healthy people, provides the impetus to target spindles to improve
memory in disorders. But targeting spindles does not inevitably improve memory. Complementary rodent and
human studies provide an explanation: sleep-dependent memory consolidation relies not on spindles alone, but
on their precise temporal coordination with the other two cardinal NREM sleep oscillations: cortical slow
oscillations (SOs) and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. These findings make it clear that while spindles are
promising targets for improving memory, (i) effective therapies need to increase spindles AND preserve or
enhance their coupling with SOs and ripples, and (ii) to evaluate efficacy, we need new assays to identify spindles
that couple with SOs and ripples to mediate memory versus those that do not. We propose to: (i) identify the
most powerful translational measures of sleep spindles as assays of sleep-dependent memory consolidation
(UG3), and (ii) to noninvasively manipulate them to compare their responses in healthy humans and rodents
(UH3). Using invasive recordings in epilepsy patients and local field potentials (LFPs) in rats, we will first
demonstrate that spindles that couple with both SOs and ripples (TriCS: triple-coupled spindles) are associated
with memory consolidation, thereby validating TriCS as a translational biomarker of memory. We will then use
machine learning to develop a classifier that identifies TriCS based solely on their scalp EEG features. We will
validate the EEG spindle classifier by applying it to a dataset from healthy humans to demonstrate that TriCS,
but not non-coupled spindles, correlate with memory consolidation. In both species, we will determine which
spindle assay TriCS, SO-coupled spindles (SOCS) or total spindles predicts memory best. Finally, we will
noninvasively manipulate the spindle assays in humans and rats. Genetic studies are implicating specific
pathophysiologic mechanisms of spindle deficits in schizophrenia and autism and identifying novel targets and
treatments. The rodent and human spindle assays that we will develop will facilitate the translation of these
advances to the clinic by allowing the efficient evaluation of potential interventions early in the treatment
development pipeline and the identification of the most promising candidates for clinical trials."
10875429,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare form of heart failure (HF) that occurs in women during late
pregnancy to the early postpartum period. Although PPCM incidence is increasing, the etiology of this syndrome
remains unclear and limited treatments are available. A “2-hit” mechanism— in which 1) an unrecognized genetic
predisposition for HF is unmasked by 2) a surge of deleterious circulating factors in late pregnancy—is the
leading hypothesis in PPCM. A fundamental gap in our understanding of PPCM is what the core pathobiology
driving this “2nd hit” is. Our group recently profiled the circulating proteome of women with PPCM or preeclampsia
(a major PPCM risk factor) to gain insights into their shared secretory pathophysiology. This paradoxically
identified the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a marker of biological aging, as the most
highly upregulated biological process in these young women. Our preliminary data in human cohorts and
experimental models has identified strong associations between senescence biology and cardiac dysfunction
and HF severity in PPCM, and ultimately led us to a novel hypothesis that accelerated placental senescence is
the elusive root cause of the “2nd hit” in PPCM pathophysiology. The placenta, whose lifespan is limited to ~40
weeks, can be viewed as the fastest aging organ in the human body and notably becomes markedly senescent
by late pregnancy. Our objective here is to prove causality of placental senescence in PPCM. Here we propose
three integrated Specific Aims that incorporate rigorous gain- and loss-of-function experiments to definitively
answer this question. In Aim 1, we will use parabiosis and heterotopic placental implantation to determine if the
senescent placenta secretome is sufficient to induce cardiac dysfunction in PPCM-prone mice. In Aim 2, we will
incorporate pharmacological and genetic senolytic approaches to determine if placental senescence is
necessary in PPCM pathophysiology. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will systematically identify novel placenta-derived
senescence-associated secretory factors that induce pathologic cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, independent of
hemodynamic effects. This will integrate comprehensive functional, structural, and metabolic phenotyping with
proteomic and RNAseq profling in an ex vivo model system of human cardiomyocyte-placental crosstalk. Our
approach combines innovative hypotheses, state-of-the-art technology, and unique experimental strategies. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide important new mechanistic insights into this
poorly understood HF syndrome that could fundamentally change the framework by which we approach cardiac
remodeling in pregnancy. The translational potential of this work is highlighted by our focus on secretory proteins
that can be targeted for therapeutic development, and could potentially be relevant to a broader spectrum of HF
syndromes associated with senescence (e.g. aging, cancer). Given our group’s expertise in aging biology,
cardiovascular physiology, and experimental models of HF, along with the expertise of our collaborators in
PPCM, preeclampsia, and human genomics, we are well equipped to complete the proposed research study."

During terminal erythropoiesis, erythroid cells produce significant quantities of heme and heme intermediates
which must be coupled to hemoglobin production and iron uptake. Dysregulation of heme synthesis can cause
toxic accumulation of heme intermediates and heme deficiency, leading to diseases such as iron overload,
anemia and porphyria. We have demonstrated that mitochondrial CLPX, a member of the ubiquitious AAA+
(ATPases associated with various cellular activities) protein unfoldases family, plays a key role in erythroid
differentiation by direct regulation of heme synthesis. CLPX functions as a ring-shaped homo-hexamer and is
best understood for its function in a proteasome-like enzyme complex with the peptidase CLPP (the CLPXP
ATP-dependent protease). In erythroid cells, CLPX is essential for heme synthesis by regulating the terminal
steps of porphyrin synthesis and mitochondrial iron metabolism. This finding is conceptually significant as
ALA synthesis has until now been understood to be the rate limiting step of porphyrin synthesis. In addition,
although the heme synthesis and iron metabolism pathways are coregulated, the mechanisms by which this
occurs are poorly understood. This proposal tests the conceptually innovative hypothesis that CLPX
coordinates the terminal steps of the heme synthesis pathway with mitochondrial iron metabolism and is a key
regulatory node for coupling heme synthesis and iron metabolism to the needs of the erythroid cell. The goal of
this proposal is to identify the mechanisms by which CLPX regulates erythoid heme synthesis and
erythropoiesis. This will be accomplished by Specific Aim 1, which examines the novel mechanisms by which
CLPX regulates the terminal enzymes of the heme synthesis pathway, PPOX and FECH. Specific Aim 2 will
identify the mechanisms by which CLPX regulates mitochondrial iron metabolism and the role of iron status in
modulating diseases caused by mutations in the CLPX gene. Completion of these specific aims will
fundamentally inform our understanding of “housekeeping” proteins like CLPX can have tissue specific
functions in erythroid cells. These findings are also of translational significance as they will enable us to
determine how to manipulate iron status to treat specific types of iron/heme disorders."

Our overarching aim is to address the critical need for robust computational methods and tools for mass
spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics data. Here, we are focusing on three key areas of biological research: 1)
MS-based characterization of “interactomes”, i.e., analysis of protein-protein interaction networks and complexes
using affinity purification – mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and related technologies. 2) Post-translational
modifications (PTMs), which have a profound effect on a myriad of cellular process, including how proteins
interact with other proteins and assemble into multi-functional complexes. 3) Single-cell proteomics that is critical
for obtaining more complete (in addition to single-cell transcriptomics) insights into cellular heterogeneity.
Furthermore, in recent years the field of proteomics has witness tremendous advances in MS technologies and
sample preparation protocols, including addition of the trapped ion mobility separation (TIMS) dimension to time-
of-flight MS (timsTOF technology), new fragmentation mechanisms, new chemical labeling strategies, and
improved multiplex quantitative technologies. Under this grant, we have developed the Statistical Analysis of
Interactomes (SAINT) framework which, together with the Contaminant Repository for Affinity Purification
(CRAPome), formed the basis for a widely used Resource for Evaluation of PRotein INTeractions (REPRINT).
Our DIA-Umpire and IonQuant algorithms have advanced the field of label-free protein quantification. The novel
indexing algorithm of MSFragger has led to a 100-fold increase in the computational speed of peptide
identification from MS spectra, enabling the new “open search” and “mass offset” strategies for comprehensive
identification of PTMs. We will continue our innovative work by developing new functionalities and algorithms in
our interactome analysis resources, including transitioning REPRINT to our new MSFragger-based pipeline,
further expansion of the CRAPome repository of non-specific background proteins, and improved interactome
scoring. Leveraging our recent computational advances, we will develop novel tools to identify PTMs in large-
scale MS-based interactome data, and search for PTMs that correlate with changes in the interactomes across
different conditions. Building on our new localization-aware open search algorithm of MSFragger, we will develop
new algorithms for comprehensive PTM profiling and chemical proteomics. Furthermore, working closely with
the leaders in the field, we will develop new algorithms, tools, and benchmarking strategies for the analysis of
MS-based single-cell proteomics data. We will continue providing our widely used computational tools and data
resources to the biological community."

 Kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is one of the 10 most common cancers in
the US. In 2022, over 79,000 people will be diagnosed with RCC. Localized renal masses (LRM,
tumors confined to the kidney) make up two-thirds of all RCC. Patients found to have a LRM face
many choices on what to do, especially since it is not uncommon for these LRM to be benign.
There are currently four ways to manage LRM – active surveillance (watching the mass but not
treating it), thermal ablation (heating the mass by putting a needle in it from the outside), partial
nephrectomy (surgery to cut the mass out but leave the rest of the kidney in place), and radical
nephrectomy (surgery to remove the entire kidney). Patients and doctors are often confused as
to which option to pursue since there have been few previous studies to guide them. It is currently
recommended that the kidney be preserved in patients who may have future problems with their
kidney function. However, it is hard to identify these patients, especially when they have other
health issues. Current recommendations are based on “expert opinion” and it is typically left up
to the doctor to decide what is best for the patient in terms of risk to the kidney and whether the
cancer threatens the life of the patient over other medical conditions the patient may have.
 The primary goal of our study is to identify specific management plans that can be
individualized for a patient with a LRM. This will make it easier for the doctor and patient to decide
on the best way to manage the mass. By using a tool built with real-world information, the “trade-
off” with each option (like kidney function) will be clearer to the patient, thereby helping them make
the best decision. We will create an internet-based database shared between three different major
academic hospitals. We will collect information about the health of the patient, how good their
kidney function is, and the details of the LRM. We will assess how often biopsies are done prior
to treatment of the LRM and what treatments patients tend to pursue. We will develop a set of
rules for management of a LRM using a Markov decision process model and real-world patient
information. We will then use this model to identify treatment decisions that are in line with patient-
driven goals, including what is best for their quality of life, and approaches that minimize health
care cost. Our work will enable patients and their doctors to participate in a shared-decision
making process. We will create a web-based tool and assess the feasibility of community
urologists helping with gathering patient information and collaboration to optimize patient
management (i.e., community versus academic setting)."

While considerable evidence is available for screening and early treatment of breast and cervical cancers,
huge gaps remain in equitable and sustainable translation of this knowledge into practice and policy, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa. In Kenya, gaps in screening and linkage to treatment result in late-stage presentation of
breast and cervical cancers, profound preventable morbidity and mortality, and disproportionate hindrance to
women’s development. To close these gaps, the Enhanced BReast and cErvical cAncer screening in Kenya
THROUGH implementation science research and training (BREAKTHROUGH) Center coalesces trans-
disciplinary expertise at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), Emory University, University of Washington, and
Queen’s University. BREAKTHROUGH will include an Administrative and Engagement Core that engages
community, clinical, and government stakeholders and scientific partners, and seamlessly coordinates [Overall
Aim 1] our interrelated Research Capacity Building Core and two Research Projects. Our multi-institutional,
collaborative partners bring considerable breadth and depth of implementation science and oncology expertise,
a substantial research base, matched resource commitments (>$125,000 in contributions), international
gravitas, and >10 years of working together. To grow implementation science in women’s cancer control and
conduct impactful research, BREAKTHROUGH has a training framework that engages investigators across the
career spectrum (faculty, fellows, students) to sustainably strengthen capacity by supporting trainees to
become mentors [Overall Aim 2]. We provide didactic training; engagement in Research Projects; and access
to stakeholders, technologies, networking, and enrichment activities. BREAKTHROUGH’s projects will map
and co-design (with stakeholders) strategies that overcome barriers to women’s cancer control. We then test
feasibility, implementation, effectiveness, and sustainment of context-specific, theoretically-informed strategies
for overcoming complex barriers to adoption and integration of breast and cervical cancer screening and
referral linkages in primary care [center theme; Overall Aim 3]. We also utilize these projects as training
platforms to strengthen local capacity and research administration for implementation science at KNH. Project
1 is entitled “accelerating aDoption of pAtient-centereD cervicAl cancer screening and treatment LINKage in

10737635,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Kidney failure is a life-threatening condition that disproportionately impacts the most socially disadvantaged
communities in the US. Approximately 88% of patients with kidney failure initiate hemodialysis treatment,
where in-center care typically requires thrice-weekly treatments lasting 3-4 hours. Alternatives to in-center
hemodialysis include kidney transplantation, which is associated with lower mortality and improved quality of
life, and home dialysis, which has comparable outcomes to hemodialysis but is associated with lower costs
and offers greater flexibility and independence for patients. But these treatments are substantially underused,
and persistent racial disparities have been documented in receipt of home dialysis and in all steps leading to
transplantation. In January 2021, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) initiated the End-
stage Renal Disease Treatment Choices (ETC) Model. This mandatory model – the first of its kind – randomly
assigned dialysis facilities and managing clinicians in 30% of the US to receive financial incentives to increase
rates of home dialysis and kidney transplantation. Some observational studies suggest that payment incentives
may increase home dialysis, but causal evidence is lacking, and the impact of payment reforms on equity in
kidney failure treatments remains unclear. More broadly, CMS and other payers have advanced value-based
payment policies to improve quality of care, but evaluations of these strategies have been hampered by the
absence of appropriate control groups, often due to uniform policy implementation across the U.S. Further,
value-based payments may inadvertently lead to increasing disparities in access to care if safety-net and
minority-serving providers have fewer resources to respond to performance incentives, or if performance
measures fail to account for patients' social risk. This proposal will test the hypothesis that although the ETC
Model will increase home dialysis and referral/evaluation for transplantation, it will also widen disparities in
these outcomes because facilities that disproportionately serve minority and socially disadvantaged patients
will make lower performance gains and will be more likely to receive financial penalties. Our specific aims are:
1. Examine the impact of the ETC Model on the use of home dialysis and racial/ethnic and socioeconomic
disparities in home dialysis, 2. Identify the effects of the ETC Model on disparities in access to kidney
transplantation and 3. Examine consequences of the ETC Model for dialysis facilities according to their
patients' social risk. The proposal is innovative, as we leverage an unprecedented randomized payment reform
to estimate causal effects of financial incentives on disparities for a high-cost, high-need population. We will
derive neighborhood disadvantage by geocoding patient addresses and maximize the comprehensiveness of
our evaluation by including patients who lack traditional Medicare coverage. Thus, this work will provide
rigorous, causal evidence about the health equity implications of one of the largest randomized tests of
payment reform ever conducted in the U.S."

Research on the gut microbiome as a target for disease prevention and therapy is an intriguing arena for public
health because microbes and their metabolites are modifiable. Observational studies, murine models and a
few trials in humans suggest dietary factors exert many of their health effects in the host through modification
of the gut microbiome and its associated metabolome. Moreover, early evidence indicates the microbiome and
metabolome modify the effects of diet interventions on health outcomes, suggesting the microbiome and
metabolome have a role in precision nutrition. However, rigorously controlled feeding trials in humans are still
needed to determine the effects of whole diet inverventions on the microbiome and metabolome, and to test if
the microbiome and metabolome modify or mediate the effects of diet on cardiovascular risk factors, including
blood pressure. Of particular interest are the effects of dietary patterns and level of sodium (Na+) intake.
The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of the American Heart Association recommended
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (compared to a typical U.S. diet) and lower dietary Na+
intake vs. higher dietary Na+ intake on the gut microbiome and the untargeted and targeted metabolome—
including short chain fatty acids—in a multi-racial cohort of adults with type 2 diabetes enrolled in the DASH4D
trial – a recently funded randomized, cross-over, isocaloric controlled feeding trial. A secondary objective is to
explore if the gut microbiota and their metabolites modify and/or mediate the effects of diet patterns and Na+ on
blood pressure, thusly informing precision nutrition. We will also examine if effects vary by sex. In particular,
we propose to perform whole genome shotgun metagenomics, high-throughput metabolomics profiling, and
targeted quantification of short chain fatty acid metabolites. We will jointly investigate the microbiome and
metabolome measured in stool and blood collected before and after each of the diet periods in the feeding trial.
Dr. Mueller (PI) will carry out this research with an outstanding group of interdisciplinary co-investigators in the
collaborative and eminent environments of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and
Clinical Research and the Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Mueller’s co-investigators have
complementary expertise in feeding trials (Appel), -omic statistics (Zhao), bioinformatics (Debelius, Bittinger),
metabolomics (Rebholz), and short chain fatty acids (Pluznick). With the support of Dr. Mueller’s research
team, he is well positioned to complete the proposed activities. The findings have great potential to: (a) identify
objective measures of adherence to the DASH diet and lower dietary Na+ intake; (b) reveal novel mechanisms
underlying the BP effects of dietary patterns and Na+ intake; (c) offer new disease prevention strategies and
therapeutic possibilities and; (d) inform use of the microbiome-metabolome nexus for precision nutrition."

Itch is a global health problem, affecting tens of millions of people. The brain plays a crucial role in itch
perception; thus the specific circuit for itch processing in the brain has the potential to become a therapeutic
target for itch in a wide range of pruritic diseases. Our understanding about the brain mechanism of itch has
advanced in the past decades. Previous studies identified a key brain circuit related to itch, which includes the
ascending pathway projecting from the thalamus to the posterior insular cortex (pIC) and networks originating
from the pIC. In addition, dopamine was found to be a key neurotransmitter associated with itch. These
achievements have also identified two important topics that must be understood to develop effective itch
treatment targeting the brain. First, the brain circuit of itch is similar to that of pain, though itch and pain are
clearly distinct sensations. An itch-specific ascending pathway and network have not yet been identified within
the circuit (an itch-specific circuit). Second, there could be dopaminergic gene polymorphisms that determine
individual differences in itch perception. If such polymorphisms are identified, brain imaging studies focusing on
these genes can identify key loci regulating itch perception within the itch-specific circuit. This line of work will
eventually enable us to develop brain-based, tailored itch treatment. To this end, it is crucial to identify an itch-
specific circuit and dopaminergic gene polymorphisms influencing individual differences in itch perception. Our
research proposal will address this significant gap. Aims 1 and 2 will use fMRI to determine an itch-specific
ascending pathway and network by comparing brain activity between itch and pain stimuli. Aim 3 will use our
novel method for quantitatively assessing genetic impacts on itch to identify dopaminergic gene polymorphisms
that influence individual differences in itch perception. Success of our project will eventually lead to the
development of brain-based tailored itch treatment, which will advance the treatment of chronic itch regardless
of the underlying etiology."

 RNA polymerase (Pol) III synthesizes abundant non-coding RNAs such as tRNA, 5S rRNA, U6 snRNA
and 7SL RNA that are involved in essential cellular processes including protein synthesis, RNA processing and
protein secretion. Despite the essential roles of these RNAs in all eukaryotic cells, mutations in Pol III can have
remarkably selective effects on the central nervous system (CNS) as demonstrated by patients with Pol III-
related leukodystrophy. Mutations causing this autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease have been
identified in five different Pol III subunits with disease onset occurring most often in early childhood. Pol III-
related leukodystrophy is typically a hypomyelinating disorder although patients present with a range of both
neurological and non-neurological deficits. Neurological deficits typically include developmental delay with a
progressive decline in cognitive and motor function, ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. Non-neurological deficits
may include hypodontia, myopia and endocrine abnormalities. An understanding of the disease mechanisms
underlying these clinical characteristics is currently lacking and treatments are limited to palliative care. A
significant barrier to progress on both these fronts has been the absence of an animal model of the disease.
However, recent work has resulted in a mouse model of Pol III-related leukodystrophy that recapitulates a
subset of clinical features. Conditional knock-in of pathogenic mutations in Polr3a, which encodes the largest
Pol III subunit, specifically in Olig2-expressing cells in the CNS, leads to reduce growth, neurobehavioral
deficits and hypomyelination in multiple regions of the brain and spinal cord. Moreover, electron microscopy
along with an analysis of oligodendrocyte cell populations and specific protein markers has identified two
distinct mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis: Defective differentiation of oligodendrocyte
precursor cells (OPCs) and defective function of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs). Nevertheless, the molecular
mechanisms of pathogenesis remain poorly characterized. To advance understanding in this regard, the long-
term goals of this work are to determine how the Pol III transcriptome has been altered in OPCs and OLs in the
mutant mice and to examine the consequences of these changes for protein synthesis and for the proteome of
OPCs and OLs and the lipidome of myelin. Additionally, we will test a model for genetic suppression of Pol III-
related leukodystrophy phenotypes in the mice. Together, these studies will inform how decreasing Pol III
transcription interferes with oligodendrogenesis and myelination, yielding important mechanistic insights, and a
potential therapeutic approach that may benefit patients with Pol III-related leukodystrophy."
10792961,"Schwann cell extends its cell membrane to wrap around segments of axon concentrically for multiple layers
and forms the myelin. Demyelination removes segments of myelin along the nerve fibers. This pathology occurs
in a group of neurological disorders with collectively high prevalence: Guillain-Barre syndrome, chronic
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, hereditary neuropathy with liability
to pressure palsies (HNPP) and multiple sclerosis. Myelin may be abnormally developed (dysmyelination) in
inherited neurological diseases. Therefore, it is highly desirable if molecular targets can be identified and
manipulated to repair myelin. Motivated by our recent observations, we propose this study to deals with myelin
junction proteins and p21 activated kinase (PAK)-related pathway that likely become the molecular target.
 Our studies have discovered that hyperactive p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1) plays a key role in removal of
myelin junctions in matured myelin. These junctions are made by proteins that seal the small spaces between
layers of myelin. Removal of myelin junctions lead to excessively permeable myelin in a mouse with a deletion
of one of two copies of Pmp22 genes (Pmp22+/-), an authentic model for HNPP. The junction removal is an
early event upstream to the segmental demyelination. In contrast, we recently observed that deficiency of
PAK2 (another family member of PAK in the peripheral nerves) in Schwann cells results in severe
dysmyelination with pathological changes similar to that seen in patients with congenital hypomyelination,
suggesting a critical function of PAK2 in myelin development. Thus, relative levels of PAK1/PAK2 activation
may differentially affect myelin development and maintenance.
 In this study, we will first verify the causal relationship between hyperactive PAK1 and removal of myelin
junctions / demyelination in several peripheral neuropathy mouse models. We will then examine how PAK2
regulates myelin development. Finally, we will test whether PAK can be targeted to treat other peripheral nerve
diseases.

Leptospirosis is a common zoonotic disease most prevalent in the tropics (Hawaii, US territories, and worldwide).
Non-specific symptoms cause underreporting and of the 1.03 million reported cases annual worldwide, ~6% die.
Infectious Leptospira bacteria contaminate the environment when shed in urine from mammalian hosts, and
humans can contract leptospirosis directly from infected urine or from contaminated soil and water. While case
interviews have identified risk factors for human infections and potential reservoirs, the few molecular and
microbiological investigations of human cases almost always failed to confirm hypothesized sources, suggesting
that exposure and possible sources have not been adequately defined and environmental cycling across hosts,
space, and time is poorly understood. The complex ecology of this disease involves various host species, survival
in the environment, massive pathogen genetic diversity, and seasonal variation in human cases, all of which are
poorly characterized and poorly understood. Difficulties in culturing Leptospira have restricted the use of modern
molecular tools that, for other pathogens, have been critical for understanding cycling and confirming or refuting
source hypotheses generated using traditional epidemiological approaches. However, we recently developed a
culture-free method for high-resolution genotyping of Leptospira, enabling us to characterize cycling patterns
across hosts, space, and time, and provide high-quality evidence linking infections to specific sources.
For this study, we focus on peridomestic environments (where animals live near human habitations) because
they are likely an important, underestimated, and poorly understood source for human infections in rural areas.
Our field site is in Calderon Parish in Manabí, where leptospirosis cases are most prevalent in Ecuador.
Compared to urban areas where leptospirosis is typically studied, low-income rural areas are fundamentally
different: families typically own a variety of animals and livestock that roam in and around homes creating
exposure potential that is largely absent from urban environments. We will systematically sample peridomestic
environments (humans, other animals, and soil) to characterize variation in prevalence, pathogen load, and
genotype across hosts, time, and space. We will also recruit leptospirosis patients to perform microbiological
and molecular investigations of their peridomestic environment to determine what, if any, peridomestic reservoirs
are likely sources for these human infections.
This study will provide novel insights into the prevalence and cycling of this pathogen in hosts and soil in the
peridomestic environment and each investigation will generate novel and powerful molecular and microbiological
evidence to exclude or confirm the peridomestic environment as the source of each human infection.
Comparisons across these investigations will provide insights into how widespread such sources are in this
region of Ecuador and will form the basis for future investigations to determine the generalizability of these
patterns. Results will fill massive knowledge gaps critical for transmission control and disease prevention."

Every day, 1900 children die from an injury. More than 95% of these pediatric injury deaths occur in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs), with children in sub-Saharan Africa disproportionately affected. In sub-
Saharan Africa, pediatric morbidity and mortality could be minimized if children with serious injuries received
timely quality care. The objective of the proposed research is to develop and pilot a locally-relevant,
multicomponent intervention to streamline the triage process (e.g. patient assessment, stabilization, and
disposition) for pediatric injury patients in Tanzania. This health systems intervention will work at the first level
of medical contact (e.g., health center and district hospital), in order to facilitate timely disposition and referrals,

Age-dependent changes in Drosophila represent the key Hallmarks of Aging. While the progression of these
Hallmarks is delayed by intervention within the nutrient sensing axis, there is no consensus for how nutrient
sensing mechanistically coordinates Hallmarks or how retarded Hallmarks coordinate to regulate lifespan. We
will address this issue with new genotypes of the Drosophila insulin/IGF receptor (dInr) that differentially affect
nutrient sensing where each extends lifespan. Canonical long-lived dInr mutants are insulin-resistant.
Remarkably, a new dInr mutation within the kinase insert domain (KID) strongly increases lifespan but retains
insulin sensitivity. We conducted RNA, metabolomic and methionine-isotope labeling analyses to gain insight
on how nutrient sensing regulates aging hallmarks. We found insulin-resistant dInr increases cellular methionine
cycle flux, whereas insulin-sensitive dInr decreases this flux. Notably, the methionine cycle is a control hub for
epigenetics, proteostasis, stress resistance, and stem cell regulation – underlying processes of aging hallmarks.
We therefore hypothesize the methionine cycle provides a central mechanism to control multiple Hallmarks of
Aging in response to nutrient sensing. This proposal will establish how nutrient regulation of the methionine cycle
integrates Hallmarks of Aging."
10884306,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Addictive drugs usurp the normal neural machinery for learning and memory to generate pathological cognition
that can lead to compulsive drug usage. One prominent example is re-exposure to a drug-associated
environmental context, which robustly induces drug relapse in both humans and animal models. The
hippocampal formation, which is critical for spatial and contextual learning, is well positioned to support the
encoding of this type of drug-context association. Despite decades of hippocampal studies on drug-evoked
molecular and cellular adaptations and drug-seeking behaviors, we still lack a clear understanding of which
hippocampal circuits are involved in acquiring and maintaining maladapted drug-context associations and how
neural dynamics in the hippocampus are transformed to support drug-seeking behavior. Moreover, there are no
interventions that specifically target the drug-associated memories to treat substance use disorders. Here, with
the proposed training in computational modeling for neural dynamics and the development of advanced genetic
and imaging tools, I aim to fill these knowledge gaps by elucidating the neural circuit mechanisms in the
hippocampus for drug-context associations and probing whether we can reverse this association using a
memory-based intervention. Preliminary data suggest opioid reward vs. withdrawal-mediated associative
learning have distinct effects on representing different spatial variables in CA1 neurons and ketamine was able
to reset the maladapted contextual representation to disrupt the retrieval of drug-associated memories. For Aim
1, I will investigate how drug-associated information alters the neural coding in the hippocampus for multiple
spatial variables that are critical for the perception of a given context. Using miniscope imaging in morphine
conditioned place preference/aversion, I will learn to build linear-nonlinear Poisson (LNP) models to reveal how
drug-context associations under positive vs. negative reinforcement affect the neural coding of CA1 for position,
head orientation, running speed and their conjunctions. For Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that Ketamine
disrupts learned drug-context associations by restoring the maladapted representations of functional cell types
(e.g., place cells) to their normal state. I will acquire expertise on opioid withdrawal and investigate ketamine’s
effect on withdrawal-context associations by targeting memory reconsolidation and reveal the corresponding
change in neural dynamics of CA1. For Aim 3, I will elucidate neural circuit assembly and dynamics for coding
drug-associated contextual information in the subiculum, a major downstream target of the hippocampal CA1.
This study will leverage my training in Aim 1 and 2 to advance our understanding of the principles for processing
drug-associated information in the brain. Together, the proposed training and studies will not only help me to
establish an independent research program but also provide a mechanistic understanding of how hippocampal
neurons encode and represent drug-associated contextual information and shed light on developing novel
therapeutic treatments for substance use disorders."

 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affects millions of people around the world. Recently, stem cell gene therapy has
emerged as a potentially curative option for SCD. Obtaining a sufficient dose of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) from peripheral blood is paramount to the success of these gene therapies. However,
the higher numbers of RBCs in apheresis products can adversely impact the yield of valuable hematopoietic
stem cells during purification (~46% loss). There is, therefore, an immediate unmet need to develop an isolation
technology that can efficiently recover hematopoietic stem cells from apheresis products, irrespective of their
hematocrits. To address this challenge, I will develop a microfluidic HSPC isolation chip (HSPC-iChip) capable
of recovering >95% CD34+ cells from full apheresis products (~300 mL) in an hour (Aim 1). I will bring
advancements (in microfluidic technologies) from the field of cancer diagnostics to the field of
hematology to accomplish this. My central hypothesis is that the HSPC-iChip can isolate highly viable and
functional hematopoietic stem cells. To test this hypothesis, I will genetically edit the isolated stem cells and
analyze engraftment, disease correction, and human hematopoiesis in NBSGW mice (Aim 1). Additionally, under
the influence of centrifugal forces, the hypercoagulable state of sickle cell patients can lead to the formation of
cell clusters. These clusters have been observed to destabilize the cell collection interface, requiring highly
skilled apheresis operators for stem cell collection from sickle cell patients. Once the apheresis product is
collected, subsequent purification of ~1% HSPCs from the rest of the cells further necessitates specialized
instruments and consumables. This restricts a broader implementation of sickle cell gene therapy as most
patients reside in low-resource settings where skilled labor, bio-cleanrooms, and financial capabilities
are restricted. To address this challenge, in Aim 2, I will test the feasibility of a Precision Apheresis
technology that can directly separate HSPCs from peripheral circulation in a single step based on their
surface epitopes (CD34). The training objective of this project is to provide Dr. Mishra—who has a strong
background in microfluidics and cell sorting—with additional scientific training from leading pioneers in
therapeutic gene editing for hemoglobinopathies (Dr. Bauer, Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard), stem cell
apheresis and pathology (Dr. Manis, Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard), clinical hematology (Dr. Azar,
MGH/Harvard) high-throughput microfluidics (Dr. Toner, lead mentor, MGH/Harvard), animal models and
advanced tissue culture (Dr. Haber, co-mentor, MGH/Harvard), nanoparticle kinetics (Dr. Bhatia, MIT),
computational modeling of blood cells (Dr. Koumoutsakos, Harvard), and closed-loop mouse-chip models (Dr.
Manalis, MIT). This additional training will prepare Dr. Mishra to lead an independent transdisciplinary research
program in hematology, sickle cell disease, and bioengineering."

Alzheimer disease (AD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder which varies in presentation within and across
diverse communities and backgrounds. Neuroanatomically, heterogeneity is observed in the topographical
patterns of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) markers used to stage AD. For example, patterns
of tau accumulation and brain atrophy are highly correlated and have been subtyped by advanced multivariate
and machine learning methods into those involving typical AD regions (e.g., medial-temporal, lateral
temporoparietal), hippocampal-sparing, limbic-predominant regions or minimal atrophy, while amyloid
accumulation can be subtyped into frontal, parietal, and occipital regions. Notably, spatial subtypes are
associated with distinct cognitive, genetic (e.g., APOE e4 genotype), and fluid biomarker profiles, thus
suggesting that clinical heterogeneity may in part stem from neuroanatomical heterogeneity. Although
neuroanatomical heterogeneity in AD has important implications for cognitive and functional outcomes as well
as patient-specific treatments, there is a large gap in the literature regarding AD biomarker topographical
patterns in ethno-racial groups. Similarly, it is largely unknown to what extent structural and social
determinants of health (SSDOH) affect heterogeneity. The present study fills a critical gap in the literature by
including under-represented minorities and relevant SSDOH factors in the investigation of heterogeneity in
AT(N) imaging markers.
Using data from the racially and ethnically diverse Health and Aging Brain Study –
Health Disparities (HABS-HD), this study will
A) determine AD heterogeneity profiles (i.e., spatial subtypes and
magnitude) for A, T, and N neuroimaging markers (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], amyloid and tau
positron emission tomography [PET]) using a machine learning approach; B) assess within and between group
differences in heterogeneity profiles across Mexican-Americans, Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW); and
C) assess overall effects of SSDOH (e.g., area deprivation index, acculturation, education etc.) on A, T, and N
heterogeneity profiles within and between ethno-racial groups. Biomarker cut-points and group-level
composites used to classify individuals in research and clinical settings are often informed through the
identification of AD-specific or AD-vulnerable brain regions. However, the identified AD-sensitive regions and
associated cut-points are typically derived from one group (i.e., NHWs) and applied to all. Characterizing
heterogeneity in AT(N) imaging markers using a diverse and representative sample is therefore crucial to
informing whether AD-sensitive regions are similar across individuals and thus whether current cut-points are
appropriate."

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease with a five-year survival of only 10%. The rise of
immunotherapy has led to breakthrough treatments in many cancers, like melanoma, drastically improving
survival outcomes. However, unlike malignant melanoma, we have seen minimal changes in survival for
pancreatic cancer because we still do not completely understand the regulators of immunity in this disease.
Bacterial dysbiosis is emerging as an accomplice to carcinogenesis and is associated with pancreatic
cancer progression and poorer survival. We found that gut bacteria can directly access the pancreas, and
pancreatic tumors harbor a unique microbiome. The tumor-associated microbiome regulates pancreatic
cancer progression by skewing tumor-infiltrating immune cells towards an immunosuppressive phenotype.
However, the exact mechanisms via which bacteria regulate immune cell function is still unknown.
Inflammatory signaling in cancer cells and stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to
greatly regulate the immune cell infiltrate in pancreatic cancer. Our preliminary data suggests that
pathogenic bacteria can directly interact with pancreatic epithelial cells inducing proliferation and an
inflammatory response. Furthermore, we found that the presence of bacteria in tumors skews fibroblast
differentiation towards an inflammatory, tumor-promoting phenotype. In this proposal, we seek to
determine how tumor-associated bacteria modulate the epithelial and stromal compartments in the
pancreatic tumor microenvironment thereby aiding their ability to promote pancreatic cancer progression.
The overall goal of this application is to support my continued training and development to become an
independent investigator in microbiology and pancreas cancer biology. The career development plan is
based on formal didactic coursework, experiential learning, and mentored basic science training. I have
received generous support and protected time from my department and will work closely with my mentor
Dr. Marina Pasca di Magliano, PhD a respected and experienced pancreatic cancer biologist. I have also
constructed an advisory committee, with expertise in microbiology and bacteria-host interaction to further
my microbiology training while completing this project. The major themes of my research interests are
reflected in the Specific Aims of this proposal: (1) to determine the influence of tumor-associated bacteria
on pancreatic cancer cells (2) to determine their ability to activate and differentiate pancreatic stromal cells
and (3) to further characterize the mechanisms of pathogenicity unique to pancreatic cancer-associated
bacteria. Successful completion of these proposed experiments will delineate the mechanisms via which
microbes interface with non-immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, and provide insight into
therapeutic strategies for gut microbial modulation in treating pancreatic cancer."
10888374,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the only cause of death in
the top ten that cannot be effectively prevented, treated, or cured. Recent evidence suggests that AD may be
linked to fungal brain infections. To rigorously study this possibility, we established a model of cerebral mycosis
by intravenously (IV) injecting the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, which transits the blood brain barrier to
establish a parenchymal brain infection. The resulting cerebral mycosis induces mild memory deficits and fungal
induced glial granulomas (FIGGs) consisting of microglial aggregates, amyloid β (aβ) deposits, and amyloid
precursor protein (APP) surrounding yeast aggregates. This structure essentially duplicates AD’s characteristic
senile plaques, but the cerebral mycosis and memory loss are transient, not persisting beyond 10 days after a
single intravenous infection. In contrast, AD involves numerous senile plaques and tauopathy that presumably
accrue over many years in the setting of chronic cerebral mycosis that is linked to progressive, irreversible
dementia. This raises the key possibility that C. albicans might persist in a remote tissue site, such as the
intestines, from which it might periodically mobilize to chronically re-infect the brain. As both C. albicans
colonization of the GI tract and low-level candidemia deriving from the GI tract have been documented in
humans, we hypothesize that chronic C. albicans enteritis leads to low-level transmission of fungal cells into the
bloodstream and persistent cerebral mycosis. To test this hypothesis and establish a more translationally
relevant chronic model, we administered yeast from C. albicans to wildtype C57BL/6 mice via oral gavage. We
found that live yeast are recoverable from the brain as soon as 2 days post gavage and out to at least day 58
and this persistence is altered in human APOE4 transgene mice, which express the human allele of APOE that
is linked to two-thirds of AD cases. Additionally, these colonies were polymicrobial, consisting of both yeast and
bacteria, an observation that is consistent with recent published analysis and our own cultures of AD brains that
demonstrate polymicrobial brain infections involving both fungi and bacteria. Consistent with our previous IV
model, chronically infected WT mice present with elevated brain aβ 1-40 and 1-42 and both genotypes present
with abnormal behavior. To further determine the potential of this model as a translational model for AD, we
propose the following aims: (1) to determine the histopathological and physiological brain response to
polymicrobial infection, (2) To determine the mechanism of metastasis of gut fungi and bacteria to the brain, (3)
to determine effect of gastric inflammation on metastasis of gut fungi and bacteria to the brain. Through this
study we will establish if this infection produces an AD phenotype, how this infection invades the brain and
persists in the host, and the immune mechanisms involved in fungal clearance. This research is groundbreaking
for the AD field, suggesting the use antifungals as treatment and prevention for AD, elucidating novel
neuroimmune mechanisms, and producing an unprecedented model for AD therapeutic and mechanistic studies."
10869991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Studies of the thymic microenvironment have focused largely on the central role of thymic epithelial cells (TECs)
during development, disease and aging. However recent evidence suggests that the thymic vascular
compartment also plays an active and complex role within the thymus beyond that of a simple conduit for
hematopoietic cells. This role is particularly evident during the neonatal period when robust thymopoiesis is
accompanied by a profound though transient phase of angiogenesis, followed by rapid maturation of TECs. This
research proposal builds on the recent and novel finding that the vasculature of the neonatal thymus is in fact
dominated by lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) rather than blood endothelial cells (BECs), the latter becoming
dominant by early adulthood. The application of classical LEC-associated cell surface markers is problematic in
the thymus in which these markers are either undetectable or expressed on other cell types. The few reports
describing the existence of lymphatics in the thymus have studied the adult organ in which LECs are very rare.
As a result, the existence of the lymphatic compartment of the thymus has remained largely ignored and the
function of LECs and the vasculature they form is unknown. The recent development of key technical advances
now allows us to explore this poorly understood cellular compartment of the thymus. Reliable mouse models
developed to study LECs in other organs, will now be applied for the first time to identify and manipulate LECs
in the thymus. Single cell transcriptomics, including spatial gene expression and proteomics, will allow the
detailed simultaneous analysis of LECs, BECs and the other compartments of the thymus during development
and after in vivo perturbation of LECs. By combining these powerful technologies, we will test the hypothesis
that the lymphatic vasculature of the neonatal period plays a critical role in both the remodeling and maturation
of the murine thymic architecture and the differentiation and egress of T cells during the same period. The
transcriptional signature of thymic LECs so developed in the mouse will allow direct comparative transcriptional
studies of the LECs in the human thymus that would be impossible by standard assays. Specifically, we aim to:
1. Define the lymphatic compartment of the thymus during development at the cellular and transcriptional level
2. Determine if inhibition of lymphangiogenesis affects development of the thymic microenvironment
3. Define the role of lymphangiogenesis in T cell differentiation and egress from the developing thymus
In summary we will use the unique window of the murine neonatal period to define the factors that control the
growth and regression of the lymphatic endothelium in the thymus, as well as the role of LECs in the dramatic
concurrent changes seen in the other thymic compartments. The ultimate goal of these studies is to uncover
novel pathways that may be explored for enhancing thymic function and regeneration to improve immunity and
health."

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common lung cancer subtype diagnosed in the US; characterized by
a broad spectrum of biological behaviors and clinical trajectories. Yet, LUAD is managed uniformly based on
clinical stage, with the potential for under- and over-treatment of aggressive and indolent lesions, respectively.
This contributes both to suboptimal lung cancer outcomes and unnecessary morbidity, mortality and healthcare
costs. While histologic grade of resected tumors correlates with patient outcome, it is only available after surgical
treatment and cannot be used to inform pre-surgery management or surgical planning. We have developed and
validated CANARY, a radiomic biomarker that predicts LUAD aggressiveness. We have further developed two
gene expression biomarkers from resected FFPE Stage I LUAD for predicting indolent or aggressive tumor
histology. These gene expression biomarkers are insensitive to intratumoral heterogeneity, suggesting that they
might retain good performance when measured in limited tissue available from small, presurgical biopsies. This
is potentially transformative as histologic assessment of these small biopsies is frequently insufficient for
predicting tumor aggressiveness. Our goal is to refine and validate these radiomic and gene expression
biomarkers and then integrate them into a single model for detecting indolent and aggressive Stage I LUAD,
which is supported by our preliminary data. To accomplish these goals, we will prospectively enroll a cohort of
patients undergoing transthoracic or transbronchial biopsy for suspected lung cancer and collect additional
specimens for research. In the subset of tumors who are later resected for Stage I LUAD, we will perform a
central pathologic assessment of tumor grade. Predicting tumor histologic grade at resection will be the primary
endpoint for assessing the performance of the integrated presurgical prediction model. Refinement of the
radiomic biomarker will involve testing whether the addition of features extracted from the peri-nodular lung using
deep learning can improve the prediction of the Stage I LUAD histologic grade. Refinement of the gene
expression biomarker will involve determining their performance in biopsy tumor tissue relative to resected tumor
tissue and optimizing the biomarkers for assessment in biopsies. Finally, we will develop and assess an
integrated model combining both radiomics and gene expression. As a secondary endpoint, we will compare
the association between recurrence free survival and predicted tumor grade vs. actual tumor grade at resection.
An improved ability to predict tumor aggressiveness prior to treatment has the potential to transform the
management of Stage I LUAD as it could allow clinicians and patients to confidently choose precisely tailored
treatment. The team from Boston University, Boston Medical Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and
Lahey Hospital & Medical Center has the diverse expertise in lung cancer clinical care, advanced bronchoscopy,
interventional radiology, histology, pathology, radiology, radiomics, molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics,
deep learning and biostatistics required to complete this project."
10911317,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project is centered on the hypothesis that RNA structure and RNA-chromatin associated protein
interactions play crucial roles in maintaining genome stability. It is known that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)
interact with protein components of chromatin, thus altering the higher order genetic architecture and gene
expression. A subset of these RNA-protein interactions are linked to ageing, cancer metastasis, and neuronal
development. As genomic approaches begin to identify RNA-protein associations and their links to cancer,
there remain key gaps in our knowledge regarding epigenetic-based RNA binding proteins. RNA can mimic
DNA, form transient DNA/RNA hybrids under cell stress, and function as scaffolds to recruit protein complexes
to chromatin. Further, these RNAs can interact with structured and disordered protein regions to form
multivalent networks that can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, or biomolecular condensates. Thus,
examining RNA-protein assemblies in solution and in a condensed, clustered state akin to a compact cell
environment can address fundamental questions: 1) What are the sequence requirements or structural
features that drive formation of multivalent RNA-protein interactions? And 2) How do RNA-protein
conformational changes impact the function and activity of chromatin associated proteins? In this proposal, we
seek to understand how RNA interacts with the lysine specific demethylase-1 (LSD1) enzyme. LSD1 is an
essential methylation regulator and has oncogenic properties in many cancers due to its vast interaction
network and association with RNAs in cell differentiation and DNA damage response pathways. We will focus
on the telomeric repeat containing RNA (TERRA) that interacts with LSD1 in response to DNA damage at the
ends of chromosomes. These RNA-LSD1 interactions are involved in the regulation of heterochromatin at
telomeres. The co-I (Zhang) has discovered that telomere clustering occurs in telomerase-free cancer cells
and that this process is driven through RNA-mediated phase separation. We will use integrative structural and
cell biology approaches to demonstrate how specific nuclei acid structures engage with LSD1 and how larger
nucleic acids may serve as functional coregulators in telomere maintenance. We hypothesize that higher-order
RNA topologies function as crucial mediators of chromatin-associated proteins. The specific aims of this
proposal are thus 1) to define the structural mechanism and auto-regulatory role of an intrinsically disordered
region of LSD1, 2) to identify the mechanism of action for LSD1-RNA assemblies involved in telomere
maintenance, and 3) to determine the architecture and conformational rearrangements of a higher-order
TERRA in solution and in a biomolecular condensate state. The long-term goal of this project is to understand
how RNA structure and conformational dynamics influence LSD1-mediated regulatory networks. Results from
these studies will provide new mechanistic insight into RNA-based chromatin biology and serve as a starting
point in the development of therapeutics that target LSD1 and RNA in a context-specific manner."
10922813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a group of heterogeneous brittle bone disorders. Over 95% of patients
harbor dominantly inherited structural mutations in the type I procollagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) or
recessively inherited mutations in the protein complexes important in type I collagen post-translational assembly
and hydroxylation. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for OI. While off-label use of anti-resorptive
bisphosphonates has become a de facto standard of care especially in children with OI, their clinical impact on
fracture incidence, mild OI type I (> 50% of patients), and adult, severe OI with lower bone formation is unclear.
This highlights the critical need of therapeutic innovations for OI. Taking anabolic approaches, we have shown
in adult OI that teriparatide (PTH 1-34) increases lumbar spine BMD in mild OI type I, but surprisingly, had no
significant effect in severe OI, suggesting the possibility of combinatorial therapy to overcome PTH insensitivity.
We and others have shown that collagen over-modification and altered cross-linking lead to abnormal
mineralization and altered extracellular matrix (ECM)-to-cell signaling, in particular, excessive TGFβ signaling in
OI in mice (Col1a2G610C/+ and Crtap-/-). Pan-anti-TGFβ treatment rescued the skeletal phenotype in these mice.
In primary fetal rat osteoblasts, TGFβ downregulates PTH 1 receptor, which led us to hypothesize that TGFβ
signaling contributes to PTH insensitivity in moderate and severe OI (Aim 1). On the severe end of the spectrum,
others have shown that Col1a1Jrt/+ mice also have increased TGFβ; however, they did not respond to anti-TGFβ
at doses that were effective in the moderate OI models. In our phase 1 anti-TGFβ clinical trial, increase lumbar
spine BMD was observed in moderate but not severe OI participants after a single dose. Our unpublished
preliminary data also showed increase TGFβ in our mild Col1a1+/- OI mice. We therefore hypothesize a wide
dose/frequency range requirement for anti-TGFβ among different OI severities and a bone-targeted antibody
can improve efficacy and safety across all types (Aim 2). TGFβ is also critical in fracture healing. We previously
found delayed fracture healing with reduced callus size in Col1a2G610C/+ and Crtap-/- mice and anti-TGFβ further
reduced this. This observation underscores the importance for studying the effects of anti-TGFβ in the course of
fracture repair for future clinical management (Aim 3). Finally, understanding the mechanism of TGFβ excess in
OI bone could potentially lead to new therapeutic targets. One hypothesis for this is decreased interaction
between abnormal collagen and small leucine rich proteoglycans, like Decorin, which sequester mature TGFβ
(Aim 4). Our overall goal is to answer the questions and unmet needs around targeting TGFβ in OI. Aim 1. Is
PTH insensitivity in mice and patients with OI type III/IV due to excessive TGFβ? Aim 2. Develop a bone-
targeted anti-TGFβ antibody and determine the dose range for mild, moderate, and severe OI. Aim 3.
Assess the short and long-term effects of anti-TGFβ treatment in OI fracture repair. Aim 4. Determine the
genetic requirement of Decorin in modulating excessive TGFβ in OI."

The primary objectives of the Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) Core will be to establish and characterize PDXs,
and to support the research aims of the two integrated research projects of UCaTS, a disparity-relevant studies
PDX Development and Trials Center (D-PDTC). The PDX Core will be responsible for the creation and
characterization of 120 PDX models in immune-deficient mice (NSG) from tumors of patients with either gastric
or lung cancers and diagnosed at any of the six sites: The five NCI designated comprehensive cancer centers
(CCC) of the University of California (UC) system (Davis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine and San Diego)
and the University of Texas Southwestern CCC. All of the newly established PDX lines will be from tumors
harvested frompatients representing racial/ethnic minorities based on the combined catchment areas we expect
to enrich for Latino and Asian American, Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (AANHPI) patients. These PDX
models will be used to generate cohorts of specific individual tumor-bearing (PDX) mice for drug efficacy and
disparities studies. The PDX Core will consist of the expertise and infrastructure of experienced and capable
shared resources at the UCDCCC (The Mouse Biology Shared Resource [MBSR] and the Biorepository Shared
Resource [BSR]. Over the last five years, the MBSR and BSR have been involved in establishing, maintaining,
characterizing, storing, and distributing numerous PDX models from human patients and PetDX models from
veterinary patients in dedicated, highly-contained, and infectious pathogen-free environments. Specifically,
during UCaMP, the core implanted 383 distinct tumors which were passaged to successfully establish 101
models in which the majority of models were derived from racially/ethnically communities of color. Further, by
engaging qualified and experienced personnel and fully functioning and readily available infrastructure in two
preexisting shared resources, the only costs charged to the grant budget are limited solely to PDX modeling
services for this project. In this way, the PDX Core will be integral to the successful development of PDX trial
strategies for preclinical testing of single agents and drug combinations that can feasibly lead to clinical
validation. The PDX Core will also contribute to the PDX Network (PDXNet) by facilitating the deposition of PDX
models, tumors, and data into the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository at the Frederick National Laboratory
for Cancer Research so that our models can be shared with the wider research community in addition sharing
of the PDXs among UCaTS members. In addition, the PDX Core will also work with the PDXNet to develop and
validate SOPs for development and characterization of PDX models for pre-clinical testing."

The overall objective of the proposed Diversity PDX Development and Testing Center (D-PDTC) is directed at
improving cancer precision medicine approaches for gastric and lung cancers. This will be achieved through the
large-scale development and molecular characterization of over 120 new minority gastric and lung PDX tumor
models and to utilize these for in vitro and pre-clinical PDX trials to test the efficacy of molecularly-matched
therapeutics administered as single agents or combination. Statistical testing for drug-responsiveness will be
performed, as well as the application of data integration strategies that relate treatment responses with molecular
characteristics of individual PDXs and patients’ tumors. The goal of Bioinformatics Core (UBC) is to provide
extensive data analytic support for the proposed studies at multiple stages including study design, molecular
characterization of the PDXs, target selection, and statistical correlation and modeling of drug responses. The
UBC will be established, and have considerable capabilities, by bringing together key personnel with strengths
in genomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and by leveraging the existing infrastructure at the UCD
Comprehensive Cancer Center, specifically the Biorepository, Genomics, and Biostatistics Shared Resources.
The UBC will facilitate the seamless integration of our U54 through dynamic interactions with its investigators,
and via the implementation of a dedicated UCaTS Bioinformatics Core relational database that will serve as a
data repository and interface for linking project design, sample tracking, data analysis, and eventual data sharing.
For genetic characterization of the PDX models, and associated patient tumors, we will apply a suite of
established bioinformatics analysis pipelines implemented on a high-performance ultra-rapid next-generation
sequencing data analysis platform for processing whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data to
generate the fundamental results datasets consisting of fully annotated 1) genomic variants and 2) transcripts
with corresponding expression values. Additional tumor properties that can figure prominently in guiding
therapeutic decisions, such as mutational burden will also be defined. Subsequently, integrative bioinformatics
approaches will be applied for target prioritization and treatment matching, which will be followed by biostatistical
analyses to evaluate both drug responses and the accuracy of novel molecular biomarkers. The UBC will also
collaborate with the PDXNet, PDMR-FNLCR, and PDTCs for data sharing and participation in PDX trials."

Gastric cancer (GC) is a leading cause of cancer incidence, mortality, and survival disparities in Latinos, the
largest and youngest U.S. minority and the largest racial/ethnic group in the UCaTS states of California and
Texas. When compared to non-Latino whites (NLW), GC incidence and mortality is ~>2-fold higher in Latinos.
Indeed, among all cancer types, GC is the malignancy with the highest disparity ratio among Latinos. Latinas
have a 2.6-fold higher GC mortality compared to NLW women, while Latino men are at a 2.1.-fold higher risk of
dying when diagnosed with GC relative to NLW men. Despite this high GC burden and the fact that most gastric
tumors carry “druggable” mutations, only three targeted therapies have been approved for GC. As part of our
ongoing UCaMP (University of California Minority Patient-Derived Xenograft Development and Trial) minority-
focused PDTC, we have shown that most GC molecular subtypes in Latinos carry druggable mutations and that
they are particularly enriched in tumors carrying multiple and complex genome alterations in PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
CDK, WNT, and RTK/RAS pathway genes. Over half of Latino tumors have mutations in multiple genes in these
and other pathways. Because ~35% of Latino GCs have dual/concurrent PI3K and CDK pathway alterations, we
will initially focus our studies using these two pathways but will aim to expand to other type of tumors with co-
mutated pathways. This project aims to develop a body of pre-clinical and mechanistic data that will help address
Latino GC disparities, and that will be necessary for the establishment of minority-focused clinical trials of
targeted therapies. As part of our NCI-funded UCaMP PDTC, our UCaTS research team has already successfully
created 55 patient-derived GC models, with ~60% of the models from Latinos. We have also shown that Latino
PDXs are responsive to dual treatments with PI3K inhibitors (PI3Ki) and CDK inhibitors (CDKi) and have
identified a model with PIK3CA hotspot mutations with an exquisite response to the PIK3i taselisib. Using our
UCaTS infrastructure of six comprehensive cancer centers in California and Texas, our goal in the next cycle of
our U54 study is to establish an additional 60 GC models, all from minorities, and to work on the following aims:
i) To evaluate GC patient-derived models for identifying efficacious drug combination in tumors with multiple
pathway alterations; ii) To understand the mechanisms of response to taselisib in PIK3CA mutant tumors and;
iii) To evaluate the effect of genetic ancestry in response to chemotherapies and targeted therapies in Latinos.
Through these studies we will develop effective drug combinations that can be rapidly translated into minority-
focused clinical trials for gastric cancer patients."
10733434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rise of antibiotic resistance in hospital-acquired enterococcal pathogens constitutes a serious clinical
threat. In particular, enterococci are now extremely likely to display resistance to vancomycin, which has
historically functioned as the antibiotic of last resort for these pathogens, leaving the clinician with few viable
therapeutic options. Vancomycin resistance in these organisms invariably involves the acquisition of
resistance operons encoded on mobile DNA elements. These operons (which are ultimately derived from
antibiotic-producing soil microbes) encode enzymes that remodel the bacterial cell wall, and thereby confer
resistance to the antibiotic. Importantly, expression of these remodeling enzymes is controlled by a two-
component system, VanS/VanR, that senses the presence of the antibiotic and responds to this signal by
increasing transcription of the resistance genes. Little is known about how VanS, the sensor histidine kinase
of this two-component system, detects vancomycin; indeed, fundamental details remain obscure, including
whether VanS directly binds vancomycin, or whether it instead detects some downstream consequence of
vancomycin action. This proposal focuses on the two main forms of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)
found in patients, namely A- and B-type resistance. Using a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and
microbiological approaches, the proposed experiments will address the molecular mechanisms underlying
antibiotic recognition in these two types of VRE. The proposal builds upon preliminary observations revealing
that the A and B resistance phenotypes appear to rely on fundamentally different mechanisms of antibiotic
sensing. Hence, one Aim will focus on the VanS protein from B-type enterococci (VanSB), which is shown to
bind directly to vancomycin. The details underlying this interaction will be elucidated, as will the effects of
antibiotic action upon the enzymatic activities of VanSB. A second Aim focuses on VanSA, which does not
respond directly to the antibiotic. Accordingly, the precise identity of the activating signal will be probed. A
third Aim will provide structural information about the VanS and VanR proteins, in order to inform and direct
the functional efforts. Overall, the proposed work will yield fundamental insights into the functioning of an
antibiotic-sensing pathway; provide potential entry points for the rational redesign of therapeutics that will
enable them to evade detection by pathogens; and inform the development of antibiotic adjuvants that can
overcome bacterial surveillance systems and restore efficacy to well-tested drugs such as vancomycin."
10733437,"The engineering of living cells and microbes is driving a new era of cancer therapy. This transformative approach
allows for the genetic programming of living cells to intelligently sense and respond to environments, ultimately
adding specificity and efficacy that is otherwise unattainable with molecular-based therapeutics. Due to recent
microbiome studies indicating the prevalence of bacteria within the human body and specifically in tumor tissue,
bacteria have generated significant interest as cancer therapies. Additionally, a multitude of empirical studies
have demonstrated that administered bacteria home and selectively grow in tumors due to reduced immune
surveillance of tumor cores. Given their presence and selectivity for tumors, bacteria present a unique oppor-
tunity to be engineered as intelligent delivery vehicles for cancer therapy.
The objective of this proposal is to engineer and optimize S. typhimurium for metastatic colorectal cancer
therapy. Since animal based-testing regimes limit the rate of clinical progress, we will use a high-throughput,
bacteria-spheroid platform to rapidly test therapeutic payloads and production and release strategies. We will
also assess the effect of therapies on colorectal genetic backgrounds, and investigate spatio-temporal hetero-
geneity in 3D spheroids with the use of engineered cell reporters. We will then test lead candidates in mouse
models of primary and metastatic colorectal cancer to evaluate safety and efficacy. We will focus on colorectal
cancer due to several proof-of-concept studies from our lab demonstrating efficacy in colorectal spheroids and
animal models. In particular, we showed that oral delivery of bacteria can specifically colonize colorectal liver
metastases, providing an attractive delivery route as a cancer therapy. Since these metastases are often con-
fined to the liver, this approach can have a significant impact on tumor growth and survival. The research in this
proposal will help to establish a framework to genetically engineer microbes for cancer therapy, and significantly
accelerates tools that will impact the broader cancer and synthetic biology communities. If successful, future
lead candidates for potential clinical trials will be identified on the basis of therapeutic efficacy and safety studies
from this proposal."
10904014,"Multimorbidity, the coexistence of two or more chronic and often aging-related diseases, affects the majority of
older adults. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in multimorbidity and individual aging-related diseases
including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and osteoporosis. Anti-inflammatory
therapy targeting IL1β reduces risk for cardiovascular disease, but clinical benefits of modulating inflammation
remain controversial. Animal studies suggest that the infiltration of immune cells including T helper cells into
the arterial wall, adipose, and other tissues may be the central mechanism underlying chronic inflammation
and subsequent diseases. Most human studies, however, rely on inflammatory biomarkers such as IL6 and
CRP, which lack mechanistic specificity. The paucity of human studies directly characterizing the immune cells’
role in the inflammatory process is a major gap retarding the translation of animal-based mechanistic work. We
propose that T helper cells are an important contributor to both chronic inflammation and subsequent diseases
because of their regulating immune response of both adaptive and innate immune cells including activation of
monocytes/macrophages. This view is supported by our preliminary data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA) which shows the associations of pro-inflammatory signatures of T helper cells with
multimorbidity, chronic inflammation, and inflammatory response of monocytes. While these microarray data
support the role of T helper cells in chronic inflammation and multimorbidity, large longitudinal studies are
needed to establish whether cellular features precede disease development. The proposed study will leverage
the unique resource of isolated human T helper cells in MESA (N=1,900). We hypothesize that cellular
features that coordinate the inflammatory response in peripheral T helper cells contribute to subsequent
chronic inflammation, inflammatory changes in peripheral monocytes, and multimorbidity. To test this
hypothesis, we will examine the following specific aims: 1) to examine whether omics profiles of T helper cells
predict 11-year changes in multimorbidity in 1,900 MESA participants, 2) to evaluate whether omics profiles of
T helper cells predict 6-year changes in omics profiles of monocytes and circulating pro-inflammatory
biomarkers in 1,900 individuals, and 3) To test effects of pharmacological modulation of T helper cells from
MESA participants on inflammatory responses. The proposed study will for the first time investigate the
longitudinal relationship between omics profiles of T helper cells and multimorbidity in humans. The results
from the proposed study will improve our understanding of inflammatory processes in humans, particularly their
cellular features, and accelerate the development of more precisely targeted anti-inflammatory interventions for
preventing multimorbidity."
10841608,"An estimated 1/3 of the world population is already infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), with an almost 5-10% of latent infected patients
developing active tuberculosis during their lifetime. In the last three years, infection with severe
acute respiratory syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, a.k.a. SCV2) the causative agent of
COVID-19, has resulted in 6.5 million deaths. According to the WHO Global TB Report 2022,
the SCV2 pandemic in 2020-2021 was associated with the reversal of the steady decline in TB
death rate for the first time since 2005. Our long-term goal is to better control tuberculosis and
manage cases of superinfection with SCV2 as well as gain insight to immunological consequences
of SCV2 infection. Preliminary data from our group indicated SCV2 superinfection increased M.
tb loads in murine lungs and promoted dissemination to extra-pulmonary organs, which was
associated with specific changes in immunomodulatory cytokines (e.g., IFN-g and IL10) and
decreased general inflammation in the lungs. These data underpinned our central hypothesis that
SCV2 superinfection compromises anti-TB immunity, leading to greater dissemination of M. tb.
To address the central hypothesis we plan to I) Characterize the TB/SCV2 superinfection in a
latent murine model of TB using C3HeB/FeJ mice in a setup termed Immune Competent TB Model
(ICTM); II) Define mechanisms of M. tb dissemination during SCV2 superinfection by targeting
IFN-g and IL-10 cytokines using reporter and repletion murine models that are infected with M. tb
before superinfection with SCV2 BA.5. Finally, III) Examine M. tb progression in Diversity
Outbred (DO) mouse model compared to inbred mice to characterize mycobacterial growth phase
associated with pathological and immunological changes during TB/SCV2 superinfection.
 Outcomes from this project will further improve our understanding of TB immunopathogenesis
and how latent infections in humans can convert to active cases of TB including furthering
knowledge on the granuloma’s role in containment and pathogenesis. Importantly, gained
knowledge could help in understanding TB immunopathogenesis during any future respiratory
superinfection, not SCV2 alone. Future research building on outcomes from this project could
help in the control of both TB and COVID-19 pandemics that could be tailored for other respiratory
emerging infections (e.g. Influenza)."
10885187,"Quinlan, Katharina Project Summary
This project pursues the hypothesis that in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy (CP), primary afferent
depolarization (PAD), a type of presynaptic modulation of Ia afferents, contributes to hypertonia, hyperreflexia
and reflex irradiation. We have recently shown that spontaneous tonic activity of nociceptors contributes to
PAD. Recent evidence from a large animal model of CP shows nociceptor sprouting is present along with more
PAD and reflex irradiation. We propose parallel studies in people with and without CP and rabbits after
prenatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) at 70% gestation. The rabbit HI model shows hallmarks of spastic CP including
cell death in the cortex, white matter injury, thinning of the corticospinal tracts, muscle stiffness, hyperreflexia,
reflex irradiation, and changes in muscle architecture consistent with spastic CP. This study will investigate
mechanisms by which nociceptive afferent expansion influences PAD in rabbits and humans and tests the
effectiveness of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) to reduce spasticity in both rabbits and people. AIM
1: Compare nociceptive drive to GABAaxo neurons and PAD in HI/CP. Corticospinal innervation of spinal
GABAaxo neurons is weakened by developmental injury. We hypothesize that this results in expanded
nociceptor innervation of GABAaxo neurons and increased amplitude of nociceptor driven PAD, which then
increases intersegmental Ia afferent conduction and reflex irradiation. Therefore, PAD will be measured in
people with CP using conditioning of the H reflex by CST and other sensory pathways known to activate PAD,
and using the in vitro rabbit spinal cord, stimulation of sensory and descending pathways and pharmacology.
Expected outcome: Nociceptor-driven PAD and reflex irradiation will be larger in HI/CP. AIM 2: Quantify
nociceptive synaptic contacts onto GABAaxo neurons in HI/CP. Nociceptive expansion occurs in CP/HI,
potentially increasing synapses onto GABAaxo neurons, consistent with Aim 1. We hypothesize in HI/CP,
additional synapses between nociceptors and GABAaxo neurons are concomitant with fewer CST contacts. We
will quantify CGRP+ - GAD2+ contacts in rabbits and postmortem human tissue and CST-GAD2+ contacts
using dye labeling and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in rabbits. Expected outcome: Nociceptor expansion in
CP/HI will extend onto GABAaxo neurons driving aberrant PAD. AIM 3: Therapeutic blockade of nociceptors.
TENS appears to reduce nociceptor neurotransmission, possibly via opioid and 5HT1D receptors. We
hypothesize that in CP/ HI, use of lumbosacral TENS will reduce nociceptor-driven PAD, hyperreflexia, and
reflex irradiation through a mechanism involving activation of spinal opioid and 5HT1D receptors, possibly
through activation of a brainstem pathway. Lumbosacral TENS will be tested in rabbits and humans for its
ability to reduce spasticity. In rabbits, mechanisms of action of TENS will be pharmacologically dissected in
vivo intrathecally and in vitro to determine involvement of 1) 5HT1D 2) α5GABAA and 3) opioid receptors.
Expected outcome: TENS will reduce reflex irradiation / spasticity."
10868743,"Periodontal disease represents one of the most prevalent diseases in adult population as 47% of
Americans over age 30 have the disease. Periodontitis is a complex immune and inflammatory disease,
characterized by three major pathological features: exacerbating inflammatory response, excess
osteoclastic alveolar bone resorption and decreased osteoblastic bone formation. Unfortunately, there
are only palliative treatments in clinics currently. Our laboratory has explored a variety of strategies to ameliorate
the severity of the disease including application of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) with major transcription factors, such as Runx2, Osx and SATB2 in cell-based gene-therapy,
but at the meantime experienced drawbacks and limitations of these approaches. Therefore, we are actively
searching for a new therapy that blocks the major pathogenetic elements and stimulates endogenous factors to
regenerate the tissues lost in periodontitis. Epigenetic molecules have recently emerged as potent regulators of
gene expression and therapeutic agents for a variety of human diseases. We for the first time found that the
novel synthetic BET protein inhibitor, JQ1, specifically inhibits periodontal inflammation and significantly
reduces alveolar bone loss in murine periodontitis model. Additionally, we are the first to identify miR-335-5p
and characterized its role in promoting bone formation and regeneration. Overexpressing miR-335-5p
ameliorates tissue damage in experimental periodontitis which further provides a foundation and a strong
premise for the current proposal. In this proposal we will use an elegantly designed and precisely synthesized
nanoparticle (NP) system that will carry both JQ1 and miR-335-5p and specifically release them into major target
cells in periodontitis, resulting in a block of the pathogenesis and activation of endogenous regenerative factors.
In Aim 1, we will delineate the molecular mechanisms of miR-335-5p effects in periodontitis under gene
deficient and overexpressing conditions using our newly generated genetically manipulated rodents. In Aim
2, we will define the epigenetic effects of nanoparticle-mediated precision and specific delivery of JQ1
and miR-335-5p on their corresponding target cells. In Aim 3, we will determine the therapeutic efficacy
of combined application of epi-modulators in a mouse model of periodontitis. We will deliver the epi-
biological nano-products simultaneously, individually, or alternatingly to assess the therapeutic impact at different
disease stages. Outcome measures will include unbiased single cell RNA-sequencing, 16S rDNA profiling,
qualitative and quantitative periodontal analyses and pharmacokinetics. Using innovative epigenetic approaches
to understand the pathophysiology of periodontal disease and its therapeutic potentials is a paradigm shift.
This investigation will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team composed of the PI and three C-Is who have
profound knowledge and complementary skills in the following areas: Experimental Pathology and Bone
Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Inflammation and Immunology, and Biomaterials and Drug Delivery."
10922853,"ABSTRACT
In recent years, cannabis, and its constituents (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] and cannabidiol [CBD]) have
been promoted as natural remedies, with chronic disease patients as prominent marketing targets.
Consequently, adults with underlying medical conditions are more likely to use cannabis compared to adults
without medical conditions. This is alarming given that evidence for therapeutic benefits or potential risks related
to cannabis use is generally lacking. Additionally, the impact of cannabis use on the clinical course of chronic
diseases, which could be significant, is unknown. Here, we propose to recruit a prospective cohort of adult
patients with early-stage high blood pressure (BP). This sizable population (30% of all United States adults) are
at a heightened risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We will recruit patients from primary care clinics in
Michigan, where cannabis is legal for adult consumption, and use data from detailed questionnaires, physical
exams and biospecimen collections across the 30-month study to a) characterize cannabis use trajectories
among patients, b) estimate the association between cannabis use trajectories and cardiovascular risk status
and c) estimate the association between cannabis use trajectories and underlying mechanisms of CVD including
systemic inflammation, platelet aggregation and arterial vasospasm. We hypothesize that persistent or
escalating high THC cannabis smoking trajectories will predict worsened cardiovascular risk status in patients
with high BP compared to other use trajectories (e.g., high CBD, oral ingestion, cessation) or non-use.
Epidemiological studies on the cardiovascular health effects of cannabis are scarce, their results are mixed, and
they lack cannabis and CVD measurements proposed here. We will study the cardiovascular health effects of
cannabis use while accounting for cannabis potency and route of administration. Existing research relied heavily
on controlled laboratory studies, conducted using NIDA-supplied cannabis that differs from cannabis used in the
real world. Hence, generalizability and applicability to human health remain uncertain. We will adapt a mobile
pharmacology laboratory approach to assess the potency of cannabis products available to patients in Michigan.
This proposal is important and timely given the recent changes in cannabis policies. In 2018, Michigan became
the first state in the Midwest to legalize cannabis for recreational use. On the other hand, CVD is the leading
cause of death in Michigan and the state rank poorly relative to other states. Characterizing cannabis use
trajectories and how they relate to cardiovascular health over time is essential for cannabis policies, to identify
which trajectories are associated with fewer or greater cardiovascular risks and communicate these risks and
harm reduction strategies to the public. Our results will also inform medical cannabis recommendations, not only
for patients with high BP, but for a diverse group of patients who need cannabis for the management of anorexia,
pain, anxiety, or sleep problems, and are at increased risk of CVD (e.g., patients with HIV, depression, post-
traumatic stress disorder and neuropathies)."
10914915,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which causes Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19), has become a global health crisis. To date, more than 6.5 million deaths from COVID-19 have
been reported worldwide. Amongst survivors, neurocognitive dysfunction and neuropsychiatric disorders, such
as anxiety and depression, are increasingly recognized and can persist for months, or even years. This enduring
neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric distress obligates us to address critical questions about their duration, risk
factors, and underlying mechanisms. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 promotes
cognitive decline in subjects who were previously normal via stimulating inflammatory pathways, with the
greatest risk being in older adults, females, and those from underrepresented groups. We propose to utilize
patients in our biorepository, who were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to achieve three Specific Aims:
(1) to determine the type and duration of neurocognitive dysfunction present; (2) to ascertain risk factors for
ongoing cognitive decline, including sex, age, race/ethnicity and comorbidities; and, (3) to verify that persistent
neuroinflammation underlies cognitive decline. To achieve these Aims, our team has established a well-curated,
highly diverse biorepository of more than 650 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. About 15% have succumbed
to COVID-related illnesses; however, 37% have continued to return for testing at 3-6 and 12-months post
hospitalization. Preliminary data demonstrates that 30% of subjects returning at one year show progressive
cognitive decline, which is associated with elevated markers of inflammation and neuronal stress. Here we
propose to follow these patients and perform detailed cognitive testing and assess biomarkers from their blood-
serum, spinal fluid, and imaging to explicate the type and time course of cognitive changes present, the risk
factors associated with cognitive dysfunction, and whether inflammation-induced neuronal distress underlies
progressive neurocognitive impairment. This proposal is innovative because we are evaluating the long-term
neurocognitive consequences of severe COVID-19 from a cohort that we have followed since the onset of the
pandemic, which has provided preliminary data supporting our Aims. Moreover, we have brought together
investigators with expertise in cognitive assessment and treatment, and basic and translational research, all in
the setting of a strong institutional infrastructure. Our work is significant because understanding the role of
persistent neuroinflammation in COVID-19-induced cognitive dysfunction will greatly enhance our ability to
rationally test immunosuppressants for this very debilitating disorder."

The global virome is incredibly diverse and emerging viruses threaten global health. Unfortunately, few infection
models can recapitulate natural transmission and evolution. Here we propose to bridge natural and experimental
systems to study real-time transmission dynamics within and between hosts and infer virus-pathogen
relationships. To accomplish this we will leverage a model whereby the natural rodent pathogens from pet store
mice are exposed to laboratory mice, rats, hamsters, or deer mice. This model offers a platform for studying
acute transmission of viruses between and within hosts via natural mechanisms. One major advantage of this
model is that you can access the entire transmission chain from the reservoir tissue, to what is shed, to what
either succeeds or fails to replicate in the new host. Aim 1 of this proposal will test the hypothesis that the duration
of exposure, interferon and stage of infection in the reservoir shape virus transmission and evolution. In this aim
we will address fecal oral and respiratory transmission. Aim 2 of this proposal will test the hypothesis that
evolutionary distance and interferon determine the success of cross-species transmission events. To address
this we will use wt and STAT2 deficient rats, hamsters, and deer mice. Importantly, this proposal will generate
STAT2 deficient rats. Currently, there are no innate immune deficient rats exists and this proposal will provide
an invaluable tool for the field. We will measure the capacity of natural mouse viruses to cross the species barrier
and determine the impact of evolutionary distance and innate antiviral responses. Overall, this proposal will
develop and exploit a model system allows for the analysis of transmission of natural rodent viruses to
characterize biological barriers to zoonosis."
10899590,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in RNA splicing, editing, nuclear export, translation, turnover, and
subcellular localization. Reflecting their importance, RBPs and their cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have
broad implications in human health: mutations in RBPs or CREs have well-established roles in cancer,
developmental defects, particularly in neural development, and in neural degenerative diseases.
Using a combination of a high-throughput, in-vitro-selection-based RNA binding assay, RNAcompete, and
machine learning (ML) models trained to map from an RBP’s protein sequence to its RNA binding preferences,
this project will endeavor to assign RNA sequence- and structural-context binding preferences to all human
RBPs, all vertebrate RBPs, and the vast majority of metazoan RBPs. These specificities will then be used to
detect and assign function to RBPs and cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in human genomes, as well as those
of other model organisms. The specificities, machine learning models, and predicted CREs will be distributed
widely via publication, open-source software, and user-friendly web tools like cisBP-RNA.
This project has the potential to transform cancer and human genetics research supporting the estimation of
the functional impact of germline or somatic mutations on post-transcriptional regulation (PTR). By improving
the reconstruction of PTR networks, this project will speed research in this emerging field toward a complete
understanding of this key process. This project will also permit the study of the evolution of PTR by developing
tools to reconstruct PTR networks in other organisms based solely on genomic and transcriptomic data.
RNAcompete will be used to assess the RNA sequence-binding preferences of the 511 still-uncharacterized
RBPs in humans and D. rerio (zebrafish), thereby establishing a complete catalog of binding preferences for all
likely sequence-specific RBPs in these two species. These data will be combined with binding data for >500
other RBPs from a variety of sources and used to train an ML model that reconstructs RNA-binding
preferences given RBP protein sequences. These models will also leverage recent advances in de novo
prediction of protein structure from sequence. RBPs will be assigned roles in PTR based on (i) the location and
conservation, in human transcripts of their predicted target CREs, (ii) the correlation of their expression with
the PTR fate of their putative target transcripts, and (iii) other, more powerful regression methods like the
Inferelator. CRE predictions will be continuously improved using in vivo data to recalibrate in vitro motif models
and to improve in silico predictions of transcript RNA secondary structure. Our predicted CREs and
reconstructed PTR networks will be validated by comparisons with in vivo data collected by our team and
others."
10732253,"Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disease with an unknown etiology. The global increase in
ASD incidence suggests that genetics alone is unlikely to be the major driver of ASD, but that the increased
prevalence is likely due to altered exposures to environmental factors. In fact, we know that numerous
environmental exposures (nutrients, chemicals, stress, etc.) impact child health, typically exerting their toxicity
through either metabolites or perturbations in endogenous pathways, making metabolomics analysis a key
emerging technology to elucidate the relationships between these exposures and ASD. But how do we directly
measure these early life exposures? Central to our study is the use of novel tooth matrix biomarkers, which
takes advantage of the incremental developmental biology of teeth (similar to tree growth rings). The
techniques that we have developed allow us to temporally distinguish exposure between the 2nd trimester, 3rd
trimesters, and postnatal periods, enabling identification of the sensitive life stages in fetal and neonatal
development most strongly associated with ASD risk. For the present application, we will perform the first
targeted organic analysis of ASD teeth to delineate associations between toxicant mixtures from various
exposure sources (polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates, and organochlorine pesticides) and
autism. This will be supported by the first large-scale untargeted metabolomics analysis of ASD teeth to
delineate unique metabolic alterations in corresponding autism and non-autism children, and generate new
hypothesis on early life etiology of ASD. As both analyses will be executed in the same tooth extract, we will
also perform a multifactorial analysis, exploring the relationships between targeted toxicant exposures,
metabolomics profiles, and ASD. We will undertake this work in the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and
the Environment (CHARGE) cohort, which has a wealth of harmonized phenotypic, demographic, medical,
genetic, and environmental data for high efficiency analysis. We will use novel statistical methodology,
weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), that addresses effects of high-dimensional mixtures and increases
power when compared to traditional methods to discover biomarkers and biological pathways associated with
ASD (n=318) or typical development (n=190) (neither ASD nor other developmental delays (n=105)). Our
method is a non-invasive advancement in technology to obtain direct and repeated fetal measures of
biomarkers associated with early life etiology of ASD."
10732254,"ABSTRACT
There is growing evidence that early-life environmental exposures are contributing to the
increasing prevalence of allergic diseases including food allergy. Food allergy rates, particularly
for peanut, have increased dramatically in industrialized countries over the last few decades,
suggesting environmental factors are driving the epidemic. Recent studies show that inhalational
or cutaneous exposure to peanut within the home may be a risk factor for peanut allergy. In
addition to food antigens, the indoor exposome also includes immunostimulatory agents, such as
microbial products and air pollutants, which can act as adjuvants and promote allergic
sensitization to antigens. Whether exposure to environmental adjuvants influences peanut allergy
development is unclear. We have developed a novel mouse model that mimics inhalational
exposure to environmental peanut within the home. We have found that co-exposure to inhaled
peanut and indoor dust, which contains environmental adjuvants to which children are exposed,
induced allergic sensitization and the development of peanut allergy in mice. Moreover, we have
found that co-exposure to inhaled peanut and air pollutants, including diesel exhaust particles and
particulate matter, also induced peanut allergy in our animal model. In this proposal, we will
determine if exposure to environmental adjuvants in indoor dust is associated with peanut
sensitization in infants, and also investigate the mechanisms by which environmental adjuvants
(e.g., indoor dust, air pollutants) promote peanut allergy development. In Aim 1, we will use an
airway sensitization animal model and primary human bronchial epithelial cell culture system to
compare the adjuvant activity of indoor dust samples collected from the homes of peanut-
sensitized and nonsensitized infants, and determine if adjuvant activity is associated with peanut
sensitization status. In Aim 2, we will use animal models to define the innate immune signaling
pathways required for indoor dust-mediated airway sensitization to peanut. In Aim 3, we will
investigate the immunological mechanisms by which inhaled air pollutants promote peanut allergy
development in our animal model. These studies will greatly expand our understanding of how
the indoor exposome influences food allergy development and help direct future environmental
interventions aimed at preventing peanut allergy in children."

Influenza is a leading cause of death in the elderly and current vaccines only protect a fraction of this population
despite widespread vaccination programs and specialized formulations. A better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms that control immunological aging is urgently needed so that newly designed vaccines, adjuvants
and pharmacologic interventions can be employed to restore youthful antibody (Ab) responses in the older
population. Our overarching goals are focused on determining the effects of aging on immune cells that mediate
the anti-influenza Ab vaccine response. We will perform an integrated and comprehensive evaluation of
circulating T follicular helper (Tfh), T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells and B cells as well as their subsets from
young and older individuals prior to and after seasonal influenza vaccination. We will test the hypothesis that a
consequence of advancing age is an altered distribution of individual subsets of Tfh/Tfr cells resulting in
metabolic reprogramming and defective B cell elicited influenza vaccine responses. Our integrated analysis
includes studies to investigate at the organismal and cellular level age-related declines in metabolic pathways,
such as defective mitochondrial biogenesis and one carbon metabolism and to determine if these changes
contribute to the immune dysfunction. Finally, knowledge gained from these studies will be used to perform
proof of concept rescue experiments in vitro to restore optimal influenza vaccine responsiveness. To support
these studies, samples will be used from a seasonal influenza vaccinee cohort of 153 participants (ages 21-76,
including 15 individuals ≥ 65yr) who have donated blood at days 0, 7 and 32 after quadrivalent hemagglutinin
(HA) vaccination. We plan a targeted expansion of this cohort to recruit an additional 100 donors ≥ 65 years of
age and a group of 25 younger adults (≤ 40yr, n=25) for single cell genomic and metabolomic studies that require
fresh blood samples. We will temporally follow the influenza vaccine response and compare young and older
groups. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine alterations in subset composition and metabolic reprogramming
in follicular T cells in young and aged individuals. The completion of these studies will allow us to understand
whether defects in humoral immunity associated with aging are mediated by changes in Tfh and Tfr subsets,
intrinsic functionality, or both. In Aim 2 we will assess characteristics of the Ab response and determine
composition and metabolic changes in B cell populations in young and aged individuals. At the completion of
these studies we will also understand changes that result in immune imprinting. In Aim 3 we will analyze age-
related dysfunction of Tfh, Tfr and B cells in vitro in response to influenza vaccine antigens. Tfh/B cell co-cultures
will be treated with immune modulators and small molecules to restore immunologic and metabolic function to
overcome age-related defects in vaccine responses. We have assembled a highly accomplished team to carry
out these studies with the goal of testing new paradigms and establishing an actionable roadmap on how to
improve vaccine responsiveness in the elderly."

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is associated with lung injury which can persist despite successful therapy. Lung
sequelae of treated PTB are increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and, an important contributor of excess morbidity and mortality. Our prior work
measuring lung function in a cohort of young and predominantly never-smoking adults with PTB who successfully
completed TB therapy found 14% had COPD, an additional 10% had airflow obstruction which responded to
bronchodilator therapy, and nearly 50% had a restrictive spirometry pattern. These data suggest that the
predominant phenotype of post-PTB chronic lung disease (CLD) may differ from that seen in smoking-associated
COPD. Post-PTB CLD may have distinct natural history, prognosis and therapeutic strategies which, till date,
have not been investigated. Our prior work also found that post-PTB CLD was associated with the duration of
illness prior to initiating TB therapy and high levels of slow-to-resolve pro-fibrotic cytokines during late TB therapy.
Together, these data suggest that the vast majority of acute lung injury associated with PTB likely occurs prior
to and shortly after initiating TB therapy, and that elevated or persistent levels of key immune markers may be
detrimental through their impact on lung tissue remodeling. However, few studies have prospectively
characterized immune markers associated with long-term functional outcomes in PTB. This is an important
knowledge gap preventing the identification of potentially modifiable immune pathways for targeted host-directed
therapies, and the optimal timing of intervention with these therapies, to prevent post-PTB CLD. To address
these knowledge gaps, we will nest a prospective cohort study within the RePORT-India TB Research
Consortium to 1) characterize the early natural history of post-PTB CLD and provide rationale for long-term
monitoring and bronchodilator therapy in affected cases, 2) characterize the functional and morphological
phenotype of post-PTB CLD by serial pulmonary function testing and multi-detector computed tomography, 3)

outcomes for CLD research; 2) potentially modifiable immune markers of chronic lung injury for future therapeutic
trials; and 3) advanced statistical methods for the integrated analysis of lung function, imaging and immunological
data. This K99/R00 award will help Dr. Gupte develop into an independent investigator conducting impactful
clinical research at the intersection of infectious and chronic lung diseases globally, while also building site
capacity and generating novel data to support subsequent R01 applications aimed at identifying diagnostic,
prognostic and therapeutic strategies for CLD in treated PTB."

 Retinal degenerative diseases are the leading cause of irreversible vision loss. There is no approved medical
intervention that could cure or reverse the courses of retinal degenerative diseases. Retina prosthesis are
implantable devices designed to stimulate sensation of vision in the eyes of individuals with these significant
conditions. Yet, due to the current spreading, resolution and pixel density are limited in the existing electrical
based devices. New technologies and methods are still being sought for precise and non-genetic implantable
retinal stimulation with an improved pixel density. In this application, we aim to develop an optoacoustic micro-
lens array (OAA). This array can generate a desired pattern of focus ultrasound for massively parallel retinal
stimulation with a focus size of 40-50 microns and pixel density up to 178 pixels per mm2. Such ultra-high spatial
precision, variable penetration and massive parallel capabilities enabled our focused optoacoustic technology
while incorporated in the soft implant design will offer clear advantages over existing methods. A multi-
disciplinary team with complementary expertise is assembled to perform the proposed activities. Prof. Chen
Yang (PI) is an expert in nanomaterials and development of new neural interface for modulation and
regeneration. Prof. Fried (Co-I, Mass General Hospital/Harvard Medical School) has considerable expertise
studying the responses of retinal and other CNS neurons to electric, magnetic, and other forms of artificial
stimulation. Prof. Ji-Xin Cheng (collaborator) is an expert in label-free chemical imaging and photoacoustic
devices. Our team has pioneered ultra-high precision optoacoustic neuromodulation. We have successfully
shown the retina can directly be stimulated by optoacoustic. These feasibility data led to our central hypothesis
that via the design of the optoacoustic lens arrays, optoacoustic is able to deliver massively parallel retinal
stimulation at an unprecedented 50 micro-meter spatial precision, serving a foundation for retinal prothesis. To
test this central hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate direct retinal
stimulation of four subtypes alpha RGC at micrometer-resolution by TFOE validated by patch clamp. In Aim 2,
we will demonstrate massively parallel retinal stimulation at micrometer resolution by OAA using multi-electron
array measurements. These efforts are expected to generate an implant design offering massively parallel and
high precision optoacoustic stimulation as genetics-free retinal prosthesis with translational potential to human."
10876999,"Hundreds of millions of ultrasound (US) exams are performed each year worldwide. Typical limitations of
conventional US imaging include operator dependence, limited field of view, limited contrast, and diffraction-
limited resolution. Volumetric imaging has the potential to create an operator-independent acquisition protocol,
and ultrafast US acquisition has opened new opportunities to address field-of-view and contrast issues. Our
extended aperture approach applied here addresses spatial resolution limitations as well. With high resolution,
real-time imaging capabilities and the lack of ionizing radiation, US has great promise for imaging pediatric
patients; in particular, for children under 3 who cannot be imaged with MRI or CT without anesthesia, the
development of a high-resolution volumetric US scanner would be transformative. In particular, we set out to
image the pediatric liver and kidney within ~0.1 second, which requires a technological leap. New ASIC switch
matrices will enable high speed acquisition and GPU-based partial beam formation enables the visualization of
the 3D data. Reconstruction of the 3D vascular structure facilitates image-based recognition of the anatomical
location of a lesion. Ultrafast SVD Doppler imaging allows the visualization of very small blood vessels with blood
flow velocities as low as 4 mm/s. Abdominal pain is very common in children and US is frequently used to
determine the cause.
Accurate volumetric measurements of the kidney are problematic due to patient motion
and operator-dependent scanning. Assaying the liver and abdomen, particularly in the context of trauma are
similarly important. Thus, we seek to create this real-time imaging tool with resolution that exceeds CT and MR
but without the need for anesthesia or radiation. Using 1024 active system channels with integrated GPU
beamformers, we will create 2 transducers to span the needs of children for this technology, with spatial
resolution at 5 cm (~300 (azimuth) x 600 (elevation) x 300 (depth) µm) that should exceed that offered by MRI
or CT by several fold. The array will be realized using tiled modules that can be switched in a mode-dependent
fashion to accomplish B-mode imaging, color Doppler and contrast imaging. Over the past four years, Stanford
University and the University of Southern California have designed an adult extended-aperture abdominal-
imaging system, and demonstrated the improved spatial resolution, field of view and contrast that can be
achieved. We exploit these tools here to develop a dedicated pediatric volumetric scanner. Our aims to
accomplish this are to 1) create and integrate acoustic/electronic transducers to implement signal buffering and
multiplexing; and 2) develop volumetric software and conduct pediatric imaging studies as a proof of concept.
We will develop the software and systems, test the system components on adult volunteers and phantoms, and
develop 3D volumetric processing. We will image a cohort of pediatric patients spanning 3D kidney volumetric
mapping, detection and mapping of previously detected liver lesions. In each case, MRI will provide the gold
standard."
10917272,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this 5-year K23 proposal is to support Melissa Mannion, MD, MSPH to become an
independent investigator using medical decision methodology to evaluate and improve personalized treatment
decisions for each patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). JIA is the most common rheumatic disease of
childhood and is a life-long chronic disease that requires long-term treatment to prevent pain, loss of physical
function, and permanent impairment. While there are recommendations regarding initial therapy, when that is
ineffective, the next best option is less clear and can be affected by patient, parent, and provider preferences.
Due to this uncertainty and the various attributes of treatment options, shared decision making (SDM) is
recommended for treatment decisions and can reduce decisional conflict, improve satisfaction with care, and
improve quality of life. Incorporation of SDM in routine clinical care is poor and, in pediatrics, is often reliant on
parents sharing medical information and making decisions. Parent-adolescent dyads with JIA report different
acceptable symptom state thresholds and different treatment experiences including adherence rates and
negative treatment effects, but it is unknown how this discordance affects subsequent preferences, decisions,
and outcomes. There is a critical need to identify and incorporate both adolescent and parent preferences into
decisions related to JIA medication and treatment targets. Therefore, the specific aims of this project include
Aim 1: identify optimal characteristics of a treatment escalation SDM tool in JIA according to patients, parents,
and providers, Aim 2: compare patient and parent preferences for treatment and goal priorities of JIA, and Aim
3: develop and pilot test decision aid in a pediatric rheumatology clinic among parent and adolescent patients
with JIA at the time of treatment change. I will use nominal group technique to identify characteristics of the
decision aid that will favorable impact care and promote adoption by patients, parents, and providers in routine
clinical workflow. I will use discrete choice experiment and latent class analysis to identify and quantify
preferences and tradeoffs related to medication choices and treatment goals for both adolescents with JIA and
their parents. I will develop a decision aid based on previously conducted qualitative research to facilitate
triadic (adolescent, parent, and provider) SDM for treatment escalation in JIA and pilot test the tool in a clinical
setting. The results of each aim will contribute to iterative revisions of the tool so that it will be optimized for a
subsequent larger trial. My expert multidisciplinary mentoring team will provide guidance and training in stated
preference methods and SDM, specifically related to pediatric triadic decisions. At the conclusion of this
project, I will be uniquely positioned for an independent research career using medical decision methodology to
improve the quality of life and disease outcomes for patients with JIA by improving SDM between patients,
parents, and providers."

10881939,"Summary:
The PDX Core of the UP-PDTC is the primary experimental laboratory of the extensive xenotransplantation
program at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Research into human cancers is increasingly dependent
on the transplantation of human tissues into highly immunocompromised mouse strains that allow various
degrees of humanization. The number and type of these models continues to increase. Over the last few
decades, researchers have developed models that lack T, B or NK cell function such as the NOD.Cg-
Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG)[1], the similar NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug/JicTac (NOG) [2] as well as mice
generated on this background with transgenes introduced to allow for expression of human growth factors or
cytokines that can enhance the engraftment, growth or function of human tissues. In other cases, transplantation
of multiple human tissues including fetal bone marrow, liver and thymus (BLT) allows for enhanced functionality
of engrafted tissue using the so called BLT mouse model[3]. Although there is relatively little by way of detailed
academic descriptions of the animal care requirements of these strains, multiple publications have demonstrated
that these strains are prone to infections and that such infections can change engraftment of human tissues or
behavior of human tissues after engraftment affecting experimental reproducibility and robustness [4-8]. Such
infections can impact on outcome of research experiments and this lack of reproducibility combined with the high
cost of maintaining these mouse strains has limited their adaptation and use. At UPENN, we have addressed
this concern by developing a specific Core facility, the Stem Cell and Xenograft Core (SCXC), which is focused
on maintenance of highly immunocompromised mouse strains and facilitating research. As shown below, we
have had wide acceptance and increasing use of our expertise and facility with numerous researchers adapting
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in particular. This success is due largely to a combination of an isolated
vivarium suite, development of facility specific standard operating procedures, and highly skilled and trained
personnel. UPENN has allowed us to adapt and utilize a 6 room suite in the Smilow Center for Translational
Research Building. Access to and animal husbandry within this suite is controlled by our animal staff. All users
must undergo training to access the SCXC animal suite and must adhere to strict sterility rules. The suite is
maintained using frequent cleaning and decontamination of all equipment on a routine basis. Using this space
and these guidelines, the animal use within the SCXC has increased to the point where we are providing 900
animals per month to users; space occupancy is currently running at 85% of predicted maximal capacity.
Importantly, we anticipate continued growth of animal use as we have helped to create our own mouse strains
using transgenic procedures performed within our suite, early adoption and characterization of unpublished
mouse strains (NSG-IL6) and the anticipated arrival of complex mouse strains such as the MISTRG mouse[9,
10]."
10918232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Einstein-Jefferson will continue to recruit cases for the three DILIN protocols; prospective, retrospective, and
acute, and to participate in all of its procedures and ancillary studies. At Einstein-Jefferson, our main objective
is to study liver injury due to Herbal and Dietary Supplements (HDS). Specifically, our approach will entail,
through Aim 1, ongoing recruitment of patients with drug and supplement induced liver injury, with several
alliances built to promote the enrollment of patients from under-represented minority (URM) groups. Such
enhanced enrollment of URMs will not only expand access to our study but will also support our analyses.
Related to this aim, we will validate for HDS induced liver injury (HILI) a recently published form of causality
assessment; the RECAM. In aim 2, through the DILIN HDS repository housed at Einstein, we will continue to
collect products from patients enrolled at all DILIN sites that have been implicated in liver injury for chemical
analysis at the National Center for Natural Products Research (NCNPR). Related to this aim, we will work with
the NCNPR to explore mechanisms of HILI, and also expand our collaboration on chemical analysis to include
other organizations, such as the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the Botanical Safety Consortium
(BSC). The expanded collaboration (NCNPR, NTP, BSC) will allow us to develop new analytical techniques
that will form the foundation for the design of human safety and therapeutic trials of multi-ingredient
supplements. The critical innovation of our research is explained in aim 3, with the formation of a multi-
stakeholder panel to conduct pharmacovigilance for HILI. This panel, comprising the DILIN group, FDA, CDC,
and the NTP will focus on detecting case clusters of HILI. Detection of case clusters will, in turn, facilitate
response to improve supplement safety through the FDA's regulatory actions, support the CDC's scientific
investigations to prove the association of injury with a product, and support the development of better analytical
techniques to detect injurious products through our collaboration with the NCNPR, NTP and the BSC. Related
to this aim, our research will update our prior work which defined the incidence of drug and supplement
induced liver injury in the State of DE, a state that is demographically similar to the U.S. This is an important
study to provide context to the importance of HILI pharmacovigilance."
10890850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease that is refractory to current treatment strategies
due in part to adaptive mechanisms of chemoresistance. Racial health disparities also confound the treatment
and care of these patients. Blacks have significantly higher incidence rates of PDAC and decreased survival
times compared to Whites and Latino/Hispanics (L/H) even after socioeconomic status and tumor stages are
controlled. Therefore, it is likely different racial groups exhibit unique molecular characteristics in PDAC tumors
that contribute to these health disparities. The molecular characteristics that distinguish PDAC tumors between
racial groups have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets required to overcome the disparities. Indeed,
delineating the underlying molecular basis for health disparities in lung, breast and prostate cancers has led to
therapeutic advancements and improved patient outcomes. Similar breakthroughs for PDAC are possible and
needed for this deadly disease, but this field of research has not yet been adequately explored. We identified 4
distinct subtypes of PDAC (Metabolic, Progenitor-like, Proliferative, and Inflammatory) that can be distinguished
using multivariate analysis of quantitative mass spectrometry data. These PDAC subtypes are predictive of
therapeutic response, but this has not yet been analyzed in a racially diverse population. We have examined the
proteomes of primary PDAC tumors using quantitative mass spectrometry and identified unique protein
signatures for Blacks, L/H, and Whites. In PDAC tumors from Black patients, we observed features consistent
with the Inflammatory subtype of PDAC, which is characterized by an inflammatory microenvironment and
resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, it is possible that race influences subtype and Blacks could preferentially
develop the more aggressive and treatment refractory Inflammatory subtype. Therefore, strategies are needed
to modulate subtype to improve response to chemotherapy. Toward this goal, our proteomic analysis also
identified that the polycomb repressor complex 1 protein RNF2 is upregulated in PDACs from Blacks compared
to Whites. We have also discovered that RNF2 regulates mRNA expression of the PDAC subtype specification
factor GATA6 and inhibiting RNF2 promotes a molecular shift toward the more chemosensitive Classical subtype
of PDAC. In general terms, the Specific Aims in this proposal are designed to: 1) Determine the interaction
between race and PDAC subtype development in PDX models; 2) Determine the impact of RNF2 on EZH2
regulation of GATA6 and in diverse PDAC PDX models; and 3) To quantify the response of PDAC PDX to select
NCI-IND compounds targeting epigenetic modifiers. The successful completion of these aims has the potential
to mitigate racial health disparities in PDAC and broadly improve overall patient survival by optimizing precision
therapeutic strategies."
10925354,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss. This vision loss is largely preventable through timely
diagnosis and treatment. The current method for identifying eyes at risk relies on qualitative evaluation of key
features on clinical examinations or fundus photographs. While this approach stratifies risk, it does so
imprecisely, requiring referral of many patients in order to identify the few who need treatment. We propose an
alternative approach that focuses on the direct precursors of vision-threatening complications using advanced
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). This approach has the potential to more precisely identify
patients at high risk for these complications than photographic screening, reducing the burden on the system.
Our preliminary data has identified OCTA precursors of the vision-threatening DR complications: proliferative
diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and center-involved diabetic macular edema (CI-DME). To use these biomarkers in
real clinical settings, OCTA must have a wide field of view with high resolution while also providing a high imaging
yield. In addition, these biomarkers must be accessible to clinicians, requiring automated and reliable
identification and segmentation. The currently available systems fall short of these requirements. We propose
making fundamental technological improvements to address the present limitations and to test our hypothesis
that the OCTA precursors of PDR and CI-DME can precisely identify eyes at risk:
In Specific Aim 1, we will develop a high-speed (1-MHz), wide-field (120?), and high-resolution (10-µmtransverse
resolution) system capable of reliable, high-yield OCTA from a single scan that does not require montaging or
eccentric fixation. This field of view is comparable to currently available ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography.
GPU-based real-time processing will reduce motion artifacts and improve scan acquisition reliability.
In Specific Aim 2, we will develop deep-learning algorithms that identify these precursors. The precursors of
neovascularization (pNV) are epiretinal hyperreflective material with flow signal above the internal limiting
membrane that are invisible with conventional imaging. Active microaneurysms (aMA) are characterized by
hyperreflective walls with flow signal within the lumen. We will use deep-learning techniques to accurately
segment and quantify these features and present the biomarkers in intuitive and interpretable format in real time.
In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the clinical significance of advanced-OCTA derived biomarkers. (1) In a 2-
year prospective study, we will follow 100 patients with moderate to severe nonproliferative DR at baseline for
development of PDR or CI-DME. (2) In a cross-sectional study, we will compare the sensitivity for detecting
neovascular lesions in 50 eyes with severe NPDR and PDR using the advanced OCTA vs. ultra-widefield
fluorescein angiography vs. fundus photographs. (3) In an exploratory study, we will follow 50 patients
undergoing treatments for PDR or CI-DME with advanced OCTA for 6 months to see if the advanced-OCTA
biomarkers can provide clinically meaningful information to monitor or predict treatment response."
10917255,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application aims to investigate the regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1A by HIF-
prolylhydroxyalses (PHDs) during acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is an extreme
inflammatory response of the lungs triggered by injury or infection. In surgical patients, ARDS can occur after
major surgery and causes dramatic increases in morbidity and mortality. Moreover, ARDS profoundly impacts
patients with infections or sepsis, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic. However, only a minor percentage
of patients who undergo major surgery or who have lung infections go on to develop ARDS. Therefore, we
hypothesized that endogenous adaptive responses exist to protect the lungs from developing severe
inflammation causing ARDS.
 Previous studies from our laboratory identified alveolar-epithelial expressed HIF1A as an endogenous
feedback signal controlling excessive alveolar inflammation during ARDS. The current application is focused
on examining the ""upstream"" regulation of HIF1A by PHDs. During hypoxia or ARDS, PHDs are inhibited,
thereby promoting the stabilization of HIFs. Three PHD iso-forms are known (PHD1-3). Our preliminary studies
indicate that PHD1 is the most abundant PHD in the lungs. Studies using mechanical ventilation to induce
ARDS revealed selective repression of Phd1. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition of Phd1 or genetic deletion
(Phd1-/- mice) is associated with attenuated lung injury. Moreover, mice with alveolar deletion of Phd1
(Phd1loxp/loxp SPC CreER+) are protected during ""conventional"" ARDS or infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
A screen for miRNAs that mediate PHD1-repression pointed us towards miR-15a/16. Indeed, miR-15a/16 is
transcriptionally induced by HIF1A and effectively represses PHD1 during ARDS. In addition, overexpression
of miR-16 provides lung protection in conjunction with PHD1 repression and enhanced HIF1A stabilization.
Thus, we hypothesize that miR-15a/16-dependent repression of PHD1 and concomitant enhancement
of HIF1A stabilization functions in an endogenous feedforward loop critical for attenuating alveolar
inflammation during ARDS. We designed four aims to address this hypothesis, including Aim1, which is
focused on the interaction of miR15a/16 and PHD1, including proof-of-principle studies in patients with ARDS.
In Aim 2, we will pursue in vivo studies in conventional ARDS models. In Aim 3, we are extending our studies
towards in vivo models of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS using our BSL-3 laboratory at UTHealth. In Aim 4,
we will explore therapeutic strategies targeting the miR-15a/16-PHD1 pathway for ARDS treatments.
Successful completion of these studies will give us the scientific foundation to move forward with clinical trials
targeting individual PHDs or miR-15a/b towards the prevention or treatment of ARDS in surgical patients or
patients experiencing pathogen-associated ARDS, such as during COVID-19."
10931663,"Up to 40% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with locally advanced pancreas cancer (LAPC), defined as
localized (non-metastatic) but unresectable. Treatment of this patient subset is a particularly glaring unmet need.
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a technique that is being used increasingly for ablation of persistent LAPC
after systemic therapy. Our group has demonstrated that IRE can function as an ""in situ vaccine"" by releasing
tumor neoantigens in the setting of inflammation and thereby promoting recognition of the tumor by the innate
immune system. CD40 is an immune receptor located on antigen-presenting cells that serves as a bridge
between the innate immune system and the host’s specific response to neoantigens (the adaptive immune
system). Using immunocompetent orthotopic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we have shown that the
combination of IRE with local delivery of a CD40 agonistic antibody (CD40 Ab), can both improve the local effects
of IRE and decrease metastatic disease in the liver. ADC-1013 (mitazalimab) is a CD40 antibody that is currently
being studied in clinical trials as a systemic therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer. It has also been delivered
by local (intratumoral) injection into a variety of superficial and deep tumors. Local (intratumoral) delivery is
appealing in that it has potential to be more effective while decreasing systemic side effects. Intratumoral injection
is also feasible at the time of IRE, which is generally performed via an open surgical approach. We hypothesize
that local delivery of a CD40 agonist at the time of IRE in patients with LAPC will augment the systemic immune
effects of IRE, enhance local disease control, and ultimately decrease distant recurrence. We propose to
conduct a phase I study of intratumoral mitazalimab injection at the time of surgical IRE to determine a
recommended Phase 2 dose and establish preliminary efficacy for future studies. In parallel, we will perform
correlative studies to determine if this combination can generate immune responses to neoantigens identified
using an unbiased bioinformatic analysis pipeline of tumor biopsies. Our multi-disciplinary team is uniquely
qualified to conduct the proposed studies. Dr. White is a surgical oncologist at UCSD with clinical expertise in
IRE and whose laboratory generated the preliminary data. Dr. Wainberg is a medical oncologist at UCLA with
expertise in immuno-oncology clinical trials and specifically CD40 agonists. Subjects will be recruited from all
five of the University of California Pancreatic Cancer Consortium centers. Dr. Schoenberger, at the La Jolla
Institute for Immunology, will assist with neoantigen identification from human tumor samples and measurement
of immune responses in post-treatment blood samples. We hypothesize that this novel approach to the treatment
of LAPC will prove to be safe, and result in progression-free survival superior to that of patients previously treated
with IRE alone. With these data in hand, Drs. White and Wainberg will be well-positioned to design a larger multi-
center efficacy study for this large subgroup of understudied pancreatic cancer patients."
10889274,"Adolescents’ eating behaviors are influenced by their media environments. However, very little is known
about the food and beverage-related environment that adolescents experience on their smartphones.
Adolescents increasingly interact with the world through smartphone screens that are almost always with

adolescents’ food and beverage preferences, purchases and consumption must consider the nutrition-
related environment and behavior on their smartphone screens. Until now, a comprehensive view of life
experienced on smartphones has been invisible to researchers. We have developed a novel method for
capturing everything that appears on teens’ smartphone screens – a fully encrypted record of digital life –
by taking snapshots of the screen every 5 seconds the devices are on. The resulting sequence of
screenshots, including all words and images on the screen, constitute an individual’s screenome.
We will collect six months of continuous smartphone screenshots and three 24-hour dietary recall
interviews at baseline and after 2, 4, and 6 months, from a national sample of 300 adolescents age 13-
17 years, balanced between female and male, and at least 30% identified as racial/ethnic minority.
Aim 1. Describe the food and beverage environment adolescents experience on their smartphone
screens Using the text and images from smartphone screenomes, we will create the first comprehensive
description of the food and beverage environments being experienced by adolescents on their

beverage screenome features are associated with differences in dietary consumption.
Aim 3. Elucidate the within-person relationships between changes in smartphone food and
beverage screenomes and changes in dietary intakes. Leveraging natural experiments embedded in
the screenome data.
This study will provide the first comprehensive description of the food and beverage environment that

GSK3E functions as essential negative regulator of E-catenin, while E-catenin accumulation represents a central
oncogenic driver in cancer. In solid tumors, E-catenin forms complexes with TCF7-factors for transcriptional
activation of MYC1-5. In striking contrast to solid tumors, we found that B-cell leukemias and lymphomas are not
only exempt from activating E-catenin lesions but highly sensitive to E-catenin accumulation and critically depend
on its negative regulation by GSK3E-mediated degradation: Unlike other cancer types, inducible activation of E-
catenin in B-cell malignancies suppressed MYC-expression and rapidly induced cell death. Instead of the
transcriptional activator TCF7, our interactome studies in B-cell malignancies revealed that E-catenin formed a
repressive complex with lymphoid-specific Ikaros zinc finger (IKZF)6-8 factors. Instead of MYC-activation, E-
catenin assembled lymphoid-specific Ikaros factors and multiple members of the repressive nucleosome
remodeling and deacetylation (NuRD)9-10 complex for transcriptional repression of MYC.
GSK3E phosphorylates S/T-residues in E-catenin exon 3, to initiate E-catenin- degradation. To leverage
lymphoid-specific repressive E-catenin-complexes as previously unrecognized therapeutic vulnerability, we
examined GSK3E small molecule inhibitors. Strikingly, established GSK3E-inhibitors that are currently in clinical
trials for the neurological disorders and solid tumors, were effective at low nanomolar concentrations in B-cell
malignancies, induced massive accumulation of E-catenin, repression of MYC and acute cell death. Preclinical
experiments based on patient-derived xenografts validated small molecule GSK3E-inhibitors for targeted
engagement of lymphoid-specific repressive E-catenin-complexes to overcome drug-resistance in refractory B-
cell malignancies in vivo.
Based on this discovery, the central goal of this proposal is to repurpose GSK3E-inhibitors for targeted
engagement of repressive E-catenin-complexes in refractory B-cell malignancies. Given that four GSK3E-
inhibitors have already undergone full clinical development and demonstrated favorable safety profiles in
eighteen clinical trials, we anticipate that this powerful new approach can rapidly be developed to benefit patients
with refractory B-cell malignancies and be further extended to T-cell malignancies in the future. We propose two

to leverage targeted activation of E-catenin-Ikaros complexes for therapeutic intervention in refractory B-cell
malignancies."
10910120,"Project Abstract
Dry mouth is a significant side-effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer patients. Several factors
contribute to dry mouth. Decreased production of saliva is called hyposalivation. Poor quality and function of
saliva is called salivary dysfunction. Together, these cause xerostomia, or what a patient experiences as
simply dry mouth. Xerostomia can lead to tooth decay, infections, difficulty speaking, impaired swallowing, poor
nutrition, and has a significant negative effect on quality of life. Doctors recommend that patients suck on hard
candy, chew gum, use saliva substitutes, and/or carry a water bottle with them at all times. None of these are
particularly effective. Our long-term goal is to prevent the development of long-term radiation-induced dry
mouth to improve the quality of life for patients with head and neck cancer. We seek to achieve this goal by
providing convincing evidence that innovative cellular therapies can safely and significantly prevent the
development of long-term salivary gland dysfunction. The team of investigators tackling this project is uniquely
suited to complete the work. Success would lead directly to the next phase of clinical testing. We have
expertise in caring for head and neck cancer patients, developing minor salivary gland derived mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) as cellular therapies, and studying salivary function. The overall objective of this
application is to plan and prepare for a Phase 1 trial to test the safety and tolerability of IFN-g pre-licensed

Early screening and prevention of individuals at risk of complex diseases are important strategies for reducing
morbidity and mortality. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are the cumulative, mathematical aggregation of risk derived
from the contributions of many DNA variants across the genome. PRS are an emerging technology in the field
of disease risk prediction and have been shown to be correlated with disease incidence. While PRS have shown
great promise for complex diseases, current PRS models are overly simplistic and have limited predictive power
and clinical utility. PRS do not account for the effects of rare genetic variants or other risk factors (clinical,
environmental, social determinants of health) on disease risk. Rare variants generally have greater effects on
disease risk due to selective pressure, but only a small number of individuals carry any single rare variant. The
sparsity of rare variants makes it difficult to directly incorporate them into PRS. Additionally, while it is known that
clinical, environmental, and social risk factors also influence risk, few analyses have successfully integrated PRS
with these important non-genetic factors.
To address this issue, we will develop novel translational informatics methods that integrate clinical,
environmental, and genetic data to improve disease risk prediction. We will assess the clinical utility of these
integrated risk prediction models using cardiovascular disease (CVD) to evaluate the potential for translation to
clinical use. Based on the complexity of CVD, we hypothesize that a comprehensive range of risk factors along
with rare variants need to be incorporated into PRS to improve the risk prediction and maximize the clinical utility
of PRS for CVD.
To achieve our goal, our specific aims are: 1) To develop novel methods that incorporate rare genetic variants
into Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS); 2) To evaluate Integrated Risk Models that combine clinical, environmental,
and social risk factors with PRS; 3) To develop and evaluate deep learning models integrating genetic, clinical,
environmental, and social risk factors; 4) To translate our integrated models into the electronic health record
(EHR). If these specific aims are achieved, we will have a set of integrated models that can be used in
downstream clinical implementation programs to ultimately have a translational impact on disease treatment and
prevention. Using these novel computational risk prediction models for precision health, along with our EHR
integration approaches, will allow for the translation of integrated risk prediction into routine clinical care."

Reproduction in flowering plants depends on multiple male (pollen)-female (pistil) interactive steps to
deliver sperm, which are non-motile and transported as cytoplasmic cargos by the pollen tube through
several specialized pistil tissues to the female target for fertilization, leading to seed production. The
proposed research addresses key cell-cell communicative events in three distinct prezygotic (i.e. prior to
sperm-egg fusion) phases during the pollen/pollen tube journey in the pistil to enable fertilization. Long-
term efforts in our lab have set discovery milestones for the field and recently elucidated key molecular
players in each of these phases, providing critical advances and unprecedented opportunities for the
mechanistic dissection proposed here. The pistil supports pollen germination on its receptive surface, the
stigma, to produce a pollen tube that grows inside the transmitting tissue to reach the target egg-bearing
chamber, the female gametophyte located inside an ovule. Once arriving at the female gametophyte, the
pollen tube burst, releasing sperm for fertilization, producing seed. The pistil also set up barriers to ward
off unwanted mates or invasive disease agents, and to effectively prevent multiple pollen tubes from
penetrating the same female gametophyte to suppress polyspermy and ensure progeny health. We
discovered three related signaling modules, each critical for one the three prezygotic phases. Phase 1
supports pollen germination on the stigma. Phase 2 achieves two goals, one ensuring pollen tube integrity
until it reaches its target, the other ensuring single pollen tube entry into an ovule. Phase 3 occurs at the
pollen tube/ovule and pollen tube/female gametophyte interfaces. Interactions here induce bursting of
the first-arriving pollen tube in the female gametophyte and trigger a mechanism for a local polyspermy
block to further ensure against supernumerary pollen tube entry into an already penetrated female
gametophyte. These signaling modules are anchored by the pistil-expressed receptor kinase FERONIA
or pollen-expressed homologs, each partnering with a GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI (LRE)
or LRE-like GPI-AP1,2,3 (LLG1,2,3) to serve as coreceptors for peptide ligands called RALFs (Rapid
Alkalinization Factors). Here we propose experiments to elucidate how these signaling modules and
additional regulatory factors impact the molecular interactions, biochemical processes and cellular
conditions in pistillate cells to mediate success for these prezygotic phases, enabling fertilization, and to
prevent unwanted intrusions. Plants have evolved but hidden in the most protected location these highly
sophisticated cell-cell communication strategies to ensure their own proliferation. Our expertise positions
us uniquely capable of achieving these goals, which will fill a complete mechanistic void, setting
paradigms to guide studies in many ecologically and agriculturally important plants, and inform rational
designs to safe-guard reproductive success, ensuring food security to provide for global nutritional needs."

When communicating face-to-face, humans receive information in two sensory modalities: visual information
from the face of the talker; and auditory information from the voice of the talker. The pandemic has brought
into sharp focus the importance of audiovisual speech: mask wearing obscures the talker's face while muffling
the voice, a double whammy that hinders communication. The popularity of video conferencing software
attests to the importance placed by people on seeing a talker's face as well as hearing their voice. Although
audiovisual speech perception is very important, we know little about the neural mechanisms for this uniquely
human ability. We will remedy this gap in knowledge using most powerful techniques in human neuroscience:
computational modeling; behavioral studies; ultra-high-field (7 tesla) functional MRI (fMRI); and the
examination of epilepsy patients who have electrodes implanted in their brain for the treatment of medically
intractable epilepsy, a technique referred to as intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG). The anatomical
focus of the proposal is the posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (STS/G), known since the time of
Wernicke to be important for speech perception. The behavioral focus of our proposal is the new discovery that
a classic audiovisual speech illusion, known as the McGurk effect, can produce dramatic, long-lasting changes
in auditory-only speech perception, turning a ba into a da. This phenomenon, termed fusion-induced
recalibration (FIR), provides a tool to advance computational and neural studies of speech perception. The first
aim will develop computational models of speech perception and test against behavioral data. Different models
will be fit to speech perception data before, during and after exposure to the McGurk effect. Fitted models will
be compared using held-out behavioral data. Because the models instantiate different theoretical constructs,
model comparison will determine which explanatory constructs are essential. These results will provide a solid
theoretical grounding for future studies, including those in Aims 2 and 3: searching for a neural correlate of an
unjustified construct is likely to be fruitless. The second aim will examine speech perceptin through the lens of
patterns of activity in STS/G measured with 7 tesla fMRI. We expect to observe reliable changes in STS/G
response patterns before and after exposure to the McGurk effect, reflecting modification of speech
representations (in contrast, in cortical areas driven solely by acoustic features, McGurk exposure should not
change fMRI response patterns.) The third aim will use iEEG to record broadband high-frequency activity
(BHA) from small populations of STS/G neurons with high temporal resolution. Responses to the auditory-
only component of the McGurk speech (but not control speech) are predicted to show sustained decreases after
successive blocks of audiovisual McGurk exposure, in lockstep with the perceptual development of FIR."

Congenital heart disease is the result of abnormal development of discrete sub-types of cardiogenic cells during
early embryogenesis, and is the most common of all human birth defects. The recently developed ability to
analyze the transcriptional and epigenetic state of thousands of individual cells at a time makes it tractable to
discern the consequences of genetic alterations on small subsets of cells that could lead to congenital heart
defects (CHDs). Nearly 30% of all CHDs involve the developing valvuloseptal region, but the mechanisms
underlying valvuloseptal development are incompletely understood. Trisomy 21, the cause of Down Syndrome,
offers an opportunity to investigate the genetic basis of valvuloseptal defects, as 50% of Down Syndrome children
have CHD, and it is the most common known genetic cause of atrioventricular (AV) septal defects and other
defects of septation. However, which of the 241 genes on Ch21 are responsible for causing cardiac defects
when present in three copies remains unclear. A minimal critical region containing 148 duplicated syntenic genes
sufficient for recapitulating cardiac defects in mice has been established (Dp1Tyb). Using our single cell RNAseq
atlas of mouse cardiogenesis, we found only 66 of the 148 genes present in the Dp1Tyb region were expressed
during cardiac development, and we defined cardiac cell types with greatest transcriptional and epigenetic
changes in the Dp1Tyb mouse model. Furthermore, we differentiated a human trisomy 21 iPS cell line and its
isogenic disomic iPS control toward the cardiac lineage, and observed substantial single cell transcriptional and
epigenetic dysregulation in trisomic AV myocardial cells. We engineered the disomic human iPS cell line with a
CRISPR-based gene activation system, introduced guide RNAs to moderately activate the 66 candidate genes
on Ch 21, and used a machine learning approach to identify thirteen Ch21 genes that shifted the transcriptional
signature in the AV myocardium to be more similar to that observed in trisomy 21 cells. Among these were 5
transcription factors, including BACH1 and HMGN1. In parallel, scATACseq analysis of trisomy 21 AV myocardial
cells revealed a dramatic increase in motifs for the transcriptional repressor BACH1 among more closed
chromatin regions. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the cardiac defects of Trisomy 21 arise due to the
presence of three copies of one or more of the 13 genes identified in our pooled CRISPR screen, and that
increased dosage of one or more transcription factors, such as BACH1 or HMGN1, alters AV myocardium to
contribute to such defects. To test this, we propose to: 1) identify trisomy 21 gene(s) duplicated in Down
Syndrome that are necessary and sufficient for modulation of iPS-derived AV myocardium; 2) determine the
mechanism by which transcription factors from our screen affect transcriptional and epigenetic signatures in AV
myocardium; and 3) determine the in vivo dose dependency of candidate genes in the mouse Down Syndrome
region on cardiogenesis. Execution of this proposal will reveal the critical gene(s) that cause cardiac defects in
Trisomy 21, and provide insight into the mechanisms that drive CHD more generally."

While current antiretroviral therapies (ART) are able to control HIV replication, they are unable to fully restore
health or a normal immune status. ART-treated individuals still experience several co-morbidities including
increased cardiovascular disease, bone disorders, and cognitive impairment. Most importantly, therapy
interruption leads to the re-emergence of viral replication and progression to AIDS. Therefore, new approaches
aimed at eradicating or functionally curing HIV infection are desperately needed. An under-studied strategy to
eliminate latently infected cells after viral reactivation relies on the ability of immune cells to mediate antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). The RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial in Thailand elicited a 31.2% protective
efficacy, making it the first vaccine trial with any level of success in generating a protective response. Subsequent
analyses indicated that this modest protection was correlated with the generation of antibodies (Abs) with high
ADCC activity, in the presence of low plasma IgA Env-specific Abs. This suggests that ADCC may have
contributed to the protection observed in the RV144 trial. But key unanswered questions exist that prevent
researchers from specifically triggering the ADCC response with novel treatments or immunogens: Why did the
RV144 trial generate such a strong ADCC response? What about the CRF01_AE subtype of HIV-1, which
predominates the Thai AIDS epidemic, might make it especially susceptible to ADCC? Does Env conformation
affect ADCC responses? Answering these questions will prove crucial to the design of improved strategies to
eliminate HIV-1-infected cells. The long-term goal of the research described in this proposal is to inform the
development of new strategies for utilizing the ADCC response to eradicate the HIV-1 infection. To achieve this
goal, we will begin by describing in molecular detail the Env conformations that are susceptible to attack by Abs
that induce ADCC, and to determine the structural elements of Env from distinct HIV-1 strains that mediate
transition to these conformations. Our central hypothesis is that Env has intrinsic access to downstream
conformations that are recognized by easily-elicited non-neutralizing Abs. Some of which, like the anti-cluster A
Abs, have potent ADCC activity. In support of this hypothesis, we recently demonstrated using Ab-binding
assays, cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), and single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET)
imaging that HIV-1 Env can adopt a conformation that is sensitive to attack by Abs that have potent ADCC
activity (State 2A). The rationale underlying this proposal is that characterization of the structure of Env State
2A, as wells as other conformations recognized by non-neutralizing Abs, and the elements that mediate
stabilization of these conformations will inform new strategies to eliminate the latent HIV reservoir."

gastroenterology clinics in Lagos, Nigeria, and determine under AIM 1 whether PBMC mtDNA content can
successfully differentiate active HBV+/HCC+ from CHB-infected patients and uninfected controls with a better
diagnostic performance compared to current methods. Under Aim 2, she will determine whether PBMC mtDNA
content can predict the severity of HCC in HBV-associated HCC and in CHB-infected patients. She will also
investigate any associated risk factors including age, gender, alcohol intake, smoking that may predict or
impact severity. In AIM 3 she will identify and evaluate the frequencies of mtDNA 4977 base pair (bp) deletions
in the PBMC of HBV-associated HCC, CHB-infected, and healthy participants and provide confirmatory pieces
of evidence through sequence analysis. This study AIM would be the first in Nigeria and sub-Saharan
Africa.The overall public health significance of findings from this study is the small tissue samples required for
analysis, the easy accessibility of peripheral blood for sampling, and the anticipated convenience and safety of
PBMC mtDNA as a screening tool which can provide the impetus for policy shift to advocate for early

Post-stroke agrammatic aphasia (PSA-G) is characterized by a cluster of symptoms (fragmented sentences,
errors in functional morphology, a dearth of verbs, and slow speech rate), yet extant theories and language
interventions focus on individual symptoms. This single-symptom theoretical and intervention focus results in
limited gains in functional communication. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the clinical
effectiveness of interventions for PSA-G. As a first step towards this goal, this project’s objective is to advance
the theoretical framework of PSA-G by addressing two critical gaps. The first gap is in the mechanistic
understanding of how lexical, grammatical, motoric, and cognitive processes work together to enable fluent
sentence production and how this breaks down in PSA-G. The second gap is in the understanding of neural
mechanisms underlying how sentence production planning normally unfolds over time and what crucial
spatiotemporal alterations give rise to PSA-G versus other variants of post-stroke aphasia with predominantly
lexico-semantic deficits (PSA-LS). The central hypothesis is that agrammatic language production results from
spatiotemporal alterations in the neural dynamics of morphosyntactic and phonomotor processes, causing a
cumulative processing bottleneck at the point of articulatory planning. This Synergistic Processing Bottleneck
Model of Agrammatism will be tested with two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate the relative contribution
of syntactic and non-syntactic processes towards sentence production in aphasia by using speed metrics and a
path modeling framework. The expected outcomes of this aim are an improved understanding of the extent to
which delays in different linguistic processes underlying the agrammatic symptom cluster impair fluent sentence
production in aphasia generally, and in PSA-G versus PSA-LS more specifically. Specific Aim 2 will determine
the neural mechanisms underlying sentence production across language deficit profiles.
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be used to compare alterations in timecourse and functional connectivity
of key perilesional and contralesional syntactic hubs across increasingly demanding morphosyntactic production
tasks. The expected outcome of this aim is a spatiotemporally specified neural model of sentence production in
neurotypical, PSA-G, and PSA-LS speakers. The significance this research is that it will forward an empirically
established multidimensional model of sentence production, which will lay the foundation for developing more
targeted and effective language interventions for agrammatic aphasia. It will also contribute to a better
understanding of agrammatism in neurodegenerative aphasias. The innovative aspects of this project include: a
novel multidimensional theoretical framework that incorporates non-syntactic dimensions of phonomotor
planning, processing capacity and speed, and neurophysiological dynamics; direct comparisons between PSA-
G and PSA-LS groups; and MEG analysis of spoken language with simultaneous electromyographic
measurement."

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by tumors that form throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition to tumors, ~80% of individuals with NF have neurological deficits including impairment of memory, attention, perception, and executive functioning. Previous work has established the importance of somatic mutations-post-zygotic changes to DNA that only exist in a subset of cells-for tumor formation in NF. Despite the critical importance of somatic mutation in NF pathogenesis and the deep study of particular mutations that drive tumor formation, the overall dynamics of somatic mutagenesis is poorly understood. Do individuals with NF have a higher burden of somatic mutations compared to unaffected individuals? Do infrequent somatic mutations in neurons contribute to the neurological deficits in NF? What genetic mechanisms drive the acquisition of new somatic mutations? To address these questions, I will use cutting-edge duplex single-nucleus whole genome sequencing to quantify the burden of somatic mutations in neuronal cell types in NF compared to age-matched controls and use the well-established method of unbiased non-negative matrix factorization to identify specific mechanisms driving mutagenesis."

10871906,"This proposal focuses on both cell autonomous and non-autonomous function of the nephronophthisis (NPHP) gene, Nphp2, in renal fibrosis and cyst formation. NPHP is a recessive renal ciliopathy characterize by interstitial fibrosis and cysts. Although NPHP accounts for a significant portion of end stage renal disease in children and young adults, currently no targeted therapy is available for this disease and the underlying molecular etiology, particular for interstitial fibrosis, is not well understood, even though NPHP proteins have been put into different modules biochemically. The lack of knowledge hampers the effort to develop targeted therapy for this disease. Previous work showed that mouse whole-body knockout model of Nphp2 displays renal fibrosis and cysts at the neonatal stage. By generating and analyzing epithelial and complementary stromal specific knockout mouse models of Nphp2, we pinpointed defective epithelial cells as the driver for both interstitial fibrosis and epithelial cyst formation. In addition, myofibroblast activation occurred early during disease progression and preceded detectable cyst formation in the epithelial specific Nphp2 mutants. Moreover, abrogation of cilia genetically partially suppresses the phenotype of Nphp2 mutants, suggesting that cilia play a significant role in Nphp2 function. The central hypothesis of this project is that Nphp2 inhibits a cilia-dependent profibrotic and pro-cystic pathway in renal epithelial cells and that both cell autonomous and non-autonomous responses contribute to disease progression. Two specific aims were proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 focuses on renal epithelial cells. A combination of approaches, from in vivo phenotype characterization, transcriptome profiling to pathway analysis to identify key pathways that are disrupted in Nphp2 mutant epithelial cells. Aim 2 focuses on epithelial-interstitial crosstalk and will determine how stromal cells respond to epithelial cells with defective NPHP2 and whether stromal cells modify phenotypes of Nphp2 mutants. Completion of this project will provide critical insight into the molecular and cellular etiology of NPHP and cilia-mediated signaling under diverse physiological and disease states."

The goal of this proposal is to define novel functions of STING in autoinflammation, cytokine secretion, and
immune dysregulation mediated by macrophages, innate lymphoid cells, and radioresistant cells. This work
builds on our prior discoveries using our model of STING-associated autoinflammation. The proposed studies
utilize several newly generated, already-validated model systems that will allow us to define cell type-specific
functions of STING in autoinflammatory disease pathogenesis.
STING gain-of-function mutations cause STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), an
autoinflammatory disease characterized by T cell cytopenia, interstitial lung disease, Raynaud’s, skin lesions,
vasculopathy, and up-regulation of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes. We previously generated a mouse model
of SAVI and discovered that the disease is mediated by type II IFN (IFN-γ) rather than type I or type III IFN. This
discovery was unexpected since type I IFN had been predicted to mediate disease. Additionally, we found that
innate lymphoid cell functions are altered in STING gain-of-function mice, and that macrophage activation
phenotypes and cytokine secretion are perturbed by constitutive STING signaling. We have previously
generated and published our floxed-STOP STING mutant mice, which permit cell type-specific expression of
STING. However, we have not yet studied cell type-specific functions of the type II IFN receptor and STING in
myeloid cells, innate lymphoid cells, and radioresistant cells in our model of STING-induced autoinflammation.
Therefore, we will define functions of the type II IFN receptor (Aim 1) and the effects of cell type-specific
expression of STING (Aim 2) in SAVI mice.
In unbiased, whole-genome CRISPR screening studies, we were led to the discovery that both WT STING and
STING gain-of-function can non-transcriptionally regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by altering the
post-Golgi endosomal pathways, and that this occurs without impacting secretion of other proteins. This function
of STING requires the protein ArfGAP2. Additionally, we found that ArfGAP2 deletion has no appreciable effect
on Golgi structure or on the transit of proteins from the ER to the Golgi when STING is inactive. However, when
STING is activated, cytokine trafficking and secretion is greatly diminished in the absence of ArfGAP2, and this
effect is non-transcriptional. We generated Arfgap2f/f mice crossed to transgenic Cre animals, and we found that
ArfGAP2 is deleted efficiently without impacting survival of target cells. In Aim 3, we will define the immunological
and physiological functions of ArfGAP2 in STING-mediated cytokine secretion and autoinflammation (Aim 3)."

Title: Understanding the mechanistic link between vascular dysfunction and Alzheimer’s disease-related protein
accumulation in the medial temporal lobe.
Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), which affects small vessels of the brain in the form of cerebral amyloid
angiopathy (CAA) or arteriolosclerosis, is either primarily responsible or a significantly contributing factor to
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). However, it remains unclear whether vascular pathology
and AD-related pathology independently contribute to dementia or causally interact with each other. Dysfunction
in perivascular clearance, one of the systems responsible for the disposal of metabolic waste products from the
brain, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, both occur when CSVD pathology is present and are candidate
mechanisms that could explain this interaction. The objective of the proposed research is to pinpoint the
reciprocal interaction between CSVD and AD-related pathology, in order to infer its underlying
mechanisms. The focus will be on the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a critical brain region for the development
of AD/ADRD, because it is fundamental for cognition and it is a site where a multiplicity of AD-related pathologies
coexist (e.g. Aβ-plaques, neurofibrillary tau tangles, TAR DNA binding protein 43, and neuronal loss), some of
which in very early stages of the disease (e.g. tangles). Firstly, the applicant will investigate whether CSVD in
the MTL worsens AD-related pathology (Hypothesis 1). Secondly, she will infer the contributing role of
perivascular clearance dysfunction and BBB-leakage to these interactions (Hypothesis 2) and aims to create
and validate neuroimaging markers of microvascular health in the MTL (Hypothesis 3). The innovation of this
proposal lies in the use of quantitative neuroimaging and neuropathological methods, including ultra-high
resolution ex vivo MRI, polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography, and deep-learning based measures
of MRI and serial histology. The proposed investigations address a significant knowledge gap, related to the
complex interactions between AD and CSVD, which has been emphasized as a research priority by the NIH.
Successful completion of the aims will result in histologically validated neuroimaging markers of microvascular
health of the MTL, which can be applied to in vivo studies to understand the impact of disease-modifying
interventions. This proposal leverages the candidate’s existing skillset and demonstrated expertise in vascular
pathology and will provide an invaluable training opportunity to acquire new skills and analytic methods. This
award will be instrumental for a successful transition into an independent investigator. Importantly, the support
of an internationally recognized team of (co-)mentors in human CSVD and AD and the unique resources
available at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School are key ingredients to ensure impactful
results."

Latinx childhood cancer survivors have an increased risk of cardiometabolic dysfunction. While physical activity
(PA) is associated with lower risk of cancer recurrence, cardiometabolic dysfunction, and higher quality of life,
57% of Latinx survivors are inactive. Culturally tailored interventions to increase PA for Latinx AYA survivors do
not currently exist despite their urgent need. We will address this critical gap by efficiently leveraging the
infrastructure in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG) created by our ongoing StepByStep randomized
controlled trial (RCT; U01CA246665) that investigates a mHealth PA intervention in AYA childhood cancer
survivors among English-speakers. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been successful in enrolling
patients from COG, conducting assessments and intervention components remotely. Because the U01
StepByStep RCT is limited to English speakers, we propose (1) to apply a cultural centering process for
behavioral interventions, using the general StepByStep intervention as a starting point, to create a novel
intervention and (2) to test the resulting culturally tailored intervention in a short term efficacy RCT. We will
efficiently extend our established study infrastructure within COG to recruit Latinx survivors who speak Spanish
and/or English. In response to PAR-21-190 (Modular R01), we propose the following Specific Aims:
1. Use an iterative approach to develop a novel, culturally tailored multilevel remote-based physical activity
 intervention among 20 Latinx AYA childhood cancer survivors whose preferred language is Spanish or
 English. The iterative process will combine 3 rounds of testing of the intervention components alternating
 with qualitative interviews to obtain participant feedback to guide intervention modifications.
2. Conduct a RCT to test the novel culturally tailored remote-based physical activity intervention to
 demonstrate efficacy over 12 weeks among a separate group of 160 Latinx AYA childhood cancer
 survivors whose preferred language is Spanish or English (n=80 per randomization arm) and who do not
 meet PA guidelines. The control group will receive a Fitbit only. We will test the following hypotheses (H):
 H1: Intervention participants will have greater increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA (primary outcome)
 than controls as assessed by accelerometry.
 H2. Intervention participants will have greater improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness and resting heart
 rate than controls as assessed by the 2-minute step test and heart rate monitor (exploratory outcomes).
 H3: Intervention participants will have greater improvements in global, physical, and social functioning and
 fatigue than control patients as assessed by validated self-report instruments (exploratory outcomes).
3. Conduct two rounds of post-trial qualitative interviews, n=30 for the intensive intervention phase and n=30
 for the maintenance intervention phase, to determine acceptability of and guidance on improving both
 intervention phases in preparation for a fully powered, longer term RCT."

Immunological control of mucosal barrier development and maintenance is a critical process, as imbalances in
immune sentinel activity can lead to skin, lung and gut inflammatory diseases. Central in the mucosal tissue
homeostasis are type 3 cytokine producing lymphocytes. Cytokines, cytokines receptors and master
transcriptions involved in tissue development and barrier fortification have been identified based on analyses of
loss of function models in human and mice. However, non-inflammatory factors that orchestrate the type 3
responses in tissues to assure proper immune reactions and prevent aberrant inflammation have not been well
characterized.
We discovered that oxysterols, a major class of cholesterol metabolites with established immunomodulatory
activities, are the primary positional cues for the stereotypical type 3 lymphocytes in the skin called Tγδ17 cells.
Ebi2 (encoded by Gpr183) is the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that senses specific types of oxysterols,
and is expressed on all type 3 cytokine producing lymphocytes. Increased dietary cholesterol enhances Tgd17
activity at the skin interface via augmented oxysterol production and sensing. However, how tissue resident cells
contribute to the anatomical framework that generate the final positional cues for dermal IL-17 secreting innate
T lymphocytes is not known. Moreover, whether oxysterols are involved in the development of skin-tropic Tgd17
and other type 3 cytokine producing lymphocytes is not known.
In this project we will test the hypothesis that Tgd17 cells maintain barrier tissue homeostasis by sensing cues
that reflect nutritional states and inputs from the peripheral nerve system. Metabolic changes in the epithelial-
neuronal niche in the skin control optimal microanatomical Tgd17 positioning and function via GPR183. This
integrated sensory mechanism for cholesterol metabolism and neuronal inputs is imprinted early in Tγδ17
thymocyte maturation through interactions with a novel subset of thymic epithelial cells programmed to produce
oxysterols. The conceptual basis of this project is innovative as there are no precedents for the oxysterol-
regulated mucosal tissue hub integrating epithelial-neuronal-immune communications critical for barrier tissue
fitness."

Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB), which accounts for ~20% of recurrent TB cases and is diagnosed in
400,000 patients each year, represents an urgent global health priority that threatens to undermine US TB
elimination strategies. Key to MDR-TB transmission is disruption and non-compliance with standard therapeutic
regimens, which are lengthy (up to 24 months) and require high daily doses of antibiotics. The goal of this project
is to develop an aerosolizable, narrow-spectrum antimicrobial biomaterial that can be paired with approved TB
antibiotics to rapidly clear pulmonary MDR-TB and dramatically shorten the course of treatment. Fundamental
to this strategy is a new class of protein-mimetic host defense peptides we have engineered de novo to undergo
instructed self-assembly within the mycolic-acid rich outer membrane of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We
have shown that our lead candidate, MAD1, elicits TB-specific bacteriolysis within minutes of exposure, without
collateral toxicity towards protective respiratory commensals and host lung tissue. Further, these novel peptides
synergistically enhance the activity of clinical antibiotics to achieve nanomolar anti-TB efficacy. However, these
synthetic peptides have pharmacokinetic liabilities that include rapid clearance and limited pulmonary
bioavailability, and there remain gaps in our knowledge regarding their mechanism of action when combined
with other drugs. The objectives of this application are to: (i) more deeply investigate the mode of action (MoA)
and drug interactions (e.g. synergy) of our lead compound MAD1 in Mtb, (ii) improve its ADME (absorption,
distribution, metabolism and elimination) properties and pharmacokinetic parameters through sequence
optimization and formulation into novel biomaterial aerosols, and (iii) determine the safety profile and efficacy of
lead formulations in disease-relevant preclinical models. We will accomplish these objectives over three aims.
In aim 1, artificial intelligence-guided structure-based sequence screening and recombineering assays will
optimize MAD1’s potency against Mtb and drug-resistant strains, as well as inform on MoA. Whole-genome
sequencing of resistant strains generated during these studies will characterize possible resistance mechanisms
and determine the resistance frequency. Aim 2 will develop inhalable formulations of MAD1 and antibiotics
utilizing our proprietary aerogel delivery system designed to exploit a key metabolic vulnerability of Mtb for rapid
and pathogen-specific pulmonary therapy. Combination bacteriologic studies will assess potential for synergy
towards MDR-TB and persister cells in macrophages. In aim 3, we assess the pulmonary pharmacokinetic
parameters of prioritized aerogel formulations with the goal of optimizing the lung bioavailability and
residence/clearance kinetics of the therapeutic carrier. We will evaluate the safety of therapeutic formulations
via a series of assays (histology, pulmonary function, immunogenicity) and assess in vivo efficacy in several
murine models of acute and chronic TB infection."
10732522,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health (the Center) at the University of Michigan (UM) is
building on five years of successful interdisciplinary collaboration and community engagement to further our
understanding of the critical risk that climate change, and resulting cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms
(cHABs), pose to freshwater ecosystems and human health. Increased precipitation, more powerful storm
events and warming waters all encourage the proliferation of cHABs, which now occur in all five Great Lakes.
This Center, led by a multi-institutional team of biomedical scientists, limnologists and community engagement
experts with an extensive history of working together, seeks to advance the work begun in Lake Erie, which
has experienced the most severe cHAB events in the last decade–including a 2014 episode that led to a
complete shutdown of the Toledo, OH, water supply. The Center’s four research projects will directly address
overarching themes prioritized by the COHH4 program. First, we will specifically resolve how climate change
influences the spread of cHAB taxa, development of blooms, production of toxins, and transport of those toxins
in the Great Lakes and in the atmosphere. Second, we will study toxins and mechanisms of toxicity, including
identification of emergent toxins and determination of health risks associated with airborne and waterborne
toxins. Third, we will develop new technologies for enhanced monitoring and forecasting; we will collaborate
with colleagues at NOAA and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) to integrate our
findings into state-of-the-art forecasts and other data products that reach a wide stakeholder audience. Fourth,
we will leverage an extensive network of community engagement vehicles in the Great Lakes, including the
Michigan and Ohio Sea Grants, public health departments, state and local agencies, the Great Lakes
Integrated Science Assessment (GLISA), and community science initiatives involving Lake Erie Charter Boat
captains and the U.S. Coast Guard. The Center’s Administrative Core is focused on supporting and
coordinating the four integrated research projects, a Community Engagement Core, and a Facilities Core, to
ensure progress toward the stated goals of understanding and translating climate change effects on cHAB
events and their threats to human health in the Great Lakes region."

The Bioinformatics Core is the primary data management and analysis arm of the UP-PDTC. Of note, the
Bioinformatics Core will include biostatistics, bioinformatic and data management. The Bioinformatics Core
enhances the productivity of the proposed project investigators, PDX Core and, eventually the PDXNet by
providing them access to a statistical/bioinformatics/data management team who possess expertise in study
design and conduct, and data analysis in patient derived xenotransplantation studies including the analysis of
genomic, proteomic and RNA sequencing data. Timely and in-depth collaboration ensures that the proposed
studies are designed, managed, analyzed, and reported to the highest standard and provide valid and robust
answers to the scientific questions that the U54 project seeks to address. Importantly, Bioinformatics Core
personnel will work with other experts in PDXNet to ensure a consensus of tumor and response measurement
which can be widely used across the network. The Core is located within the Department of Biostatistics,
Epidemiology and Informatics, and the Institute for Biomedical Informatics (IBI) at Penn Perelman School of
Medicine. The DBEI and IBI are interdisciplinary homes for faculty, staff and students specialized in biostatistics,
epidemiology, and clinical/bioinformatics research on campus. Furthermore, Dr. Long is a Professor of Biostatistics
and Director of the Biostatistics and Informatics Core for the Abramson Cancer Center. Through his roles, Dr. Long
has substantial experience addressing clinically relevant endpoints for pre-clinical studies which will be necessary
for development of XP2 trials using biomarkers to guide development of expected human Phase 2 trials. Dr. E. Paul
Wileyto is an experienced biostatistician with expertise in pre-clinical study design including tumor measurements
and appropriate study design. Dr. Taehyong Kim is Interim Director of Bioinformatics Core at the Penn Institute
for Biomedical Informatics with extensive experience in analysis of NGS data, RNA sequencing and other omic
data. This team has already contributed to definitions of tumor volume and growth in PDX models as well as to
planned XP2 studies in Projects 1 and 2. Importantly, a major role of the Bioinformatics Core will be studies of
tumor changes during serial transplantation. These studies will involve multi-omics analysis for Project Two and the
development of novel potential biomarkers using artificial intelligence. Project One will work closely with
Bioinformatics personnel to apply recently developed techniques to study leukemia cell phenotypic evolution using
deconvolution of RNA seq data using CIBERSORTx. This novel approach will help define leukemic cell
evolution in vivo to a degree never previously done."
10881943,"Summary
 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the most intensely studied of human malignancies. In recent years
there have been major advances in defining the molecular pathogenesis of AML and introduction of new
therapies. But the three-year survival rate remains below 50% indicating failures to make therapeutic advances
for the disease. In part, we believe that this reflects a failure to adequately use genetically defined PDX models
to develop new therapies targeted at molecularly defined subsets of the disease. As discussed below, although
the overall genetics of AML is complex, we and others have found that there are dominant oncogenes in AML
and that targeting of these oncogenes can induce therapeutic responses although not cures. Examples of this
approach include the use of FLT3 inhibitors for de novo and relapsed FLT3 ITD mutant AML and development
of IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors. In each of these cases, current therapy includes a choice of targeted therapies
which are active but not curative. This likely reflects the multi-variate molecular pathogenesis. To advance the
field, we have collected thousands of independent AML collections and characterized dozens of PDX models of
AML. These models have been widely used for studies of basic biology but here we propose to advance the
use of AML PDX modeling for therapy development. There are several obstacles to progress. First, there are
not widely available and well characterized AML PDX models defined by genetic alterations. To address this
concern, we have chosen to separate AML into 7 subsets defined by dominant oncogenes as recently done by
the NIH MyeloMatch study. Leukemia’s will be sub-classified based on mutations in FLT3, DNMT3A, NPM1c,
IDH1, IDH2, TP53 or KMT2A fusion protein (FP). Here we will characterize xenotransplantation of three AML
models for each of these seven sub-groups and specifically characterize the biology of serial transplant of AML
in the NSG mouse strain. Initial documentation of engraftment has already been completed for 33 of the 35
samples. In SA2, we will focus on performance of an XP2 study to direct ongoing clinical efforts. Two of these
sub-groups are defined by the presence of fusion proteins involving KMT2A (previously mixed lineage leukemia
or MLL) or Nucleophosmin (NPM) mutations (that cause cytosolic re-localization of the protein) (NPMc). Both of
these sub-types of AML require menin, an epigenetic co-regulator for pathogenesis and AML’s with either class
of mutations responding in pre-clinical models to Menin inhibition. Menin inhibitors are currently in Phase 1 and
Phase 2 human studies and early results suggest that these drugs, like other targeted therapies in AML, are
active but not curative. Recent results have suggested that enhanced differentiation of AML samples containing
KMT2A fusion proteins (FP) can be achieved by combining a Menin inhibitor with a KAT6A inhibitor. Here we
will use our characterized KMT2A FP and NPMc mutant AML PDX models to study the effect in vivo of targeting
both proteins in genetically defined subsets of AML."
10881945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Gynecological malignancies such as uterine cancers [e.g carcinosarcomas, papillary serous carcinoma, and
leiomyosarcomas (LMS)] and ovarian cancers [e.g low-grade serous and clear cell ovarian cancer] are a
significant cause of cancer mortality for women. These uterine cancer subtypes are aggressive with high
recurrence rates affecting more black women who are 2 times more likely to die from disease than white women.
These ovarian cancer subtypes are chemo-resistant with <10-20% of patients responding to standard of care
(SOC) platinum-based chemotherapy.
 Lack of effective therapies for these gynecologic cancers, is likely due to the lack of robust preclinical models
for research for these disease subtypes. My laboratory has developed a preclinical drug development platform
to identify new treatment options that exploiting genetic vulnerabilities in high grade serous ovarian cancers
(most common subtype) with the ultimate goal to move them into clinical trials for patients. We have developed
~140 PDX models with a >90% take rate, previously prioritizing high grade serous ovarian cancer. We have
demonstrated that PDX models and primary tumor cultures maintain characteristics of the patient’s original
tumor, including mutation status, gene expression, and clinical behavior. Furthermore, transplantation of patient
tumors orthotopically to the mouse ovary/fimbria or uterine horn emulates the natural progression of HGSOC
and EMCA, respectively.
 In addition, we have used this PDX platform to identify new drug combinations to overcome drug resistance
in PDX models and then move therapies into clinical trials based on our results. After demonstrating combination
PARP and ATR inhibition reverses PARPi resistance in BRCA mutant PDX models, we validated these findings
in the clinic in BRCA mutant HGSOC patients showing a 50% response rate for PARPi (olaparib) with ATRi
(ceralasertib) in PARPi resistant disease (NCT03462342). Our ultimate goal is to develop new effective
treatments for these less common subtypes of gynecological cancers addressing a clinically unmet need. We
propose the following project Aims: Specific Aim 1: Develop and molecularly characterize orthotopic PDX and
organoid models from gynecological cancers lacking therapies. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate a novel combination
therapy in TP53 wild type gynecological cancer organoids and PDX models.
 These studies will ultimately provide molecularly characterized preclinical models, for ovarian and uterine
cancer subtypes, currently lacking in vitro and PDX models. These models will be shared with the scientific
community to expedite drug development in these rarer but deadly gynecological cancers. In addition, we will
validate preliminary in vitro studies showing synergistic activity of a new combination therapy, in already
established PDX models. Studies may support moving a new drug combination into clinical trials through CTEP
and NRG Oncology."

The goals of the Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core of the UP-PDTC focus on two priorities.
First, the Core will promote and support new Pilot Projects with high scientific merit and innovation that will
strongly impact PDX model development research and/or have the potential for translation to the clinic. The
Core will specifically act as a focal point and resource to bring new ideas, technologies, interventions, and
researchers into the UP-PDTC and the PDXNet. Second, the Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Core will
prioritize and facilitate novel projects that can add to the translational capabilities of the PDXNet. Key criteria
for project selection will include 1) high expected impact; 2) translational potential that may eventually be
integrated into full projects within the UP-PDTC or PDXNet; 3) innovative ideas and approaches that generate
new hypotheses and preliminary data; 4) collaborations to develop novel research and research tools, 5) high
risk/high return projects that move basic science and/or clinical interventions and 6) development of tissue
collections that address cancer disparities. Although the UP-PDTC will be a T-PDTC, we acknowledge and
highly support the latter goal. Pilot project grants will be competitively financially supported by the Core budget
and the PDX Core personnel will work with Pilot Project PI’s to develop application to the TransNetwork
program and/or for specific R01 applications. Solicitations for Core projects are made within the University of
Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center. Specific efforts will be made to recruit Pilot Project applicants from
underrepresented minorities (URM), women, and individuals with disabilities. The UP-PDTC Administrative
Core will assist in implementing a coordinated process for review, selection, and monitoring Pilot Projects,
ensuring that UP-PDTC resources are used effectively to expand PDX modeling, interactions with the PDXNet
and PDXNet research. The influx of research from new PDX modelers and investigators, or from those with
expertise outside of the most common tumors, will foster innovative new directions and complement ongoing
efforts in the UP-PDTC and PDXNet."

advancing the science of marine contaminants and seafood security
Abstract
The overarching goal of the proposed Scripps Center for Oceans and Human Health (SCOHH) is to advance
the science and community engagement surrounding seafood pollutants in a rapidly changing planet. The project
brings together a multidisciplinary team of biomedical and oceanographic researchers with broad expertise in
fish ecology, microbiology, marine chemistry, climate modeling, technology development, bioaccumulation,
genomics, toxicology, and public health. This team will study and track the distribution of essential micronutrients
and harmful contaminants in marine food webs to the three billion people who consume seafood globally, the
roles that the marine microbiome play in their production and transport, and the developmental toxicity of seafood
pollutants and their interactions with human drug transporters. The Center’s scientific goals and focus are guided
by the needs of society, established through bidirectional community engagement led by a proven community
engagement team. The proposed research program of SCOHH spans four main areas which address the
objectives of the NIEHS and NSF sponsored COHH4 program RFA:
1. Climate change impacts on the human intake of seafood micronutrients and contaminants.
2. The marine microbiome as a source for the synthesis, transformation, and distribution of seafood
contaminants.
3. Mechanisms of bioaccumulation and developmental toxicity of seafood pollutants.
4. Seafood risks and benefits – Science, literacy, and engagement.
We expect the overall outcome of SCOHH to better inform policies, consumption guidelines, and individual
decisions to lower risk and enhance greater benefits associated with seafood consumption by bridging science
discovery, environmental health literacy, and community engagement."

10733142,"CEC – Project Summary
While significant scientific progress is being made in understanding interactions between ocean contaminants
and seafood, the links to human health have been less clear and information for many contaminants is lacking
or unclear. This dilemma can leave people uncertain of what to recommend or eat, potentially to the detriment
of good health. Needed is best science and direct engagement with the multiple stakeholder communities
surrounding seafood production and consumption, communities broadly defined as public health and marine
resource agencies, scientists, seafood harvesters and markets, and consumers (including public health
professionals, community based non-profits, schools, chefs, and the public). The goal of the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) for the Scripps Center for Oceans and Human Health (SCOHH) is therefore to
develop, implement, and evaluate a community based, multi-directional environmental health literacy
education and engagement program. The ultimate goal of this project is to protect the public by limiting their
exposure to marine contaminants and pollutants while highlighting the health benefits of consuming fish. This
will be achieved through increased environmental health literacy, including increasing our understanding of the
needs and barriers to accessing and using information about seafood, dialogue and participation with decision
makers and stakeholder groups, and ultimately helping people to make healthier informed choices around
eating fish. To help with this, the science will be translated in culturally-appropriate ways within the broader
context of seafood sustainability and safety, and disseminated widely for stakeholder use using an innovative
mix of communication tools, techniques and storytellers. The CECs specific aims are to: (1) Build capacity for
multi-directional dialogue and participation, including assembly of a Community Engagement Advisory
Team (CEAT) of representatives from seafood safety stakeholder groups (one member joint with SCOHH
External Advisory Committee (EAC)), listening sessions and development of engagement strategies; (2)
Implement strategic engagement programming including workshops focused on the science–public
needs–policy continuum for each SCOHH project, directed stakeholder engagement, seafood
contaminant/nutrition culinary education; and (3) Strengthen environmental health literacy by integrating the
results of the SCOHH’s and other relevant scientific research into existing and new targeted communications
materials, convening and participating in public facing events, and strategically increasing participation by
SCOHH in stakeholder and public facting events. The CEC’s outcomes will include lasting partnerships with
the CEC, SCOHH project scientists, and seafood stakeholder communities that will promote bi-directional
knowledge exchange, collaborative identification of research and outreach needs and priorities, and
co-development of tractable options for improving public health outcomes."
10733143,"Project 1 - Summary/Abstract
Marine biota accumulate both micronutrients and contaminants through complex dietary interactions that
transfer energy from primary producers to top predators, and subsequently to the approximately three billion
people who consume seafood globally. Climate change is actively reshaping the energy transfer and nutritional
composition of seafood by lowering the quality of seafood-derived protein and the amounts of essential
micronutrients in seafood. The reliance on seafood as a protein source is not geographically equal and the
social perceptions and best-available science surrounding the health benefits and safety risks of consuming
seafood are poorly understood. Seafood is the main source of toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
methylmercury (MeHg), and these two contaminants are the basis of most fish consumption health advisories
in the US. However, most risk-benefit analyses argue that fish consumption delivers strong health benefits
despite exposure to these contaminants. The interacting biogeochemical and ecological processes that govern
the accumulation of contaminants and micronutrients in fishes respond differently to environmental change,
resulting in seafood species and regions with differing accumulation levels across different temporal scales.
Recent work by the Schartup and Choy groups demonstrates how the tight connections between marine food
web structure and climate change govern the accumulation of MeHg and plastics in predatory fishes and their
prey. Many fundamental questions still remain as to how the interacting roles of diet, bioenergetics, and food
web structure dictate the transfer of contaminants and micronutrients through marine ecosystems experiencing
unprecedented levels of climate change. The proposed work will comprehensively assess how climate change
will shift the balance of human intake of increased contaminant loads and decreased micronutrient quantities in
seafood. We present three integrated project aims that comprise a science-based inquiry into the nature of
marine ecosystem linkages to climate change, informing public health and contaminant science surrounding
the human intake of both the beneficial and the harmful components of seafood.
The proposed work will be undertaken jointly by the labs of Schartup (marine chemistry and biogeochemical
modeling) and Choy (food web ecology and biochemical tracers), who both have strong track records of
collaboration and innovation in these areas. Project 1 will leverage the expertise of diverse collaborators in the
acquisition of field specimens (fish stomachs, tissues, prey samples), the facilitation of quality contaminant and
micronutrient analyses at SIO, and in model improvements. Project Leaders Schartup and Choy will also
interact closely with the other Center investigators by co-utilizing ecologically diverse fish samples from
different geographic locations, examining the chemical composition and microbial transformations of persistent,
bioaccumulative and toxic pollutants (Projects 2 and 3), sharing our science with the public, and building
sampling capacity through relationship building with community fishers (Community Engagement Core, CEC)."

The United for Health Equity-Living PDX Program (U4HELPP) seeks to develop >500 new patient-derived
xenograft (PDX) models of cancers originated from the breast, pancreas, colon, liver, lung, and other advanced
peritoneal cancers. These PDXs will be made from >60% of patients from underrepresented populations which
our safety-net clinical system serves. To develop such a large number and diverse set of PDXs, we have enlisted
the support of a set of surgeons that specialize in each cancer type. Once extracted, the tumors are immediately
provided to the U4HELPP PDX Core which functions to propagate, distribute, and cryopreserve them.
Successfully generated PDXs will be subjected to genomic characterization and quantitative ancestral profiling
by the U4HELPP Bioinformatics Core so that we can better understand how ancestry contributes to genetics
and responses to targeted therapeutics. The PDXs will be provided to two Research Projects, that will focus on
either pancreatic cancer or breast cancer. The Pancreatic Cancer project will generate large-scale proteomics
insights from over 200 PDXs to refine subtypes of the disease and identify more effective therapeutics from Black
and White patients. The Breast Cancer project will utilize 20 PDXs that are Basal-like breast cancers,
characterize their metastatic profiles, define proteogenomic pathways that mediate metastatic growth, and target
metastases with synergistic investigational new drug combinations. The information from these PDXs and
Projects will be shared with the U4HELPP Pilot Projects and Trans-Network Activities Core which will award Pilot
Project grants to utilize the PDXs generated by us and our partnering PDXNet institutions. All of the PDXs and
insights gained will be shared with the NCI with the goal of reducing cancer disparities. Through this team effort
we are confident that we will be able to develop these unique resources and generate significant preliminary
data that will support investigator initiated clinical trials at the Massey Cancer Center."

Breast cancer is diagnosed in 1-of-8 women and is the most common type of cancer diagnosed at VCU. There
are several genetically distinct subtypes of human breast cancers defined largely based on proliferative status
and expression of targetable receptors such as estrogen receptors and the HER2 oncogene. The majority of
the cell lines and PDX models used for breast cancer research arise from White patients of European
Ancestry, however, all ancestral groups are affected by breast cancers. Over the past twenty years, there has
been a clear disparity identified in the subtype of breast tumors found based on genetic ancestry, with Black
patients being diagnosed more frequently with Basal-like Triple-Negative Breast Cancers, which are highly
metastatic. Therefore, in these studies, we are (1) focused on developing PDX models from breast cancer
patients. With these models we will (2) quantitatively determine their genetic ancestry and then (3) select
models that are genetically Basal-like and obtained from Black patients so that we can (4) use these models to
determine the organs that the colonize, (5) determine the genomic and proteomic profile of the tumors and
metastases, (6) define efficacy of NCI-INDs of interest, with a focus on selinexor based drug combinations on
cells obtained from the PDXs, and (7) identifying new therapeutic drug combinations that are effective in the
metastatic setting. At the conclusion of these studies, we may have identified a new effective two-drug
approach that could be useful for Basal-like patients that have exhausted the current standard-of-care
approaches for treatment of metastatic breast cancer."
10929553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the bioengineered human corneal endothelial cell (hCEC) monolayer graft have shown vision
recovery in animal models, the hCEC monolayer do not integrate with the host cornea due to suboptimal and
non-tunable degradation of the hCEC-carrier biomaterial in the anterior chamber, which provide mechanical
support to the monolayer. Thus, whether the transplanted hCEC monolayer will integrate with the host cornea
following the complete degradation of the hCEC-carrier biomaterial and remain functional thereafter is
unknown. To validate the bioengineered hCEC monolayers, there is a clear need to develop a biomaterial that
has tunable-degradation rate in-vivo to evaluate the engraftment of the hCECs, and is mechanically strong so
that the biomaterial-film/hCEC-monolayer construct does not break during the transplantation. The previous
work of the team has established that the extracellular-topography cues can significantly modulate hCEC
responses. The preliminary work of the team has developed photodegradable hydrogel (pdGel), which can be
degraded in a tunable manner after transplantation, within hours to weeks, using tissue-penetrative light.
Accordingly, the objective of this proposal is to develop a nano-topography pdGel-hCEC monolayer graft,
evaluate monolayer integration with host cornea by tuning the in-vivo degradation rate of the pdGel, and
validate the hCEC-monolayer function in-vivo. It is hypothesized that the nano-patterned pdGel will enable the
growth of hCECs as a confluent monolayer, improve the hCEC monolayer function and stability by inducing the
deposition of native-like extracellular matrix (ECM), and the tunable photodegradation of the carrier will
improve the engraftment of the hCEC monolayer. The rationale for this project is the evaluation of the
engraftment of hCEC monolayer with the cornea and the function thereafter will validate the use of
bioengineered hCEC grafts for potential treatment of multiple corneal patients with one donor. Towards the
overall objective, in the first aim, the hCEC monolayer growth on the pdGel, photodegradation kinetics, the
biocompatibility of the degradation products, and the engraftment of the monolayer will be evaluated in-vitro
and ex–vivo. In the second aim, using a high-throughput topography platform, the effect of 253 unique pdGel
topographies will be evaluated on the hCEC monolayer functions to identify the optimum graft design. In the
third aim, the photodegradation rate will be tuned in-vivo using light exposure to evaluate its effect on the
hCEC engraftment. The proposed research is expected to be significant because it will validate the
bioengineered hCEC-monolayer graft technology using a new photodegradable biomaterial, and it will develop
new biomaterial and nano-topography platform that will have significant applications beyond ocular tissue
engineering. The proposed research is innovative because it, (1) uses two-photon lithography approach to
develop an innovative, high throughput nano-topography platform, and (2) leverages the photo-decomposition
liability of the cyanine dye to develop an innovative photodegradable hydrogel for hCEC engraftment."
10852935,"ABSTRACT
COVID exposed the critical need for new and improved treatment interventions for chemosensory (i.e. smell and
taste) dysfunction. Evidence indicates that COVID-related smell loss (SL) often endures well past recovery of
the initial infection and is highly associated with other long COVID neuropsychiatric symptoms including
impairments in mood, sleep, and cognition. To date, there are few interventions available to treat COVID-related
persistent SL and its related impairments. While smell/olfactory training (ST) has emerged as a widely
prescribed, front-line treatment for COVID-related persistent SL, rigorous study is required to determine its
efficacy in long COVID. Moreover, given that ST is a lengthy treatment, requiring 12 weeks or longer of training,
and is associated with slow improvement, non-compliance, drop-out, and modest effect size, additional study of
adjunctive methods to improve its efficacy and speed of recovery are warranted. Here we propose the first study
to investigate combinatorial trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) and ST in the treatment of post-COVID persistent
SL and associated deficits in mood, sleep and cognitive impairment. Our previous work suggests that TNS, an
easy-to-use and very safe form of non-invasive brain stimulation, increases olfactory sensitivity and has the
potential to improve other symptoms of long COVID including mood, daytime sleepiness, and attention.
Therefore, we will conduct a larger at-home, randomized, controlled trial of ST and determine whether TNS
enhances the effects of ST in adults with COVID-related persistent SL. Our primary objectives are 1) to determine
the efficacy of ST, compared to any natural gain in function, on olfactory-specific deficits (active ST versus sham
ST), 2) to determine the TNS-enhanced effects of ST on olfactory-specific deficits (active TNS+ST versus active
ST), and 3) to determine if TNS+ST, compared to ST, is also more efficacious in the treatment of other
impairments (i.e. mood, sleep, and cognitive) associated with both SL and long COVID. While this research is
focused on COVID-related persistent SL, the results will provide the necessary information to extend the study
and use of ST and TNS to address wider chemosensory dysfunction. This line of investigation has the potential
to make a substantial impact on how chemosensory dysfunction is treated and in turn significantly improve the
current standard of care."
10915582,"Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. T1D
therapies have largely failed in human clinical trials and thus an urgent need exists for targeting novel immune
pathways. We have exciting data showing that a TLR4/MD2 agonistic antibody (TLR4-Ab) permanently reversed
T1D in 71%, and had a significant clinical effect in 90%, of acutely diabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. In
our recent Diabetes paper, we showed that TLR4-Ab can mobilize and activate myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) in vivo, that suppress T cells and ameliorate acute T1D upon adoptive transfer. We showed that TLR4-
Ab induces TLR4/MD-2 sequestration in endosomes, unlike the canonical TLR4 agonist LPS (which cannot
reverse T1D); however, the mechanism by which TLR4-Ab reverses T1D remains unclear. We have now
produced anti-human TLR4 antibodies, allowing us to apply these findings to human T1D. Our combined
expertise in autoimmunity/T1D (Ridgway), molecular biophysics/Immunology (Herr) and human T1D (Dolan) is
well suited to perform these studies. We will pursue three aims: Specific Aim 1. Mechanism of reversal of T1D
by TLR4-Ab-induced MDSCs. TLR4-Ab endosomal sequestration may induce prolonged signaling via the
TLR4-mediated TRIF pathway, which protects from T1D (2015, Chervonsky et al.). We show that immobilization
of TLR4-Ab on a plate, which prevents endosomal sequestration, eliminated TLR4 signaling. Therefore, we
hypothesize that TLR4-Ab-induced TLR4/MD2 endosomal sequestration causes sustained TRIF endosomal
signaling that induces APCs to undergo MDSC maturation, inducing immune regulation and reversing T1D.
Specific Aim 2. Mechanistic role of Fc structure in TLR4-Ab reversal of T1D and cell suppression. While
antibody F(ab) structure determines specificity, the Fc region contributes to antibody function through receptor
binding and glycosylation. TLR4-Ab is an IgG3 isotype, which has the longest hinge region and increased
glycosylation sites. IgG3 antibodies also form cryoglobulins, impacting avidity and internalization. Our preliminary
data show that TLR4-Ab F(ab) and F(ab’)2 fragments elicit decreased NFκB signaling compared to full-length
TLR4-Ab. This shows a critical role for Fc structure in TLR4-Ab function. Therefore, we hypothesize that the
IgG3 Fc portion of the TLR4-Ab is critical to its tolerizing function and we will test this with immunological and
molecular biophysical approaches. Specific Aim 3. Testing therapeutic effects of a novel panel of human
anti-TLR4 antibodies on human T1D APCs Since the TLR4/MD2 pathway is strongly evolutionarily conserved,
we have developed agonistic human recombinant TLR4-Ab (hTLR4-Ab). We show here that these hTLR4-Abs
bind to, and activate TLR4/MD2. Our hypothesis is that hTLR4-Ab treatment will induce MDSCs from myeloid
precursors and that these huMDSCs will suppress human T-cell proliferation and activation. These studies will
characterize novel innate immune mechanisms by which TLR4-Ab treatment can reverse acute T1D, and our
studies on the novel human TLR4 antibodies are the first step in translation to human T1D."

The over-65 population is growing, and over 1/3 of aged people will experience a fall. Falls in
the elderly often result from frailty caused by muscle weakness, balance deficits, and gait
instability. Previously, these deficits were ascribed to declining muscle mass (sarcopenia),
however, simply increasing muscle mass does not necessarily rescue age-induced functional
deficits. The term dynapenia has been introduced to denote aging-induced loss of muscle
strength, which includes deficits in motoneuron excitability, motor unit recruitment, transmitter
release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and muscle mass and function. As such, it is
critical to fully understand the changes that occur within NMJs to identity new targets for therapy
development. Here, we propose to define heterogeneous changes that occur within the
transmitter release sites (active zones; AZs) within NMJs that underlying dynapenia in an aged
mouse model. Specifically, we will (1) use a combination of electrophysiology and a new optical
quantal analysis approach we developed to study changes in the control of transmitter release
within single identified NMJs during aging, (2) use a new super-resolution imaging approach of
the density and distribution of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels within single AZs and
compare these results with our single AZ optical measurements of transmitter release in
identified NMJs over the aging time course, and (3) use a realistic computer simulation to test
the hypothesis that age-induced changes in AZ voltage-gated calcium channel density and
distribution predict single AZ and whole synapse function at the aging NMJ. The results from
these aims will elucidate the detailed structural and functional changes that occur within
transmitter release sites (AZs) of aging NMJs over the time course of the dynamic alterations
that occur as dynapenia develops. This information will guide future studies aimed at targeting
these specific aging-induced changes with the goal of treating dynapenia."

 This application is in response to the NOSI of Promoting Fundamental and Applied Research in Inflammation
Resolution, in particular to NIEHS’ interest in inflammation resolution related to environmental exposure. It is
increasingly recognized that the immune response to an inflammatory stimulus involves specialized pro-
resolving mediators (SPMs) that orchestrate the lung’s return to homeostasis by resolving cellular and tissue
inflammation. However, little data in humans are available concerning the effects of PM2.5, a ubiquitous air
pollutant, on SPMs and inflammation resolution. This is in marked contrast to the large body of literature on the
proinflammatory response to PM2.5. Here we hypothesize that PM2.5 impairs cellular biosynthesis and kinetics of
SPMs, leading to compromised resolution of inflammation in the airway. As airway inflammation is a hallmark of
asthma, it is highly plausible but yet to be confirmed that individuals with asthma are less capable of resolving
pollution-induced inflammation. No data are available to support a sex-specific hypothesis on inflammation
resolution, despite the known sex-difference in proinflammatory responses to air pollution. Hence, we further
hypothesize the effects of PM2.5 on inflammation resolution differ between people with and without asthma and
between men and women. We propose to test these hypotheses in a translational study framework by
leveraging an existing panel study of air pollution health effects. Our approach comprises of ex vivo cell culture
experiments focusing on molecular mechanisms of SPM biosynthesis and resolution kinetics (Aim 1) and a panel
study aiming to examine SPM-PM2.5 relationships in vivo (Aim 2) and to examine potential SPMs mediation of
the PM2.5 effects on clinical outcomes (Aim 3). To maximize the translatability of the mechanistic findings in Aim
1, we will use primary airway epithelial cells collected from among the panel study participants and will use
composition-characterized PM2.5 collected in London, UK, where participants reside. In Aim 2 panel study, 40
participants with and 40 without asthma will be measured 4 times longitudinally for SPMs in nasal fluid and
induced sputum, representing the first portal of PM2.5 entry and the lung, respectively. Detailed personal PM2.5
doses and internal doses (biomarkers) of source-specific PM2.5 constituents hours to days prior to SPM
measurements will be associated with sputum and nasal SPM concentrations. We anticipate to see differences
by asthma and sex, respectively, in the time-concentration profile. In Aim 3, by leveraging the panel study’s rich
dataset on health outcomes of clinical relevance, we will examine the mediating effects of SPMs on the exposure-
outcome associations at the key time-points of inflammatory and resolution responses identified in Aims 1 and
2. Taking all together, we anticipate to link molecular mechanisms regulating SPM biosynthesis with resolution
kinetics and clinically-relevant functional and inflammatory responses to PM2.5. The study will generate real-life
data to better understand the role of SPM in resolving pollution-induced inflammation in the airways of asthmatics
versus non-asthmatics and those of men versus women.

 Our overall goal is to develop a fluid mechanics approach to studying tracer transport through tissue for
perfusion quantification in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is termed as quantitative transport
mapping (QTM). Current/traditional perfusion quantification in MRI and medical imaging in general is based on
Kety's method that assumes the same arterial input globally into all voxels in an imaging volume. This global
arterial input function (AIF) transgresses the local mass conservation at a voxel and requires the user to
choose an arterial region of interest (ROI) with the consequent perfusion value highly dependent on the ROI
choice, which is known as the AIF problem.
been
The AIF problem in Kety's method for perfusion quantification has
a major unmet challenge impeding perfusion quantification in MRI.The tracer concentration at the artery
entering the voxel is needed to address the AIF problem and can be estimated by following tracer transport
through the vascular space according to fluid mechanics, which is the proposed QTM. Accordingly, we propose
to develop QTM technology for MRI perfusion quantification, capable of processing all 3 major types of images:
dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) as in imaging ischemic stroke, multidelay arterial spin labeling (ASL) as
in imaging kidney transplant, and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) as in imaging breast tumor. We plan to
achieve this objective through the following three specific aims:

10852946,"Survival of an organism relies on its ability to navigate through a complex environment. During navigation, the
nervous system integrates spatial information from a wide variety of sensory modalities into a stable heading
direction. In insects, such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, this process takes place in the central
complex, a series of neuropil structures in the brain. A hallmark of the central complex is its columnar
organization, in which neuronal activity appears as stable bumps that correlate with changes in the organism’s
heading direction. The Drosophila central complex has been the subject of extensive anatomical and functional
characterization, which has revealed how sensory percepts are transformed through its various compartments.
However, the understanding of how neuronal activity in the central complex is translated into behavior is strictly
correlational. To establish a causal relationship between central complex activity and heading direction, a
thorough behavioral dissection is required. Further, the circuits that relay central complex activity to motor
command centers are still poorly understood. Our proposal details a comprehensive research plan to
optogenetically manipulate the inputs and outputs of the Drosophila fan-shaped body (FB), a key structure in the
central complex. These manipulations will reveal the contributions of the FB input and output neurons to
generating a heading direction. To achieve this, we developed a behavior chamber for tracking locomotion of
walking flies during optogenetic manipulations. We use this chamber to activate FB neurons in different sensory
contexts. Additionally, we will map how outputs from the central complex are routed to command centers in the
brain. To this end, we will employ various new configurations of trans-Tango, the transsynaptic circuit mapping
and manipulation technique developed by our laboratory. The first of these is trans-Tango(behavior), which
allows selective optogenetic manipulation of the postsynaptic partners of a chosen starting population. The
second is ds-Tango, a method for mapping neurons mono- and di-synaptic to a chosen starter population. The
final is retro-Tango, a transsynaptic mapping tool that works in the retrograde direction. Our studies will reveal
how spatial information of sensory cues is translated through multiple layers of circuitry to elicit the navigational
drive. Our results will, therefore, represent a key step forward in the knowledge of how the nervous system
transforms sensory information into behavior. Finally, our studies will reveal circuit motifs in insects that may be
conserved in mammals to perform analogous functions. Therefore, the circuits we describe in insects may
contribute to the understanding of spatial perception in humans, one of the first cognitive faculties impacted in
Alzheimer's disease."

The majority of deaths from childhood tuberculosis (TB) are in children not initiated on treatment, highlighting
the urgent need to prevent delays in diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of childhood TB is challenging, as
sputum-based testing is invasive and has low yield in children, and chest X-ray (CXR) is not routinely available
in high burden settings and requires trained readers. The World Health Organization (WHO) has therefore
endorsed TB treatment decision algorithms to reduce delays in timely TB treatment initiation among children
presenting to lower-level health facilities. However, TB treatment decision algorithms have uncertain accuracy
and available data suggest they are likely to have poor specificity in the absence of CXR. Artificial-intelligence
algorithms applied to lung sounds collected using a digital stethoscope (Lung AI) have the potential to enhance
detection of lower respiratory tract disease in children being evaluated for TB. The overall objective of the
proposed project is to evaluate whether Lung AI can improve the accuracy of TB treatment decision algorithms
for childhood TB. We hypothesize that Lung AI can improve specificity while maintaining the high sensitivity of
TB treatment decision algorithms. To assess this hypothesis, we will leverage 1) existing well-characterized
cohorts to evaluate novel pediatric TB diagnostics; 2) expertise in digital stethoscopes and the development of
Lung AI algorithms for TB; and 3) experience in assessing digital health tools in high TB burden settings. In Aim
1, we will examine the accuracy of new and current TB treatment decision algorithms using existing data
collected from three ongoing childhood TB diagnostic cohorts in Uganda, South Africa, and the Gambia. At the
same time, we will prospectively enroll children with TB symptoms in Uganda, perform a complete TB evaluation
to classify TB status per NIH consensus definitions, and record lung sounds using a wireless digital stethoscope.
In Aim 2, we will use these lung sounds to train Lung AI algorithms using deep learning models to identify lower
airway abnormalities in children in reference to standardized lung sound definitions and radiology CXR reads.
We will evaluate these models in an independent test set of children with TB symptoms and healthy children. In
Aim 3, we will create a Lung AI model to detect microbiologically-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed TB in children,
and compare its accuracy to 1) the best-performing TB treatment decision algorithm, and 2) a machine learning
model that combines Lung AI and clinical variables, in the independent test set. Completion of these aims will
determine the utility of TB treatment decision algorithms, while demonstrating the potential of a simple,
affordable, digital health solution at the point-of-care to support the early diagnosis and treatment of TB and other
respiratory diseases in children at lower-level health facilities."
10906169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondria are essential organelles that supply cells with ATP and metabolic building blocks, but also play key
roles as signaling hubs that orchestrate the immune response or cell survival. Mutations in mitochondrial proteins
impede development and cause diseases, such as neurodegeneration, and a decline in mitochondrial activity is
considered a hallmark of aging. To prevent such consequences, cells employ conserved signaling pathways that
detect and alleviate mitochondrial dysregulation. It is a major goal of this proposal to dissect the regulation of a
mitochondrial signaling pathway, the reductive stress response, which safeguards activation of the electron
transport chain (ETC) through sensing an invariant ETC byproduct, reactive oxygen species (ROS).
 The reductive stress response is built on a Cys redox switch: in healthy cells, Cys residues in FNIP1 are
oxidized, which stabilizes this protein and allows it to downregulate ETC activity. When cells run out of ROS,
however, the FNIP1 Cys residues become reduced and FNIP1 is recognized by the E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B. The
subsequent ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of FNIP1 removes this mitochondrial gatekeeper to re-
activate the ETC and re-supply cells with ROS. FNIP1 and CUL2FEM1B are therefore the sensory module of the
reductive stress response. Importantly, mutations in FEM1B that hyperactivate this E3 ligase cause syndromic
developmental delay, showing that tissue formation and homeostasis require tight regulation of the reductive
stress response.
 This proposal will dissect three crucial modes of regulation that ensure accurate reductive stress signaling.
We will first investigate spatial control of reductive stress signaling. As with all ubiquitylation reactions, FNIP1
modification by CUL2FEM1B takes places in the cytoplasm, yet how cells can modulate the oxidation state of the
critical FNIP1 Cys residues in this already reducing environment is unclear. We found that substrate and enzyme
of the reductive stress response are anchored on the outer mitochondrial membrane via the TOM complex, a
channel that connects the oxidative mitochondrial intermembrane space with the reducing cytoplasm. In our first
aim, we will dissect how this localization impacts reductive stress signaling. We expect that this work will reveal
a novel function of a membrane channel as an E3 ligase co-adaptor. Moreover, it will likely allow us to pinpoint
the source of ROS that mediate reductive stress signaling, thereby revealing a sought-after physiological role for
ROS in signaling.
 We will next focus on the regulation of reductive stress signaling by the cell cycle. ROS have long been
suggested to control cell division, and we had indeed found that hyperactivation of CUL2FEM1B inhibits proliferation.
This result implied that ROS control the cell cycle via the reductive stress response. In line with this notion, we
identified the cell cycle regulator RNF187, which promotes cell cycle progression downstream of growth factor
signaling, as an inhibitor of CUL2FEM1B. Our preliminary data suggest that RNF187 and CUL2FEM1B collaborate to
restrict another E3 ligase, AMBRA1, which drives cyclin D degradation and thereby prevents initiation of DNA
replication. In our second aim, we will dissect the mechanistic underpinnings of this E3 ligase crosstalk to reveal
how ROS signaling is integrated into the cell cycle program. We expect this work to explain how redox stress
can its exert negative consequences onto development or onto tissue homeostasis during tumorigenesis.
 While our first aims address physiological modes of regulation, we will finally develop methods to exert
pharmacological control over reductive stress signaling. As the reductive stress response tunes the ETC,
activating the reductive stress E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B provides us with a unique opportunity to increase ETC output
in pathologies driven by mitochondrial decline or inhibition. Moreover, because CUL2FEM1B acts on mitochondrial
surfaces, compounds that target this E3 ligase could be converted into localized proteolysis-targeting chimera
for more efficient and more specific focused degradation of pathological proteins. In our last aim, we will build
on our discovery of compounds that displace protein inhibitors from CUL2FEM1B,, thereby activating both FNIP1
degradation and ETC function. This work will lay the foundation for mitochondria-associated protein degradation
as a new modality to provide therapeutic benefit during aging or in neurodegenerative disease.
 Our proposal takes an integrated genetic, biochemical, and pharmacological approach to dissect the
regulation of the reductive stress response as a conserved mitochondrial stress response. This work will reveal
fundamental principles of redox signaling and may lead to the development of a new therapeutics that could
benefit patients of neurodegenerative diseases that currently have few, if any, treatment options."

Hypothalamic obesity (HO) refers to the substantial weight gain that often complicates hypothalamic brain
tumors. Children with this treatment-recalcitrant form of obesity have excess rates of metabolic sequelae
compared to otherwise healthy children with similar obesity, and later experience excess mortality related to
cardiometabolic disease. Our team has made important progress in recent trials. In our 36-week placebo-
controlled trial (ECHO, NCT02664441), participants receiving exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonist (GLP1RA), demonstrated a larger reduction in body fat than those receiving placebo. While these results
are encouraging, in 50% of participants, BMI did not decrease with exenatide, highlighting the need to address
treatment non-response. Another pharmacologic option tested by our team is intranasal oxytocin (OXT), which
has had success in our case studies and reassuring safety. However, in a recently concluded cross-over study,
we observed a nominal, not statistically significant, within-subject weight loss of -0.6 kg attributable to OXT as
compared to placebo (NCT02849743), but suggestions of benefit for anxiety and impulsivity. These trials
highlight our team's experience and our commitment to developing evidence-supported, individualized
approaches to address the problem of treatment non-response in HO. In future, we envision pursuing an
innovative sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design. A SMART is a multi-staged clinical
trial where at each stage, individuals are re-randomized to the next intervention based on accumulated
information about response to the previous intervention. HO is particularly suited to a SMART as non-responders
may benefit from alternative and/or combination interventions. Moreover, the SMART allows for the identification
of biomarkers, such as hypothalamic injury on MRI, to support optimal and efficient treatment planning. In this
pilot trial, our objective is to gather key preliminary data about phentermine/topiramate (Ph/T), a promising option
containing a sympathomimetic amine (Ph) combined with an appetite-suppressive epilepsy drug (T) that is FDA-
approved for “common” obesity but has never been tested in HO. The subset of individuals with HO who
experience hyperphagia or excess daytime sleepiness may benefit from the Ph/T-induced decrease in appetite
and increase in alertness. We will make preliminary assessments of safety, adverse events and dosing (Aim 1),
as well as efficacy (% BMI loss, Aim 2) in a 27-week parallel-arm double-blinded Phase 2 randomized placebo-
controlled clinical trial in 12-25-year-old individuals with HO, following the FDA-approved dose titration. We will
also measure the proportion of individuals who experience 5% or 2.5% decrease in BMI, explore effects of Ph/T
on body fat, eating, autonomic tone, and cognition, and will bank biological samples for future mechanistic
analyses. Semi-structured exit interviews with participants and caregivers will help to explain treatment response
or non-response, experience of adverse events, and impressions of trial participation. We will next design a
SMART to include GLP1RA, Ph/T, and/or other novel therapies like OXT alone and/or in combination for HO."
10906983,"Adopted folding of the RNA elements within the genomes of RNA viruses allows binding of host and viral
proteins and plays an essential role in host-virus interactions. However, the mechanistic insights on how these
RNA elements could sense the transduced signals from host cells are lacking for SARS-CoV-2. This project is
based on our recent discovery of a novel and structurally conserved RNA element within the ORF1a RNA and
S mRNA of SARS-CoV-2. Our studies showed that this element regulates the translation of viral proteins in
response to viral S protein-induced signaling in human lung cells. In prior studies, we identified a translational
silencing-dependent mechanism of controlling inflammation in myeloid cells. These studies showed that the
assembly of an L13a-dependent multi-protein RNA-binding complex (IFN-gamma-activated-inhibitor
of translation) or GAIT complex on the GAIT elements found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target
mRNAs causing translational inhibition. Our studies also showed the physiological importance of this
mechanism as an endogenous defense against inflammation. Importance of the GAIT-like elements in human
responses to coronavirus and other respiratory pathogens is emerging from the published studies by us and
others. Our preliminary work presented in this proposal shows that treatment of human lung cells with SARS-
CoV-2 S protein activates a DAP kinase-dependent signaling mechanism causing the release of L13a from
large ribosomal subunit followed by the formation of L13a-dependent RNA-binding complex on “GAIT-like” viral
RNA elements of SARS-CoV-2, thus inhibiting translation. This led us to name these
elements virus activated inhibitor of translation (VAIT) elements. Together, these studies lead us to
hypothesize that ribosome-released form of L13a upon SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes the assembly of RNA-
binding complex on VAIT element of ORF1a RNA and S mRNA, which is biochemically and functionally distinct
from IFN-g-induced GAIT complex. The role of translational inhibition caused by the VAIT complex is testable.
We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following two aims. Aim 1. To elucidate the composition of the
translation inhibitory VAIT RNP complex and identification of the upstream kinase in signaling. In this aim we
will use the combined approach of Gel filtration, RNA-affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to
identify the subunits of the RNA-binding complex. Small molecule inhibitors and siRNA of the potential kinases
will be used to dissect the signaling aspect. Aim 2. To test the virological significance of VAIT element
mediated translational silencing. In this aim we will use extensive mutation in the VAIT element of the S gene
within the viral genomic RNA of the trans-complementation system to test the role of VAIT element-mediated
translational silencing in the intracellular expression of viral proteins and nucleic acid. Mechanistic insights on
VAIT element mediated translational silencing of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs may provide novel targets of small
molecule intervention and facilitate the development of next-generation mRNA vaccines."

In this K23 proposal I detail a 5-year training plan that will launch my career as an independent investigator focused on developing and implementing mind-body interventions for cardiac arrest (CA) survivors and their families. Background: Experiencing a CA is continuously traumatic resulting in emotional distress in survivors (up to 61%) and their informal caregivers (up to 40%). Unlike other critically ill populations with established survivorship programs, CA survivor-caregiver dyads (pairs) are under-resourced and unprepared to manage survivorship, which exacerbates emotional distress. Untreated emotional distress post-CA becomes chronic and undermines clinical and quality of life outcomes. Addressing emotional distress early after CA by teaching mind-body skills and providing resources may prevent chronic emotional distress and improve quality of life. Specific aims: I plan to develop, refine, and test the feasibility and acceptability of a dyadic mind-body intervention for CA survivors with good neurologic recovery and their informal caregivers (“Recovering Together after Cardiac Arrest;” RT-CA). My aims are three-fold: 1) develop RT-CA through evidence-based frameworks (dyadic interdependence, response shift framework, family strength vulnerability model, resilience as a process) and evidence-based skills (from cognitive behavior therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness-based stress reduction), input from interviews with CA survivor-caregiver dyads (N=~12 dyads), and focus groups and interviews with CA medical stakeholders (N=16-24 stakeholders); 2) refine RT-CA through an open pilot (N=5 dyads) with exit interviews (for feedback) and pre-post assessments (for initial feasibility and acceptability); 3) test RT-CA for feasibility and acceptability (N=42 dyads) through a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) of RT-CA compared to a minimally enhanced usual control. Training: My research aims are supported by three training goals: 1) advanced qualitative methods for dyadic intervention development; 2) mixed methods for dyadic intervention refinement (integrating exit interview qualitative data with pre-post assessment quantitative data); 3) dyadic mind-body RCT methodology. My multi-disciplinary mentorship team is led by Dr. Ana-Maria Vranceanu, a clinical health psychologist and expert in developing and refining dyadic-mind body interventions, and Drs. Michael Donnino and Sarah Perman, emergency medicine physicians and experts in CA clinical trials and CA outcomes research respectively. My training goals are supported by 1) committed, multi-disciplinary mentors, 2) a rich institutional environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and 3) targeted coursework, health equity and diversity trainings, seminars and workshops, scientific meetings, and experiential learning. My proposal is in line with the NCCIH priority of “supporting impactful clinical trials of complementary and integrative health approaches.” Impact: I am a clinical psychology fellow committed to improving CA survivorship. This K23 is my first step towards becoming an independently funded investigator in improving CA and eventually critical care survivorship. This K23 will pave the way for future trials of RT-CA, including adaptations for culturally diverse dyads, survivors without informal caregivers, bereaved caregivers, and caregivers of comatose CA survivors. RT-CA has the potential to create a new standard of care for CA by providing mind-body skills and resources to cope with survivorship challenges."

Dementia is a major global health challenge that lacks effective treatment and early diagnosis tools. Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) comprises 70% of all dementia syndromes. The Lancet Commission recently urged a life-course
model of AD prevention, providing impetus for the development of scalable early biomarkers. Mitochondria play
a critical bioenergetic role in maintaining physiologic homeostasis, particularly for high energy demand organs,
like the brain. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number (mtDNA-CN), a quantitative indicator of mitochondrial
function, is strongly associated with AD in older adults. Growing evidence also implicates mtDNA mutation load,
or mtDNA heteroplasmy (mtDNA-Het), in AD. Despite the accumulating evidence for a key role of these blood
indicators in cognitive decline and AD in older adults, there is a paucity of research examining their relationships
in midlife, a critical time when preventive interventions may be most effective. Moreover, the relationships
between these mtDNA alterations and early emerging AD-related neurobiological substrates is unclear. While
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors have also been associated with mtDNA alterations, the temporal
associations are not fully discerned. Whether mtDNA alterations could mediate the well-known but less well
understood associations of heart and brain health is unknown. Our central hypothesis is that mtDNA alterations
are associated with cognitive decline and AD-related neurobiological substrates in midlife and mediate the
associations of early life CVD risk factors with midlife brain health. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage life-
long measures of CVD risk factors and two midlife measures of cognitive function in the full Bogalusa Heart
Study (BHS) cohort (N=1,298; 850 whites and 448 Blacks), along with AD-related neurobiological substrates
from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photon emission tomography (PET) scans available in a
large subsample at midlife (N=700). Within the BHS, we further propose measurement of mtDNA alterations at
two midlife time-points. Our well-powered validation effort will be conducted among diverse participants from the
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program (N=3,724) with existing data. These resources will allow us to
examine the prospective and temporal associations of mtDNA alterations with cognitive decline (Aim 1) and
neurobiological substrates in midlife (Aim 2); and assess prospective and temporal associations of early life
CVD risk factors with mtDNA and investigate mediating effects of mtDNA on associations of childhood CVD risk
factors with midlife brain health (Aim 3). Our work could have broad impacts on population-wide and targeted
efforts to curb dementia, informing drug development and risk stratification. The K99 training will allow me to
conduct the first study examining prospective associations of midlife mtDNA with cognitive decline. Mentored by
a team of experts in epidemiology, genomics, and neurobiological aging and led by my primary mentor Dr.
Kelly, this award will undoubtedly accelerate my career independence in multi-omics research of brain aging."

A healthy dentition with appropriately functioning teeth is essential for maintaining quality of life (QOL).
Disorders involving tooth eruption are prevalent, as high as 2–4% in permanent molars alone. Multiple molars
are involved in severe cases such as rare genetic conditions of primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE) or, more
commonly, bisphosphonate-induced arrest of tooth eruption in pediatric patients, which significantly
compromise the patients' ability to chew effectively. Because these molars do not response well to
conventional orthodontic approaches, innovative adjuvant therapies are needed to restore tooth eruption of
affected molars for better clinical outcomes. Tooth eruption is regulated by cells in the dental follicle (DF)
surrounding developing molars, which express parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and its cognate
PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R). Disruption of autocrine PTHrP-PTH1R signaling in PTHrP+ DF cells causes
failure of tooth eruption in murine molars that closely recapitulates the human PFE condition. Salt inducible
kinases (SIKs) are an essential downstream effector of PTH1R-cAMP/PKA signaling in bone, in which cAMP-
regulated PKA-dependent SIK inhibition is a key component of the anabolic actions of PTH. Small molecules
SIK inhibitors hold promise as a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance cAMP-induced signals in a receptor-
independent manner. In this proposal, we hypothesize that activation of the PTH1R signaling pathway by direct
SIK inhibition can restore defective tooth eruption of molars in mouse models of genetically and
pharmacologically induced tooth eruption disorders. In Aim 1, we will identify the roles of SIKs in PTHrP+ dental
follicle cells in tooth eruption. We hypothesize that SIKs regulate osteoblast cell fates of PTHrP+ DF cells and
tooth eruption. We will define the function of SIK2/SIK3 by conditionally deleting these genes in PTHrP+ DF
cells at the onset of tooth eruption. We will define short-term and long-term alterations in tooth eruption and
tooth root structures of mutant molars using histological and 3D microCT analyses. In Aim 2, we will determine
the effects of SIK inhibition in rescuing PFE in molars. We hypothesize that SIK inhibition rescues failure of
tooth eruption in molars genetically caused by PTH1R deficiency. We will determine the effects of SIK
inhibition in a mouse model of PFE, in which PTH1R is conditionally deleted in PTHrP+ DF cells at the onset of
tooth eruption. We will investigate whether PFE phenotypes can be rescued genetically by a concomitant loss
of SIK2/SIK3, and pharmacologically by SIK inhibitor YKL-05-099. In Aim 3, we will define PTHrP as a
bisphosphonate target and effects of SIK inhibitors in rescuing tooth eruption. We hypothesize that PTHrP-
PTH1R signaling is altered in PTHrP+ DF cells in response to zoledronic acid (ZOL), and ZOL-induced arrest of
tooth eruption in molars can be rescued by SIK inhibitors. We will treat ZOL-treated young mice with YKL-05-
099 to rescue tooth eruption. We will also define how ZOL inhibits PTHrP-PTH1R signaling activities, and
whether SIK inhibitors reverse ZOL-induced alternation of PTHrP signaling and aberrant PTHrP+ DF cell fates."
10733144,"Project 2 – Summary/Abstract
Seafood is a major dietary source of diverse chemical pollutants, especially for populations who rely on seafood
as their primary protein source. Despite industrial chemicals such as PBDE fire retardants, the insecticide DDT,
and PCB lubricants being banned in the U.S. for decades due to their harm to humans and the environment,
these legacy chemicals still pose health risks due to their persistence in the ocean environment. They all share
similar chemical features of polyhalogenation that account for their toxic properties that underlie a variety of
reproductive, teratogenic, neurological, cardiovascular, and immune disease outcomes. Polyhalogenation is also
a distinctive hallmark of natural chemicals common to marine life. Natural polybrominated compounds produced
by marine bacteria and algae, such as the ubiquitous hydroxylated and methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl
ethers (OH/MeO-BDEs), polybrominated pyrroles (PBPs), and recently discovered polybrominated bis-indole
toxins, have emerged as chemicals of human health concern. We and others have demonstrated that OH-BDEs
such as 6-OH-BDE-47 (thyroid hormone receptor) and PBPs such as tetrabromopyrrole (ryanodine receptor) are
developmental toxins and pose potential risks to humans. Many fundamental questions remain about the extent
of sources for these natural organohalogen molecules, how these chemicals enter and move through the marine
food web, whether changes in the climate will impact their production and accumulation, and in what situations
humans may be more impacted by natural organohalogens versus their anthropogenic counterparts. Recent
discoveries by the Moore and Allen laboratories have rigorously established the genetic and biochemical basis
for the microbial synthesis of natural OH/MeO-BDE, PBP, dioxins, and bromoindole molecules in diverse
lineages of marine and aquatic bacteria. However, the global distribution and ubiquity of these molecules in
marine biota is yet to be explained by the sources thus far discovered, suggesting additional biogenic sources
exist and are actively contributing to their accumulation in marine fauna. Moreover, even less is known about
marine microbial activities that promote organohalogen biotransformation leading to degradation, detoxification,
or, potentially, the enhanced toxicity and bioaccumulation potential of modified congeners. In this Project, new
genetic and biochemical evidence for the biosynthesis and biodegradation of natural and anthropogenic
organohalogens will be leveraged to establish the diverse marine microbial communities that interact with
common marine fish seafood species. An enhanced understanding of microbial processes that contribute to the
production and breakdown of these molecules is necessary to evaluate the ecological fate of biogenic and
anthropogenic toxicants as they relate to seafood safety. The Project 2 team will engage with other Center
investigators through the bidirectional sharing of environmental and fish samples (Project 1), the exchange of
synthetic and natural chemical standards for toxicology testing (Project 3), and the translation of this basic
research with key stakeholders and the public at-large (CEC)."
10864011,"Aphasia is an impairment that affects the production or comprehension of spoken, written, or gestured speech.
Effective prioritization and optimization of available treatment methods for people with aphasia (PWA)
requires an understanding of how the damaged system responds to different kinds of learning experiences, i.e.,
a theory of learning. This proposal continues development of a theory of learning for aphasia rehabilitation
based on retrieval practice (RP) principles, powerful learning principles derived from basic psychological
research. This renewal submission builds on the following findings concerning the treatment of the debilitating
and pervasive word retrieval deficit in aphasia: (a) retrieval practice-based naming treatment, in which the
PWA attempts to name an object followed by feedback, confers greater benefit to later naming of the same
items compared to errorless learning, in which the name is provided for the object and repeated by the PWA;
(b) correct retrievals during retrieval practice confer greater improvement compared to failed retrievals; (c)
greater spacing between an item’s trials confers greater improvement. Products of a basic phase of research,
these observations were derived from study designs involving the administration of a fixed number of trials per
item, regardless of the mastery achieved during training. This renewal submission takes important next steps
to broaden the clinical relevance of the RP theory by examining a retrieval practice-based naming treatment
termed criterion learning. In criterion learning, each item’s assigned criterion level dictates the number of
times that item is correctly retrieved before it is dropped from further training within a session. Criterion
learning optimally incorporates the most potent elements of the RP theory thus far—spaced retrieval practice
with emphasis on correct retrievals during training. By examining scheduling and dosing parameters, and
feasibility of at-home delivery, the present studies will provide critical observations for optimizing criterion
learning for treating word processing deficits in people with aphasia. Study 1 will identify the optimal
combination of criterion level and number of training sessions for efficiently attaining naming mastery of
functional, personally-relevant vocabulary for PWA with word retrieval deficit. Using a multiple-case, within-
participant, multiple baseline design, Study 2 will measure early efficacy and use of the optimal dosage-
schedule combination for mastery of functional vocabulary identified in Study 1. The two modules of treatment
in Study 2 will involve in-lab practice and unsupervised at-home practice. Brain imaging acquisition will
permit individual differences explorations in response to treatment. Study 3 will examine whether practicing
items in semantically related groups enhances naming treatment benefit in a multiple-session training regimen
using criterion learning. Study 4 will investigate whether naming treatment involving criterion learning
confers a benefit to word comprehension in PWA, and if it does so more robustly and durably than errorless
learning."
10891669,"Project Summary. Malaria puts at risk 50% of the world’s population and is responsible for nearly 600,000
yearly deaths, mostly in children under the age of five in Africa. While a large portfolio of anti-malarial agents
has been used to combat the disease, drug resistance has compromised the effectiveness of most clinically
approved drugs, and the recent identification of resistance alleles against the current front line artemisinin
combinations in Africa threatens current disease control programs. Thus, the identification of new drugs to
combat drug resistant malaria is essential to continued progress against the disease. Our group in
collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) validated dihydroorotate dehydrogenase as a clinically
valuable drug target for the treatment of malaria through studies on triazolopyrimidine DSM265, which
advanced to phase II clinical development before the project was stopped due to discovery of off-target toxicity
in preclinical species. In this current proposal we are working to identify new generation DHODH inhibitors by
focusing on a different chemical series from DSM265, thus not expected to share an overlapping toxicity profile.
Secondly, we plan structure-based approaches to identify inhibitors that will have reduced resistance risk
compared to DSM265, which selected for resistance in 2 patients treated in the Phase II study. In aim one we
plan to complete lead optimization of three related pyrazole-based DHODH inhibitor series, identified by
scaffold hop using computational approaches (in collaboration with Schrödinger) from a pyrrole series we
completed work on during the current fund period. Compounds from our pyrazole series have demonstrated
high potency (sub nanomolar to low micromolar), and a reduced propensity to select for resistant parasites in
vitro. We have a strong understanding of the SAR around these series, including the potency drivers, and the
metabolic hot spots, and we plan mix and match chemistry to identify compounds with improved metabolic
stability that will support human half-life (>100 h) and dosing targets (< 500 mg) set out by MMV. In aims 2
and 3 we use a combination of experimental and computational approaches (Schrödinger) to define the
enzyme:ligand kinetic and thermodynamic binding properties that are associated with reduced resistance risk,
as well as to correlate resistance risk to compound physical chemical properties. Computational models and
measured thermodynamic/kinetic parameters will inform design and synthesis of new compounds predicted to
have reduced resistance risk. The DHODH program is ideally suited to study the contribution of binding
energetics to resistance propensity, as we have a wealth of structural information over three different chemical
series with different physical chemical properties and alternative binding modes to the enzyme active site.
Successful completion of these aims will allow identification of the strongest DHODH candidate for further
clinical development, and it will provide key learnings on how to navigate resistance issues in target-based
drug discovery programs for proliferative diseases in general, increasing the impact of our studies."
10843184,"ABSTRACT / SUMMARY
 The goals of this research are to extend our discoveries of how blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD)
signals in white matter (WM), detected using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are related to neural
activity in gray matter (GM), and to implement new analyses that properly incorporate WM signals into models
of brain function derived from imaging data. For the past three decades, nearly all analyses of brain fMRI data
have ignored WM signals and usually have removed them as nuisance regressors. However, that view has
changed in light of more recent evidence that WM BOLD signals represent potentially important and heretofore
overlooked indicators of neural activity that are intimately related to how cortical regions communicate, and so
should be incorporated into complete assessments of functional connectivity. We have recently shown that
BOLD signals are robustly detectable in WM when appropriate analyses are used, that the hemodynamic
response function in WM is different from GM, and that WM tracts show reproducible patterns of apparent
connectivity which may be summarized in Functional Connectivity Matrices (FCMs), obtained by analyzing
resting state correlations between segmented WM and GM parcellations. Furthermore, distinct, reproducible
networks of WM emerge from data-driven analyses in similar manner to cortical circuits. In this proposal we aim
to develop new analyses and apply them to large numbers of publicly available data. We aim (1) to quantify the
functional relationships between WM fibers and GM circuits at a finer scale and in greater detail. We will extend
the concept of FCMs to three dimensions to derive those WM tracts that show synchronous time courses with
pairs of GM regions that themselves are identified from a matrix of GM-GM connectivity; (2) to use data-driven,
model-free independent component analyses to identify WM and GM functional networks and quantify the
correlations between them; and (3) to construct a suite of detailed and quantitative atlases characterizing
functional connectivity and network topology in WM, and establish their relationships with behavioral and
cognitive measures. Templates and digital atlases provide a way to spatially normalize data to common spaces,
and measure normal and abnormal variations quantitatively. Extending and applying the methodology from
structural and diffusion MRI fields to create atlases of WM functional data will enable reproducible quantification,
normalization, and interpretation of our results. Each analysis will also examine the influence of gender and age
on WM functional metrics.
Impact: BOLD signals in WM reflect neural activity that is related to cortical brain function, so analyses of the
functional engagement of WM are essential to properly model brain networks. This research would demonstrate
how WM and GM activities are related, and how to integrate them to obtain a more complete model of brain
organization. The results will lay a firm foundation for exploiting functional connectivity in white matter associated
with pathological or other changes across a spectrum of disorders and conditions."
10894762,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Light is an exceptional tool in disease treatment, offering precise controllability in treatment time and location.
Unlike UV light, longer visible and near infrared (IR) light is not toxic and reaches deeper tissues than UV for
clinical applications. However, chemical linkers that are cleavable by such biocompatible light are very scarce.
Long term goals are to develop chemical linkers that are cleaved by visible and near IR light for light-controlled
drug delivery, and to design and synthesize chemical conjugates that are used for pho-biomodulation. In the
previous project, a drug conjugate platform and photo-release strategy for site specific drug delivery were
established. Click and photo-unclick chemistry was demonstrated, where singlet oxygen (SO)-cleavable linker
is synthesized via amine-yne click reaction and cleaved by SO. The drug conjugates are composed of drug, SO-
cleavable linker, photosensitizer and cancer-targeting group. When illuminated with red light (690 nm), the
conjugates generate SO and release drug only in the illuminated region and treat the disease locally. In the next
5 years, a bolder photo-biomodulation strategy will be established using the light-responsive drug conjugate
platform. Overarching hypothesis is that local photo-biomodulation using visible and near IR light-responsive
conjugates can make systemic pharmacological effects via activation of immune system. Main goals in this
application are to design and prepare SO-cleavable conjugates of immunostimulant drugs and to prove that this
visible-light responsive conjugates can be used for generating systemic and tumor-specific anticancer effects.
The conjugates are activated by a focused local illumination, release drugs site-specifically, and stimulate
immune system to trigger systemic and tumor-specific immune responses. The systemic antitumor effect is
further enhanced by the combination with systemically administered drugs with non-overlapping mechanisms
with the local photo-biomodulation. The goals are realized with 3 specific aims: (1) Design and prepare SO-
activatable conjugates of immune-stimulating drugs and determine systemic antitumor effects, (2) Determine the
mechanisms of systemic effects of the photo-biomodulation and establish the immuno-pharmacodynamics, (3)
Determine the enhanced systemic antitumor effect of the local photo-biomodulation by adding clinically available
checkpoint inhibitors. Pharmacokinetic and immune-pharmacodynamic modeling is used for analyzing and
simulating dynamic changes of conjugates, released drugs, and immune cells in various tissues to gain
mechanistic insight at the systemic level. Major deliverables are (i) red-light responsive conjugates of
immunostimulant drugs, (ii) immune-pharmacodynamic models following photo-biomodulation, and (iii) validation
of our local photo-biomodulation for systemic effects. The strategy is tested using breast and colon cancer animal
models but it could be applicable for a wide range of tumors using interstitial or external illumination."
10861035,"The goal of this research project is to further the development of a pan-Pneumovirus vaccine and to test our
hypothesis that a chimeric Pneumovirus fusion (F) protein vaccine displaying immunodominant epitopes of
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) will induce broad protection against both
viruses. RSV and hMPV are widely prevalent agents of childhood viral respiratory infection, causing thousands
of deaths and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations each year. There are currently no approved vaccines
to elicit protective antibodies against either virus, and no specific treatment options are available. The F
glycoproteins of RSV and hMPV have been well-studied as targets of neutralizing antibodies, and several
vaccine candidates for RSV are in clinical trials. We have developed a novel vaccine candidate (RHMS-1)
encompassing immunodominant epitopes of both RSV and hMPV F proteins and verified its protective
efficacy in mouse and cotton rat models. The rationale for pursuing a chimeric vaccine candidate is based
on several factors, including focusing the immune response to only those epitopes that elicit potent neutralizing
antibodies rather than less potent or non-neutralizing epitopes to improve protection, reducing vaccine escape
compared to previous chimeric vaccines incorporating a single epitope, and the assessment of the first chimeric
vaccine candidate beyond the mouse model. Additionally, we will determine immune correlates of protection for
hMPV infection in a nonhuman primate model. These critical studies will provide a wealth of immunologic
information in highly relevant, pre-clinical models that will guide an evidence-based path toward the optimization
of a safe and effective pan-Pneumovirus vaccine. Our research will substantially advance the field by
developing a vaccine for protection against the two leading causes of acute lower respiratory tract infection in
children. As the pre-fusion RSV F protein has already demonstrated safety and the ability to elicit an effective
immune response, we will build upon this success to extend this vaccine for protection against hMPV. In Aim 1,
we will computationally stabilize and redesign our vaccine candidate, RHMS-1, using Rosetta to enhance protein
stability and immunogenicity, and the best candidates will be rapidly screened in mice as both protein subunit
and mRNA-lipid nanoparticle vaccines. In Aim 2, we will conduct structural and epitope analysis of our top
vaccine candidate to verify the epitopes on RHMS are similar to RSV F and hMPV F proteins. In Aim 3, we will
determine the protective efficacy of the top candidate RHMS vaccine in cotton rat and African Green Monkey
models of RSV and hMPV infection. Our proposal is both conceptually and practically innovative as we are
designing and testing novel vaccine candidates for protection against two important respiratory pathogens, and
we are challenging current paradigms in the field by providing a single antigen for dual-virus protection.
Furthermore, the innovation of the team is very high, as this proposal brings together diverse investigators and
several state of the art technologies."
10732523,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core of the Great Lakes Center for Fresh Waters and Human Health (the Center) at the
University of Michigan (UM) will manage fundamental research and community-based projects ultimately
focused on understanding and mitigating toxic cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (cHAB) risks in the Great
Lakes, especially in Lake Erie. Western Lake Erie has been plagued by cHAB blooms for the last decade, and
recent bloom events have resulted in exposure risks that led to the complete shutdown of the Toledo (OH)
water supply in 2014. The Center’s Administrative Core is focused on supporting and coordinating four
integrated research projects, a Community Engagement Core and a Facility Core to ensure progress toward
our stated goals of understanding and translating climate change effects on cHAB events and their impact on
human health in the lower Great Lakes. A Director, Director Emeritus, and Co-Director will lead the
Administrative Core; they will be responsible for reporting progress and outcomes of Center activities. They will
meet monthly with the Internal Steering Committee, which will oversee coordination of research and of
community outreach and public policy, data management and budget management. Relevant research results
and potential policy outcomes will be communicated to state agencies and NGOs as they emerge. The
Administrative Core will be assessed by an External Advisory Committee (EAC), staffed by scientists outside of
the participating institutions, as well as representatives from state agencies and NGOs. The Center for
Educational Design, Evaluation and Research (CEDER) at UM will work with the EAC to conduct the
assessment with a utilization-focused evaluation and including formative and summative process and
outcomes evaluation components. Communication from the Center with other OHH Centers will promote
collaboration and data sharing where appropriate."
10732524,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMMUNITY ENAGEMENT CORE
The Center’s Community Engagement Core (CEC) effort will use a multifaceted approach to engage a diverse
audience of stakeholders to change behavior, inform management decisions, and identify policies that could be
proposed to address the effects of climate change on cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (cHABs) and
human health in the Great Lakes region. The CEC will (1) strengthen environmental literacy, (2) disseminate
and implement scientific research findings, and (3) both identify and address research gaps by engaging with
key and diverse stakeholders (e.g., decision makers, agency staff, students, local business, media personnel,
diverse and underrepresented watershed residents). The Center’s goal is not only to understand cHABs risk
more thoroughly, but via the CEC to (1) prevent future issues by informing management and policy levers and
(2) reducing or eliminating harm by engaging with individuals that have increased risk of exposure to cHABs.
This engagement approach will be guided by Sea Grant leaders from Michigan and Ohio (Drs. Triezenberg
and Winslow; Associate Director and Director, respectively) and a dedicated cHAB Extension Educator. Drs.
Triezenberg and Winslow, and their teams, have years of experience designing and deploying informal
outreach and formal education programming that help resource managers (1) use ecosystem-based
approaches to manage land, water and living resources in coastal areas; (2) implement sustainable economic
and environmental development practices and policies; (3) implement hazard resiliency practices to prepare
for, respond to, or minimize coastal hazardous events; and (4) develop outreach products and tools that
advance environmental literacy and workforce development. The CEC will leverage the Center’s research
enterprise to recruit and train a diverse next-generation of OHH scientists via the numerous NSF programs,
fellowship programs, and hands-on “camp” experiences for high school students supported at members’
respective institutions. The CEC will promote the dissemination of cHAB research to the general public and
enhance scientific writing by engaging with media partners and journalism departments at select member
institutions. CEC, working with the University of Toledo’s Environmental, Occupational, and Community
Medicine Program, will (1) facilitate community and stakeholder involvement in clinical and translational
research and (2) address disparities toward health equity by identifying the environmental, structural, and
sociocultural factors that contribute to poor health outcomes for high-risk groups. Finally, the CEC will use
existing community science outreach relationships with the Lake Erie Charter Captains Association and the
U.S. Coast Guard to expose an impactful audience of the lessons learned and research gaps identified by the
Center in the cHABs space. Ultimately, the CEC will be a conduit to convey Center research findings to inform
behavior change and inform management and policy decisions."
10732526,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and these events quickly
alter lakes' chemical (increase nutrients) and physical (temperature, light penetration) characteristics, which
can promote cyanobacterial bloom development. Collectively, we term these extreme weather events and their
effects ""episodic events."" Our proposal aims to resolve how climate change-intensified episodic events affect
bloom growth/maintenance, production of cyanotoxins and taste and odor (T&O) compounds, and
phycosphere processes. Our study will include both planktonic and benthic blooms, as it is recognized that
benthic cyanobacterial blooms pose human health and welfare concerns due to cyanotoxin production and
their high biomasses. Additionally, we will investigate how production of several classes of cyanotoxins is
altered by episodic events. This is made possible by expanding the Center's Facility Core, which now can
measure many congeners of microcystins, saxitoxins, anatoxins, and anabaenopeptins. We also will analyze
T&O compounds since these compounds, while not toxic, negatively affect the perception of drinking water.
Moreover, because pathogenic bacteria (Klebsiella and Aeromonas) have been found in Lake Erie blooms, we
will address the questions of what relationships exist between cyanobacteria and associated pathogens,
whether blooms serve as reservoirs for pathogens, and if episodic events favor them. We will accomplish our
objectives using an experimental approach and lake surveys. We will focus on planktonic blooms in Years 1
and 2, and the benthos in Years 3 and 4. In all years, we will conduct factorial experiments in Stone Lab's new
state-of-the-art mesocosm facility to tease apart temperature, light, and nutrients synergistic interactions. The
planktonic or benthic algae in the experiments will be held in the mesocosms at ambient conditions to
accumulate before introducing the variables of episodic events. We will collect samples for algal biomass,
cyanotoxins, T&O, and phycosphere processes before and after the episodic events. Also, we will conduct
experiments to determine how container size affects phytoplankton's response to changing environmental
conditions. Results from the experiments can be interpreted through the lens of field samples taken from
routine monitoring programs and additional sample collection following episodic events. In Years 1 and 2, we
will coordinate with Project 2 and leverage other funding to collect weekly samples from 22 sites in Lake Erie.
In Years 3 and 4, we will collect weekly Microseira wollei samples for cyanotoxins, phycosphere processes,
and ambient water quality data. Models from the cellular to the lake ecosystem level will be informed by
experimental data measuring plankton dynamics in various abiotic conditions; their predictions will be tested
against field observations. By connecting knowledge gained by our project and Project 3, predictions will be
made and tested for of cyanotoxin exposure via inhalation to lakeshore communities (Project 4)."
10733090,"ABSTRACT – OVERALL
The North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae, People, and Environment (NC C-CAPE) will combine
multidisciplinary expertise in ocean and climate science, toxicology, epidemiology, modeling, and community
engagement to understand, predict, and reduce risks to human health from cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms
(HABs) in coastal waters. Growing threats to ecosystem and human health are expected with the increasing
frequency, intensity, and range of cyanobacterial blooms, attributable to eutrophication and climate change. For
NC's coastal waters, including US' largest lagoonal estuary, the Pamlico-Albemarle Sound System, concerns
about emergent HABs have surged and coincide with reports on cyanobacterial toxin presence, mainly
microcystins (MCs), in water and seafood. The transport of toxic algae and MCs along the freshwater-to-marine
continuum further increases the potential to spread MC risks across coastal environments. Epidemiological
studies measuring the association of MC exposure and liver toxicity, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), in rodent models are necessary to determine whether chronic MC exposure is associated with liver
toxicity, NAFLD and liver cancer in humans. Most research and environmental testing have focused on a single
MC congener but since blooms are associated with mixtures of congeners that vary in toxicity, further data is
needed to understand risks that emerge from MC mixtures and inform human health guidelines. NC C-CAPE
will investigate the health effects of various MC mixtures, and elucidate links among environmental drivers and
HAB dynamics, MC congener composition, and toxin contamination in oysters and blue crabs. Project 1 will
advance our understanding of HAB dynamics and MC contamination in seafood, combining state-of-the-art in
situ observing technologies and targeted field surveys. In addition, experimental work will elucidate trophic
transfer of toxins in oysters and blue crabs. Project 2 will define how MC mixtures influence mechanisms of liver
toxicity and resulting risk of adverse health outcomes in regulatory-relevant mammalian models as well as at-
risk human populations. Project 3 will integrate highly diverse data sets and coastal circulation modeling within
a probabilistic modeling framework to elucidate environmental controls on MC distribution in water and seafood
and assess MC exposure risk in a changing climate. The Center's Community Engagement Core will use the
principles of data justice, where community members are experts with the capacity to conduct critical and
systemic inquiry into their own lived experiences, to address HAB exposure and prevention. The Administrative
Core will provide effective fiscal and scientific leadership to promote collaborations across all Center components
and beyond. As an integrated whole, NC C-CAPE will provide significant insight to guide efforts to implement
effective monitoring approaches, inform guideline values for safe consumption of water and seafood, deliver
predictive tools to assess emergent and future toxin exposure risk, and leverage community engagement
initiatives to fill data gaps and improve oceans and human health."
10918229,"Project Summary/Abstract
Organ transplantation is the best therapeutic option to improve quality of life and mortality for many patients
suffering from organ failure. Unfortunately, over 10,000 die or become too sick each year while on the waitlist
due to an extreme organ shortage. Native Americans (NA) and other minorities are less likely to receive an
organ transplant and are also less likely to become an organ donor. Increasing organ donation is a critical
strategy to reduce disparities in access to transplant. Despite numerous research interventions to increase
organ donation, rates of waitlisting and transplant have not increased in the United States in the past two
decades. Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) are a primary driver of the deceased donation process
and provide local service areas with education and family support. OPOs are a critical resource to disseminate
interventions across the US through local community relationships. The TalkDonation campaign to increase
NA organ donation was developed and piloted in urban Minneapolis by LifeSource, an OPO serving Minnesota
and surrounding states. However, OPOs face a barrier to continuously improve and scale interventions
because the national transplant system does not provide a feedback loop to identify what interventions are
effective in individual communities. A Learning Health System (LHS) model with a focus on embedded
research, systems thinking, and integration of outcomes data into practice can provide a sustainable national
system for monitoring organ donation outcomes using publicly available data. The LHS for organ donation will
use the TalkDonation program to develop and evaluate organ donation equity-focused data tools that are
adaptable across geographies and interventions to monitor and guide community-level interventions across the
US. The proposed organ donation data tools will describe organ donation at county, race, and ethnicity levels
to monitor disparities in organ donation (Aim 1). We will expand TalkDonation implementation through multi-
phased engagement with Tribal Communities in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota to increase
support for organ donation. We will conduct participatory workshops to understand community perspectives
and tailor materials for unique needs in Northern Great Plains Native American communities. (Aim 2). We will
use surveys and in-depth interviews to assess the use of a Learning Health System model following the
implementation of the TalkDonation campaign and monitoring with the equity data tools. We will use the RE-
AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) implementation framework and
identify implementation outcomes to facilitate scaling and sustainability (Aim 3). This research will allow us to
develop a systematic outcomes feedback loop to inform interventions across other populations experiencing
health disparities and other solid organ transplant fields as well as tissue donation. In addition, the proposed
research will increase awareness and transparency of the organ donation system, potentially improving
community trust in the transplant system and reducing persistent disparities."
10883716,"Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the USA and globally due to myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Despite
statin treatment to reduce LDL cholesterol, its incidence is on the rise due to the global epidemic of obesity, metabolic
syndrome (MetS), and early onset type-2 diabetes (T2D). Indeed, more than half of the mortality in T2D is caused by
cardiovascular complications. Human histopathological studies have shown that lesions prone to plaque rupture, with
catastrophic thromboembolic events like MI or stroke, have a thin fibrous cap and a high CD68+/ACTA2+ [presumed
MФ/smooth muscle cell (SMC)] cell ratio. These characteristics occur at a higher prevalence in atherosclerotic
lesions of diabetics and in women versus men. However, we have a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which
insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and other metabolic abnormalities in T2D-MetS exacerbate atherosclerotic
disease. We recently demonstrated that although multiple cell types contribute to formation of the ACTA2+ fibrous
cap, long-term plaque stability is dependent on SMC. Moreover, we showed that aerobic glycolysis, a pathway
dysregulated in T2D is required for transition of SMC to a beneficial myofibroblast (MF)-like state critical for formation
and maintenance of a stable fibrous cap. Results are of major interest given studies of Clemmons and co-workers
showing that SMC-selective knockout of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), a protein required for insulin and insulin-
like growth factor-1 (IGF1) signaling, resulted in de-differentiation of SMC, hyper-proliferation, and increased
neointimal formation following femoral artery injury. However, they did no atherosclerosis studies and did not consider
that de-differentiated SMC could have beneficial or detrimental effects on lesion pathogenesis depending on the
nature of their phenotypic transitions. Studies in this proposal will test the hypothesis that insulin-IGF1 resistance
in SMC combined with metabolic abnormalities including the profound hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia
associated with T2D-MetD results in detrimental (plaque de-stabilizing) changes in SMC phenotype. Aim 1 will
determine if insulin-IGF1 signaling in SMC is required for their investment into the fibrous cap and transition to a
plaque stabilizing MF phenotype. Aim 2 will determine if global insulin resistance and the associated metabolic
changes, including hyperglycemia, promote atherosclerosis development and late-stage lesion pathogenesis by
inducing detrimental changes in SMC phenotype. Aim 3 will determine potential mechanisms by which impaired
insulin-IGF1 signaling in SMC contributes to late-stage lesion pathogenesis in humans with T2D/MetS. Studies
include: 1) use of our novel SMC lineage tracing atherosclerotic mice with global or SMC-specific insulin
resistance with or without systemic metabolic dysfunction including hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia; 2)
rigorous analysis of indices of plaque stability and phenotypic transitions of SMC and other lesion cells; 3)
genomic studies to identify genes and pathways whereby T2D-MetS promote plaque-destabilizing changes in
SMC phenotype; and 4) human validation studies. Our ultimate goal is to identify novel therapeutic interventions
for promoting increased plaque stability in patients with T2D-MetS."

The intestinal lumen contains a plethora of proteins from the diet and microbiota that require tolerogenic
responses. If tolerance is not properly mounted against these innocuous proteins the mucosal immune system
constantly encounters, individuals become progressively at-risk for inflammatory disorders including food
allergies or inflammatory bowel diseases. As these disorders increase in incidence, particularly within the
pediatric population, understanding how the immune system encounters luminal antigens during early life must
be thoroughly explored for the prevention and treatment of these disorders. Currently, exclusive breastfeeding
is the recommended dietary practice for infants through the first three months, followed by complementary
breastfeeding with introduction of solid foods. Yet the world health organization estimates only 30% of infants
globally are exclusively breastfed in the first three months, and alternative diets ranging from infant formula to
goat’s milk are used for a variety of reasons. Breastfeeding is significantly associated with decreased risk of food
allergy and IBD, and a number of beneficial components of breast milk have been identified. We have previously
shown epidermal growth factor (EGF) is highly concentrated in breastmilk, particularly early in lactation.
Immediately following delivery, EGF inhibits antigen delivery within the neonates intestine, and a lack of dietary
EGF is associated with increased intestinal permeability. As the infant ages, EGF in breastmilk decreases
allowing antigen delivery to occur and FoxP3+ regulatory T cells develop in response to orally derived antigens
during this time. Thus, maternal EGF regulates antigen delivery until a time when the infant is prepared to
develop tolerogenic responses to encountered antigen. Our preliminary data shows decreased dietary EGF or
disrupting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor within intestinal cells of the neonate resulted in early antigen
delivery, decreased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells at the time of weaning, and an increased predisposition to
intestinal inflammation in a model of colitis. Interestingly, while FoxP3+ regulatory T cell differentiation was
initiated in response to early antigen delivery, these cells eventually lost FoxP3 expression but remained in the
intestine, becoming effector cells. Antigen delivery was also associated with an increase in CX3CR1+ F4/80+
antigen presenting cells, however the role neonatal antigen presenting cells downstream of antigen delivery
remains unknown. These data suggest early antigen delivery in the absence of maternal EGF regulation disrupts
oral tolerance during early life. Here we will 1) determine the effect of neonatal antigen delivery on antigen
presenting cells in the colon and 2) determine the mechanism through which neonatal antigen delivery abrogates
regulatory T cells. This work has important implication in why antigen delivery during early life is regulated by
breast milk, and the consequences of early antigen delivery in the absence of maternal regulation."

The primary goal of the Bioinformatics Core of VCU’s U4HELPP is to provide data management, quality control,
reproducible analyses, data storage, and data sharing with the PDXNet network for all information generated by
our project. In addition, it will provide centralized bioinformatics, statistical and methodological support for the
two research projects, Pilot Project, and future projects that will build upon them. The Core will serve as the focal
point governing the experimental design, data management, and statistical analyses for the two research
projects. We will reach these goals through three aims. The first aim establishes the protocol to develop and
maintain a central data, resource, and sample management system that enables an interface between multiple
disciplines including genomics, basic science, and clinical medicine. This aim will ensure that all data and
analyses are of high quality, conform to good laboratory practices specifications, and are disseminated to all
PDXNet members in a timely fashion. The second aim will be to provide bioinformatics, statistics, and
methodological support from project initiation through completion and beyond. The third aim will improve quality
of analysis of sequencing data from minorities by constructing and applying the ancestry appropriate reference
genome. The Core includes members from the Department of Biostatistics at VCU, the Bioinformatics Shared
Resource and Cancer Informatics Shared Resource at Massey Cancer Center (MCC)."

The fundamental objective of this proposal is to fractionate human defensive circuits and behaviors. Our approach
addresses three key issues. These include the knowledge that: (i) experimental paradigms have failed to fractionate the
diverse subjective emotions and neural representations across different levels of threat imminence; (ii) a failure to create richer
behavioral assays in humans to address the growing measurement gap between rodent and human studies of emotion; and (iii) a
lack of focus on how these neural representations and behaviors diverge as a function of sex, therefore providing little or no
insight in the sex disparity in anxiety disorders. To answer these questions, a critical first step is to understand how the
human brain responds to different levels of threat imminence. In this proposal, we will create a new set of paradigms that
provide a comprehensive fractionation of the human defensive system that include the emotions of fear and anxiety, and
link them to a rich set of covert behavioral assays and overt decisions that vary along changing modes of threat
imminence.
We address these challenges via four specific aims:
Aim 1. Provide a comprehensive fractionation of human defensive circuits, bodily emotions, and behaviors. Aim 1 has
three key goals. This includes fractionating the defensive circuits involved in pre- and post-encounter (potential threat)
and circa-strike (acute threat) modes of threat using a single task. We will identify novel behavioral measures for each
mode of threat. Finally, we will measure subjective bodily emotional states for each level of threat imminence and
correlate with Expts. 1-3.
Aim 2. What brain regions direct the switching between offensive and defensive states? Here we aim to validate Aim 1 by
examining the defensive behaviors and neural basis of post-encounter and circa-strike threat. Further, we extend on Aim 1
by investigating the role of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and vmPFC during switching between offensive and defensive
survival states.
Aim 3. What parts of the defensive circuit coordinate avoidance decisions? Extends on Aims 1 and 2 by assessing which
parts of the defensive circuitry are involved in explicit, pre-emptive avoidance decisions. Further, we will examine the
effects of attack predictability on risky or safe decisions and learning, thereby extending on the more implicit behaviors
measured in Aims 1-2.
Aim 4. Investigate how different parts of the defensive circuits differ in response to threats in males and females. Given
that females demonstrate higher rates of anxiety disorders, we will investigate how sex is associated with brain activity,
subjective emotions, defense behaviors, and decisions measured in Aims 1-3. We will cross-validate the sex difference
findings across Aims 1-3 by comparing overlapping circuits and behaviors.
At conclusion, this work will provide fundamental insights into how different parts of the human defensive systems
operate under well-defined modes of threat imminence. The close links between our aims also provides several
advantages, including a cross-validation of our results, the ability to examine how behaviors and brain systems diverge
across the sexes, provide closer links with contemporary animal models."

Conventional prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men.
Patients with organ-confined disease are candidates for potentially curative treatment by either radical
prostatectomy or radiation therapy. However, 20-40% of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and 30-50%
of patients undergoing radiation therapy can experience biochemical recurrence within 10 years. These findings
indicate that there is suboptimal identification of lethal PCa at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, identification of
aggressive disease at the time of diagnosis could stratify patients, develop more effective therapy options, and
extend survival. In the clinical setting, noninvasive imaging biomarkers are routinely measured with
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). However, mpMRI has multiple limitations that result in
reduced sensitivity and specificity for PCa, in part from obscuration from inflammatory or stromal cells in the
prostate. This proposal advances the use of a clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, diffusion
basis spectral imaging (DBSI), that has the ability to detect structural and cellular changes in the PCa
microenvironment (e.g., stroma, inflammation, tumor), that cannot otherwise be determined with conventional
mpMRI, a significant advancement. In parallel, our team has discovered a panel of extracellular proteoglycomic
biomarkers in lethal forms of PCa (i.e., fucosylated glycans and modified collagens—“FuCol” biomarkers) with
Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging of histologic specimens. These
molecular markers provide insight into the structural derangements of lethal PCa and because structural changes
affect water diffusion, it suggests that these structural changes may actually be detectable with DBSI. We
hypothesize that MALDI-detected proteoglycomic markers, expressed as the FuCol score, are associated with
structural and metabolic changes in lethal PCa that can be visualized with DBSI to better identify aggressive,
potentially lethal PCa at the time of diagnosis. In the first Aim, we will continue to validate our FuCol score as a
predictor of disease recurrence and metastasis in a large institutional biorepository. In this Aim, we will
investigate the effects of race and diet on the FuCol score and its ability to predict poor outcomes. We will also
establish the ability to measure a FuCol score as part of a “noninvasive liquid biopsy” to predict outcomes. In
Aim 2, we will enroll a prospective cohort of prostatectomy patients to develop “Diffusion Molecular Imaging
(DMI)”; an AI-driven tool that generates in vivo FuCol scores using in vivo DBSI as its input prior to prostatectomy,
hence a non-invasive imaging readout of lethal disease. In Aim 3, we will develop an augmented risk prediction
model that incorporates novel DBSI imaging, the clinical Decipher genomics platform, and conventional clinical
metrics (grade, stage, PSA) to better predict lethal disease at prostatectomy. In summary, these experiments
will result in rapid acceleration of a clinically-ready workflow to detect molecular biomarkers associated with poor
outcomes. This will dovetail with parallel strategies that our group is developing to treat these cohorts of patients
with lethal prostate cancer variants."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). The
treatment of these diseases remains challenging, with many patients ultimately dying. Despite the clinical
success of recent advanced immunotherapies against different tumor types, DLBCLs are largely refractory to
these new therapies. The immune resistance mechanisms of these diseases are unclear. The heterogeneity
of DLBCLs suggests that their treatment can benefit from precision-medicine approaches. Mutations in the
TLR mediator MYD88 and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling molecules, including CD79B, define the MCD-
DLBCL subtype, which displays the greatest aggressiveness and refractoriness to therapies. MYD88 and
BCR pro-lymphoma signals are integrated by a downstream molecular complex, whose major functional
subunit is MALT1. Targeting MALT1 thus represents an attractive option to specifically interrupt the driver
pro-lymphoma signals of these aggressive diseases and block their growth. Our collaborators developed the
first selective MALT1 inhibitor (MALT1i) and contributed to the generation of the first MALT1i ever tested in
patients (NCT03900598; NCT04876092; NCT04657224). Notably, MALT1 is also active in cells that dampen
anti-tumor immunity, specifically immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) and exhausted T cells (Tex),
which are incapable to react and kill tumor cells. Thanks to our unique access to newly developed MCD-
DLBCL mouse models, which harbor an intact immune system, we can now for the first time reliably examine
the direct anti-tumor and immune-mediated effects of MALT1is, and their potential for combination with
immunotherapy. Our preliminary studies in these models show that MALT1is decrease MCD-DLBCL cells as
well as lymphoma-infiltrating Tregs and Tex. Moreover, we find that MALT1is increase MCD-DLBCL antigen
presentation and co-stimulatory potential as well as T-cell activation and tumoricidal function, which may
overall promote anti-lymphoma T-cell responses. Thus, we hypothesize that pharmacologic MALT1 inhibition
in the setting of MCD-DLBCLs will have dual positive anti-tumor effects: (1) limiting tumor proliferation, by
interrupting the MYD88 and BCR pro-lymphoma signals and (2) potentiating anti-lymphoma immunity, by
counteracting immunosuppressive and dysfunctional T cells and increasing lymphoma cell immunogenicity.
Based on this hypothesis, our objective is to establish optimal combinations of MALT1is with immunotherapy
able to eradicate otherwise immune evasive aggressive lymphomas. Toward this goal, we will test clinically
relevant MALT1is alone and in combination with immunotherapy against MCD-DLBCLs in syngeneic mouse
models with normal vs. defective immune system (i.e. lacking specific T-cell subsets/function) to discover the
mechanisms by which MALT1 inhibition promotes anti-lymphoma immunity. Moreover, we will perform the
first validation that MALT1is can activate T-cell responses in patients enrolled in NCT03900598."

Abstract
This project will develop and optimize oxygen-enhanced (OE) imaging of dynamic ventilation of the lungs
simultaneously with high resolution acquisition of lung parenchymal anatomy in a single, free-breathing 7-minute
acquisition using 3D ultra-short time to echo (UTE) MRI. Advances in 3D UTE MRI now support regional imaging
of lung anatomy with CT-like contrast, full chest coverage, and isotropic 1 mm spatial resolution. We will employ
advanced motion compensation reconstruction with manifold-based deep learning and UTE center-out k-space
trajectories to isolate respiratory motion from T1 changes due to oxygen wash-in and wash-out during free-
breathing. The resulting motion compensated reconstruction provides both quantitative ventilation and high-
resolution structure in a single 7-minute series. Multiple chronic lung diseases will be studied with this approach
to establish utility and repeatability of the method in comparison to quantitative chest CT and hyperpolarized
129Xe MRI. Our preliminary data demonstrates the utility of MRI-only exam of lung structure and ventilation in a
manner similar to that provided by nuclear SPECT with technegas and X-ray CT but without ionizing radiation.
We hypothesize that 3D UTE MR imaging of ventilation dynamics will capture co-localized structure-function for
monitoring ventilation heterogeneity relative to structural features of lung disease, including fibrosis, granulomas,
mucus plugging, bronchiectasis, ground glass, and fibrosis. Radiology expert reader studies will be performed
with direct comparison of UTE MRI with quantitative chest CT for depiction of structural and functional (derived
from static multi-volumetric images) abnormalities, and OE MRI regional patterns of ventilation to hyperpolarized
129Xe MRI. We seek to create an MRI method and protocol for structure-function assessment of chronic lung
disease with broad access, no exposure to ionizing radiation (allowing for longitudinal assessment at increased
granularity), and using a safe, inexpensive and widely available paramagnetic gas. The specific aims of the
project are to: 1) Improve data acquisition efficiency for 3D UTE MRI at clinical field strengths; 2) Develop
dynamic OE MRI of oxygen ventilation wash-in and wash-out during free breathing, and 3) Develop OE
MRI visualization and analysis tools for regional structure-function associations. The 3D OE MRI
approach is inexpensive, uses proton-based contrast and can characterize both structural and functional aspects
of chronic lung disease in a manner similar to SPECT/CT without concern for ionizing radiation exposure."

Immunoregulatory cytokines engage transmembrane signaling receptors in order to mediate a wide range of
functions including leukocyte proliferation, differentiation, and expansion through JAK/STAT activation. Most
immunoregulatory cytokines possess both redundant and distinct activities that are critical to normal immune
homeostasis, but this functional pleiotropy presents a major problem for the effective use of these cytokines as
immunotherapeutic cancer drugs. Cytokine pleiotropy is a consequence of different cytokine receptors being
expressed on multiple different counterbalancing cell types that serves to neutralize anti-tumor actions and lead
to systemic toxicity. During the prior term of this award, we gained an appreciation for the extracellular
structural architectures of a spectrum of different immune cytokine complexes, including those of IL-2, IL-10,
IL-12, IL-21, IL-22, IL-23, IL-27, IFN, and IFN. In this renewal application, with these structural templates in
hand, in Aim 1 we focus our studies on the cytokines IL-2, IFN, and IL-12. These immune master regulators
engage different but overlapping branches of the immune system, and share the issues of pleiotropy and toxicity
that, if uncoupled, could lead to powerful cancer immunotherapeutic agents. We propose to “tune” signaling
through structure-based cytokine engineering to attempt to create variants with decoupled pleiotropy, cell subset
preferences, enhanced anti-tumor efficacies, and reduced toxicity – both alone and in combination. In Aim 2, we
wish to understand the mechanistic basis for how tuned cytokines can differentially activate signaling inside the
cells. Based on a recent breakthrough in our 20-year quest to solve the full-length JAK structure, we continue to
pursue structural information on how cytokine binding to their receptors activates Janus Kinase (JAK)
molecules, by reconstituting and imaging activated JAK homo- and heterodimers bound to both cytokine and
intracellular JAKs and STATs. In this fashion, by combining structural biology, protein engineering, cell
signaling, and in vivo tumor studies, we propose to obtain a complete molecular snapshot of cytokine receptor
signaling from the initial engagement of ligand through the activation of intracellular signaling cascades and
leverage this information for the engineering of cancer immunotherapeutics."

 2 The prevalence of child obesity in the U.S. has tripled since the 1970s and excess weight gain – even in young
 3 children – is a precursor to adult obesity and associated co-morbidities. In the U.S. it is recommended that
 4 children consume whole cow’s milk (3.5% fat) from ages 1 to 2 years to support rapid early growth and brain
 5 development, and then at age 2 years transition to low-fat (1%) or non-fat milk to reduce saturated fat and
 6 calorie intake. Surprisingly few rigorous trials support recommendations regarding the optimal amount of fat in
 7 milk. Paradoxically, existing observational studies suggest that lower fat milk consumption is associated with
 8 increased adiposity in children. The effects of the types of fat found in milk on cardiometabolic disease risk
 9 have also been questioned. We propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of consumption of
10 whole versus 1% milk on child adiposity and other health and developmental outcomes beginning after
11 toddlers have successfully transitioned from breastmilk and/or formula to cow’s milk at 2 years of age. For the
12 proposed trial, Milk Type in Toddlers (Milk-TOT) Study, we will recruit 625 parents of toddlers and randomly
13 assign them to either whole or 1% milk groups for 1 year. Our primary aim is to determine how milk fat type
14 (whole versus 1%) consumed from age 2 to 3 years affects change in adiposity as measured by waist-to-height
15 ratio (primary outcome), and body mass index z-score, tri-ponderal mass index, and waist circumference z-
16 score (secondary outcomes). Secondary aims are to evaluate how milk type consumed from age 2 to 3 years
17 affects changes in milk, total and saturated fat, added sugars, total energy intake and overall diet quality, as
18 well as blood lipids, glucoregulatory indices, vitamin D status, and neurocognitive development. An exploratory
19 aim will assess changes in gut microbiota. Results from the Milk-TOT Study will inform evidence-based
20 recommendations about the optimal milk fat that children need to optimize their growth, development, and
21 health. Such recommendations will influence healthcare provider advice about the type of milk that children
22 consume as well as inform federal nutrition programs that collectively provide milk to half of young children in
23 the U.S."

Rates of cirrhosis from nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are rapidly rising in young adults, and given limited
therapies and the heterogeneity of affected individuals, there is an urgent and unmet need to identify tailored
therapeutic targets for at-risk young populations. Androgens may reflect such target for the 10-15%, or nearly
10 million reproductive-aged women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is typically marked by
elevated androgens, and over 50% of these women have NAFLD. We have shown PCOS to increase the risk
of prevalent NASH and advanced NASH fibrosis, which occurs at a younger age than in non-PCOS controls.
High androgens may explain their observed “head start” in disease severity, as our cross-sectional data from
young women without PCOS found higher (though normal range) testosterone levels to be associated with
NASH fibrosis. Whether elevated androgens underlie the risk of liver injury in PCOS, and the potential
mechanistic pathways by which this occurs, are not known. Our findings would support androgen receptor
antagonism as a potential therapeutic target for the large population of women with PCOS and liver disease.
Our central hypothesis is that androgens promote liver injury and NASH progression in PCOS, which occurs
through aberrant lipid activity (including lipotoxicity and dysregulated de novo lipogenesis), in part from
androgenic effects on visceral fat. Exogenous androgen use in women does increase visceral fat, which in turn
promotes NASH through several pathways, including production of lipotoxic lipid species. Androgens are also
linked to dysregulated branched-chain amino acid metabolism in PCOS, which is relevant as co-investigators
on our team have discovered an enzymatic imbalance that leads to dysregulated hepatic de novo lipogenesis
and NASH, and is reflected by serum levels of branched-chain amino and ketoacids.
Building upon these data, we propose a 2-center (UCSF and Duke) longitudinal study of 150 reproductive-
aged women with NASH (125 PCOS and 25 non-PCOS controls) to determine the influence of androgens on
liver injury and progression in PCOS and the mechanistic contributions of visceral adiposity (Aim 1) and
aberrant lipid metabolism (Aim 2) to this process. Aim 3 is a mechanistic proof-of-concept trial of 50 PCOS
participants to determine whether 24 weeks of androgen receptor blockade improves lipid metabolites that
reflect hepatic lipotoxicity and dysregulated de novo lipogenesis, respectively, as well as imaging-quantified
hepatic and visceral fat, and NASH histology. Leveraging our existing UCSF PCOS cohort and the established
infrastructures and collaborations between UCSF and Duke in NAFLD, PCOS, obesity, and lipid metabolism,
we are well positioned to accomplish the proposed aims. Impact of findings: Determining the contribution of
androgens to liver injury in PCOS and the underlying mechanistic pathways will support efficacy studies
evaluating androgen receptor antagonism for NASH, or the need to target lipid-specific pathways as a tailored
approach to halt NASH progression in this hormonally-distinct and metabolically high-risk population."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was discovered over 50 years ago because of research into the etiology of endemic
Burkitt lymphoma (BL). BL remains one of the most common and still frequently fatal pediatric cancers in sub-
Saharan Africa. A second critical co-factor in the etiology of BL is repeated infection with Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) malaria. The exact cellular and molecular events that link these two pathogens to increase the
risk for BL and drive the c-myc translocation characteristic of BL remain to be elucidated. Without this
information, our understanding of the etiology of BL, a cancer called the Rosetta Stone for deciphering viral
oncogenesis, remains incomplete. The overall goal of our research is to understand why children living in
malaria endemic regions are at high risk for BL. Based on our studies in Kenya where we found children living
in a malaria endemic region were infected with EBV early in life, had higher EBV viral loads over time and that
malaria exposure has an independent effect on increasing EBV viral loads in children. Combined, these data
point to an important role for malaria infection in dysregulating EBV latency. To account for the effects of
malaria on EBV-infected B cells, we are proposing a variation of the GC model, termed the “Dysequilibrium
model of EBV persistence.” In our model, the excess of heme released during malaria infection binds to the B
cell transcription factor, Bach2 suppressing its activity. Release of Bach2 mediated suppression allows Blimp1
to orchestrate plasma cell differentiation. EBV would reactivate in terminally differentiated plasma cells
resulting in viremia and an elevated population of secondarily infected B cells. An increased frequency of EBV-
infected B cells in and of itself is not necessarily problematic but we have also observed high levels of the
enzyme—activation induced deaminase (AID)—in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in children living
in a malaria endemic region and dysregulation of AID expression in B cell subsets during acute malaria. The
critical molecular event that defines BL is the translocation of the c-myc oncogene into the immunoglobulin
heavy chain locus, an event mediated by AID. Moreover, we show in our preliminary data that BAFF
synergizes with EBV to induce AID. Thus, the elevated population of latently infected B cells would be induced
to express AID increasing the risk for the c-myc translocation. Utilizing lymphocytes analyzed ex vivo, EBV+ B
cell lines, and in pediatric clinical samples from our field site in Kisumu, Kenya, we will test two key predictions
based on our model. First, that release of excessive heme by lysis of RBC during malaria results in EBV
reactivation in plasma cells and expansion of the latently infected B cell pool. Second, that increases in BAFF
during malaria results in aberrant AID expression in EBV-positive B cells. Dysregulation of EBV persistence
likely contributes not only to BL but also to other EBV-associated malignancies where co-factors are required
for emergence of disease. Lessons learned from studying the etiology of BL could potentially be used for
understanding the etiology of other EBV associated malignancies."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) screening remains suboptimal in spite of well-recognized, national screening guidelines.
In the US, 7.3 million adults with T2D and 74.5 with prediabetes (PDM) remain undiagnosed. In spite of
opportunistic screening in clinical practice, nearly one-third of primary care patients have undiagnosed
dysglycemia (PDM + T2D). To close screening gaps, new strategies are needed. We adapt evidence-based
approaches from cancer screening to conceptualize T2D screening as a multi-step process (risk assessment,
screening invitation, test ordering, and test completion) requiring coordination across patient, provider, and
health system interfaces. We previously developed the Parkland Dysglycemia Detection Program (PDDP) –
an EHR-based, multicomponent population health T2D screening intervention that automates risk assessment,
bulk orders screening tests, and facilitates bulk patient outreach via screening invitations. The PDDP closes
multiple gaps in the screening process and supplements opportunistic screening in clinical practice. In our
PDDP pilot study, a single, generic ‘overdue for screening’ invitation had a 41% response rate vs. 13% in usual
care alone. Of those completing screening, 37% had PDM and 5% had T2D, representing cases ‘missed’ by
opportunistic screening alone. Although the PDDP helped close overall screening gaps and detected cases of
undiagnosed dysglycemia, response rates to generic invitations were similar across racial/ethnic subgroups
(Hispanics 42%; NH Blacks 41%; NH whites 39%) and those with known PDM vs. unknown glycemic status
(38% vs. 41%). To address known screening and outcome disparities in racial/ethnic minorities and those with
PDM, equitable (not equal) screening is needed. In this proposal, we seek to improve the PDDP response in
racial/ethnic minorities and those with known PDM to achieve more equitable screening. To accomplish this,
we will develop Targeted (by race/ethnicity), Tailored (by known PDM vs. unknown glycemic state) (TT)
screening invitations (Aim 1) to increase engagement of high risk subgroups. We will then conduct a 3-arm
split-cluster RCT (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of PDDP-delivered TT screening outreach + navigation of
non-responders vs. PDDP-delivered generic invitations to improve screening completion in high risk patients
and evaluate the effectiveness of the TT PDDP and Generic PDDP to improve screening completion vs. usual
care, opportunistic screening. Lastly, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analyses (Aim 3) to compare direct
costs and the cost per patient screened and case found across the three study arms. Together, these findings
will provide actionable evidence on clinical and cost-effective ways to close screening gaps in high-risk
patients. Because the PDDP is highly automated and scalable using a common EHR, our findings can be
practically implemented in most health systems. Our findings will have important implications for clinics and
health systems seeking to close T2D screening gaps and decrease screening disparities through scalable,
population-health T2D screening strategies to supplement opportunistic screening in usual care."

The X-chromosome linked Neuroligin-4 (NLGN4) is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule (CAM) abundantly expressed in human cerebral cortex, however, its cellular function and molecular properties remain relatively unclear. Human NLGN4 consists of a unique amino-acid sequence that is not evolutionarily well-conserved in conventional rodent models, limiting our ability to investigate how this human-specific gene impacts synapse organization. This inherent species differences between diverse NLGN4 orthologs underscore the immediate need to generate a human model system to uncover its human-specific mechanisms. Recent technological advances in the fields of genetic engineering and epigenetic reprogramming of pluripotent stem cells provide us with a unique opportunity to examine the mechanistic properties of NLGN4, while maintaining the fidelity of human cellular context. In this proposal, we aim to utilize neuronal subtypes derived from human stem cells to assess our central hypotheses that NLGN4 plays an instructive role in defining the input-output parameters of excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses. We anticipate that NLGN4 establishes molecular interactions with a subset of synaptic proteins via its intra- and extracellular domains, which collectively regulate its proper maturation, trafficking, and function. Both the amino-acid sequence of different NLGN4 motifs as well as post-translational modifications at some those critical residues might play significant roles in determining its functional specificity. In aim 1: To inquire how NLGN4 can modulate synaptic network activity, we will either completely eliminate its endogenous expression in human neurons or introduce loss-of-function mutation, and inspect adverse effects on synaptic morphology and transmission using confocal imaging and electrophysiological recording. In Aim 2: We will determine how distinct amino-acid residues of NLGN4 can differentially regulate its characteristics, by performing systematic structure-function and biochemical analyses. In Aim 3: We will investigate how NLGN4’s binding to other synaptic proteins may define its functional identity, using rigorous co-immunoprecipitation, cell-aggregation, and proximity-dependent biotinylation assay. This project will essentially provide a comprehensive knowledge about NLGN4 function, its similarities and differences with other NLGNs. Using NLGN4 as a model, this extensive set of complementary approaches would also allow us to acquire fundamental information about human synaptic environment and how pre- or postsynaptic CAMs modulate its composition and activity."

The goal of this project is to provide the building blocks for an independent research program focused on the

neurons encoding these events in the ‘time in-between’. Reactivation of task-relevant neuronal ensembles occur
during both wake and sleep states, and enable the binding and compression of neuronal representations in a
temporal window compatible with neuronal plasticity. The role of awake and sleep reactivations in supporting
episodic, hippocampus-dependent memories is well established. However, reactivation have been reported to
also occur beyond the hippocampus, in both cortical and subcortical structures, and in both hippocampal-
dependent and -independent tasks. This leads to the exciting possibility that reactivations may be a fundamental
mechanism underlying memory formation and consolidation, and that they occur brain-wide, distributed among
regions encoding different modalities and variables. However, their role in cue-driven, goal-directed sensorimotor
tasks remain largely unexplored and evidence of multiregional reactivations is weak, in part because of technical
difficulty to investigate neuronal population activity across multiple simultaneously recorded brain circuits.
This proposal aims at testing the role of multi-region neuronal reactivations during wake and sleep in forming
and consolidating associative networks to support reward-based learning. In the K99 phase, Dr. Drieu will focus
on the role of multi-regional reactivation in cue-guided, goal-directed learning. She will test the hypothesis that
the simultaneous reactivation of stimulus-, action-, and reward-selective neurons across brain regions during the
waking state forms associative networks (Aim 1) subsequently reactivated during sleep for consolidation (Aim
2). In the R00 phase, Dr. Drieu will address whether transient synchronous activity spanning multiple brain areas
in different brain states participate in the transition from cue-driven, allocentric memories to egocentric memories
(Aim 3). To achieve these goals, Dr. Drieu will perform high-density, multi-site neuronal recordings using
Neuropixels 2.0 combined with advanced closed-loop optogenetic methods in freely moving rats. The technical
and scientific skills that Dr. Drieu will develop during the training period of this project will not only be crucial for
the accomplishment of her immediate scientific goals, they will also become the pillars for the research she will
develop in her own independent laboratory in the field of reward-based learning and memory. This training will
be complemented by intense career developmental activities and mentorship that will prepare her for the
practical aspects of laboratory management, teaching and fund raising. Overall, Dr. Drieu’s future research will
provide new insights into the neural mechanisms involved in memory formation. This will lay the groundwork to
better understand whether and how these mechanisms go awry in pathologies associated with reward-related
disorders such as addiction, and with memory deficits such as Alzheimer’s disease."
10722636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The central nervous system contains an enormous number of neurons that are interconnected to form the circuits
governing all brain functions. Neural circuits are built following a series of developmental steps such as neurite
guidance, target selection, and synapse formation. Cell surface proteins (CSPs) enable neurites to connect with
the correct synaptic partners. CSPs are not static within the membrane. They undergo dynamics and can be
cycled on and off of the membrane which influences how they respond to and control the physiological and
signaling events underlying neurodevelopment. Endocytosis internalizes CSPs from the membrane into the
cytosol and has dramatic effects on CSP signaling and function. However, CSP endocytosis has largely been
investigated in the context of a few known dynamic CSPs and mostly in culture systems. Though these
approaches are informative, we still do not know the identity and number of endocytosed CSPs within a given
developmental context or how their dynamics impact circuit assembly in vivo. The Drosophila olfactory system
displays stereotyped wiring and high genetic tractability, making it a powerful in vivo system to elucidate the role
and regulators of dynamic CSPs in circuit assembly. Here, ~57 distinct types of olfactory receptor neurons
(ORNs) project their axons from the periphery into the brain to make one-to-one synaptic connections with the
dendrites of ~57 corresponding types of projection neurons (PNs). This one-ORN-type-to-one-PN-type motif
creates ~57 distinct and invariant information relay channels called glomeruli. In fact, impairing CSP dynamics
disrupts olfactory circuit assembly, as well as the development of other sensory systems.
 The proposal will provide foundational insight into how CSP dynamics govern olfactory circuit assembly and
enable the candidate to build an independent research direction to pursue in her own lab. Specifically, the K99
phase of this application focuses on: 1) employing cutting-edge quantitative proteomics to profile dynamic CSPs
in ORNs and PNs in the developing brain; and 2) performing functional analyses to determine how CSP
endocytosis impacts circuit formation. This work will be completed under the guidance of world-renowned
neuroscientist, Dr. Liqun Luo (mentor), expert cell biologist, Dr. Kang Shen (co-mentor) and in collaboration with
leaders in proximity labeling, Dr. Alice Ting, and mass-spectrometry, Dr. Steven Carr. The R00 phase of this
proposal seeks to evaluate the intracellular mechanisms that control CSP dynamics by building upon expertise
gained from the mentored phase of this proposal.
 The research in the mentored and independent portions of this application is directly in line with NIDCD’s
mission to understand chemo-sensation and treat chemosensory disorders because elucidating the cellular
mechanisms controlling olfactory circuit assembly could enable us to ameliorate sensory circuit defects that arise
from disorders, injury, disease, or ageing."
10893559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is accompanied by the gradual deterioration within each individual cellular compartments/organelles as
well as the collapse of the interconnections among them, leading to the establishment of different hallmarks of
aging. However, these hallmarks of aging, including loss of proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular
senescence, are traditionally studied separately and leave the connections among these hallmarks largely un-
known. With a growing understanding of these inter-organelle interactions within young cells, it has become of
interest to explore how losses in compartmental crosstalk contribute to the age-associated degeneration of or-
ganelle function and the establishment/connection of hallmarks of aging.
 We recently discovered an unexpected crosstalk between mitochondria and the lysosome (vacuole in yeast)
that explains age-associated vacuole/lysosome de-acidification, a process conserved from yeast to human cells
and which contributes to the loss of proteostasis during aging and in many age-related diseases. We found that
mitochondria contribute to the acidification of lysosome/vacuole via membrane contact sites. Moreover, our pre-
liminary studies suggest that the collapse of mitochondria-vacuole contact during the replicative aging of yeast
causes age-dependent de-acidification of vacuole. Similarly, we observed a close correlation between mitochon-
dria and lysosome acidification in cultured human cells and in C. elegans, suggesting evolutionary conservation
of this process. To address how aging affects the mitochondria-lysosome/vacuole contact and whether this mi-
tochondria-to-lysosome axis plays a critical role in lysosome acidification in cellular senescence and animals, we
here propose to investigate the mitochondria-lysosome/vacuole contact and lysosome/vacuole acidification dur-
ing aging and in different longevity paradigms. Specifically, we will combine the expertise of our different model
systems to (1) dissect the mechanism(s) underlying the age-related loss of mitochondria-vacuole connection in
yeast; (2) determine mitochondrial contribution to lysosome acidification in human cells; and (3) dissect the roles
of mitochondria-lysosome connection in lysosome acidification in C. elegans.
 Our studies will investigate a novel, possibly evolutionarily conserved inter-organelle communication connect-
ing mitochondrial dysfunction and lysosome/vacuole de-acidification across different organisms and longevity
paradigms. Although traditional thinking has held that age-associated lysosome/vacuole dysfunction is respon-
sible for inducing mitochondrial dysfunction in a uni-directional manner, our study will determine whether mito-
chondrial dysfunction may conversely impact on lysosome/vacuole dysfunction during aging revealing a here-
to-fore unappreciated two-way crosstalk between these tightly connected organelles which may together con-
tribute to several important hallmarks of aging. As such, the long-term implications of this study could be the
identification of novel conserved therapeutic targets for age-related diseases with lysosome defects."
10932256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Historically marginalized populations such as people of color, low-income people, and immigrant
populations disproportionately face barriers to reproductive healthcare. Telehealth options for
reproductive health care services are growing and may address some of the distance and cost barriers
to access. Research on telehealth for primary care suggests that it may bridge geographic disparities,
allow for easier language translations, feel safer and more private for immigrant populations, be less
expensive, and require less time off work or school. Conversely, telehealth services could exacerbate
inequities if patients lack technology, digital literacy, and reliable internet coverage. Our long-term goal
is to reduce disparities in healthcare access and to optimize telehealth for groups historically
marginalized from healthcare including people of color, low-income people, and immigrants. The goal of
this research is to determine whether telehealth provides patients with more timely and affordable
reproductive healthcare, whether telehealth reaches people in areas with greater health inequities, and
which attributes of telehealth patients prefer.
 The Telehealth and Reproductive Health Equity study will enroll 2,000 patients seeking
reproductive health care. One cohort will comprise 1,000 patients seeking telehealth or in-person
services through the clinic sites. A second cohort of 1,000 patients searching for a reproductive
healthcare provider online will be recruited using Google Ads. In Aim 1 we will determine the ways in
which telehealth services affect timing, costs, and follow-up care relative to in-person care. We will also
compare rates of unplanned in-person care between telehealth and in-person groups. The cohorts
recruited from clinics and via Google Ads will be analyzed separately. In Aim 2 we will conduct a
geospatial analysis of patient census block groups or tracts to determine whether compared to patients
using in-person care for abortion care, patients using telehealth reside in areas with greater health
inequities. We will compare the telehealth and in-person groups using four social vulnerability indices.
In Aim 3 we will determine preferences in and barriers to telehealth for reproductive healthcare,
focusing on historically marginalized populations. We will use two innovative methods traditionally used
for market research, the discrete choice experiment and maximum difference analysis.
 This research addresses substantial and increasing disparities in access to healthcare in
historically marginalized groups. The results of the proposed research will provide clear guidance on
how health care providers can design telehealth services so that they are accessible and attractive to
people of color, low-income people, and immigrants. Our results will contribute to digital inclusion and
increased health access and will be applicable to all areas of healthcare."

 Testicular cancer diagnosis and treatment, especially given its threat to sexuality and reproductive health,
can be distressing in the formative period of young adulthood. Cohort studies reveal the prevalence of
depressive symptoms in testicular cancer exceeds the general population. In fact, the majority of young adult
cancer survivors will experience impairing, distressing, and modifiable physical, behavioral, and psychosocial
adverse outcomes that persist long after the completion of primary medical treatment. These include
psychological distress, impairment in the navigation and pursuit of life goals, persistent side effects, elevated
risk of secondary malignancies and chronic illness, and biobehavioral burden (e.g., enhanced inflammation,
dysregulated stress hormones) which influence morbidity and disease-related vulnerabilities. However, few
targeted, effective interventions exist to assist young survivors in re-negotiating life goals and regulating
cancer-related emotions and none focus on reducing the burden of morbidity via biobehavioral mechanisms.
 Young or “emerging” adulthood is a period marked by goal attainment. Chronic illness experienced as “off
time” in the lifespan interrupts goal pursuits and threatens valued life directions. As young adults return to goal
pursuits, re-entry to post-cancer life can be a critical point in the survivorship trajectory. Behavioral intervention
at this time is well positioned to confer longer-term impact. Emergent from our group’s preliminary research, we
developed and pilot-tested Goal-focused Emotion-Regulation Therapy (GET) as a novel behavioral
intervention to enhance self-regulation through improved goal navigation skills, improved sense of purpose,
and better ability to regulate emotional responses in young adults with testicular cancer. GET is a promising
candidate intervention to address the mechanisms likely complicating the resolution of cancer-related burden.
 Responsive the need for feasible, effective, and scalable interventions, we will randomly allocate 300
young adult (ages 18-39) testicular cancer patients to 6 sessions of GET or ISL (individual supportive
listening), and evaluate primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up, and
6-months follow-up. We predict that GET will be associated with superior distress outcomes and comparatively
greater reductions in adverse biobehavioral indicators (dysregulated diurnal stress hormones, elevated
inflammation), and these advantages will be maintained at three- and six-months following intervention. The
intervention will be delivered via video conferencing to enhance access. An exploratory aim focuses on
potential epigenetic vulnerabilities, to understand how environmental influences (via DNA methylation) on
genes implicated in stress and mood regulation are related to cancer adjustment and intervention response.
 This study capitalizes on the study team’s unique expertise in biobehavioral oncology and salivary
bioscience to test a novel behavioral intervention for young adult survivors. It has potential to understand how
to alter proximal behavioral, biological, and psychological factors that underscore long term adverse effects."

Fibrosis is the final common pathway in chronic liver disease that leads to liver failure, and is characterized by
an imbalance of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling. There are currently no FDA-approved
therapies to target this endpoint of chronic liver disease. Moreover, there is a paucity of biomarkers that reflect
disease-specific pathways in patients. Development of new therapeutics and biomarkers for patients with hepatic
fibrosis is a critical unmet need. Our long-term goal is to develop antifibrotic therapies for the treatment of hepatic
fibrosis and to develop biomarkers to define the patient populations that would benefit most from these therapies.
Our prior studies discovered an antifibrotic target, the enzyme acid ceramidase (aCDase). Targeting aCDase
ameliorates fibrosis by inhibiting YAP/TAZ, key effectors of the Hippo pathway, and promotes ECM remodeling.
We developed a signature score of genes downregulated by ceramide, the Ceramide Responsiveness score
(CRS), and demonstrated that the CRS is increased in patients with advanced fibrosis. Despite the fact that
targeting aCDase in HSCs ameliorates activation in culture and ablating its expression prevents liver fibrosis in
vivo, chronic ceramide accumulation may have untoward side effects. The overall objective of the proposal is to
clarify the mechanisms by which ceramide regulates YAP/TAZ, ECM remodeling, and hepatic fibrosis. We also
seek to validate the CRS as a pathway-specific biomarker in patients with hepatic fibrosis. The rationale for this
project is that understanding the mechanisms of ceramide-mediated attenuation of HSC activation and hepatic
fibrosis will offer a strong scientific framework to facilitate the development of antifibrotic therapeutics and
biomarkers for patients. To achieve this objective, this proposal has three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism by which ceramide regulates Hippo signaling. In specific aim 2, we will characterize
how ceramide regulates ECM remodeling. Specific aims 1 and 2 will be achieved by gain of function and loss of
function techniques in vitro and testing HSC-specific knockout mice. In specific aim 3, we will analyze the
correlation between the CRS, fibrosis stage, and fibrosis progression using deidentified human liver samples,
and will identify clinical characteristics that correlate with the CRS. The mechanistic understanding to be gained
from the successful completion of the proposed studies promises to reveal new targets for rational disease
modification in hepatic fibrosis, a disease with limited treatment options available. Furthermore, by clarifying
molecular mechanisms and defining a pathway-specific signature, our work will facilitate a personalized medicine
approach for patients with hepatic fibrosis."
10894892,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Compared to Whites, African American/Blacks (AA/B) have a substantially higher (40-50%) colorectal cancer
(CRC) mortality rate that is a function of both higher incidence and lower survival rates. Our long-term goal is
to understand the differences in immune response that influence this disparity in CRC mortality. Emerging
studies suggest alterations in T cell presence and function in AA/B contribute to CRC disparities, and AA/B CRC
patients with low immune infiltrate have particularly poor outcomes. We have found that AA/B CRC patients have
disproportionally reduced tumoral MHC class I expression compared with White patients. As MHC class I is
critical for presentation of tumor antigens to CD8+ T cells, these results suggest a critical immune mediated
mechanism that drives the differences in survival times between AA/B and White patients. The objectives of
this project are to understand the mechanisms relevant to T cell alterations within the tumors of AA/B versus
White patients and to develop improved biomarkers and therapies to reduce CRC racial disparities. Our central
hypothesis is that reduced tumoral MHC class I expression drives T cell alterations to enhance tumoral immune
escape in CRC from AA/B patients compared with White patients. To test this hypothesis, we have developed
robust multispectral imaging capability for studying the relationship between MHC class I expression and CD8+
T cell frequency, localization, phenotype, and function. In parallel, we have developed an autologous humanized
CRC TIL-PDX mouse model, created with matched patient-derived tumor and tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) to
investigate CRC disparities. This completely unique approach will be undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team,
which includes a surgeon-scientist with expertise in CRC oncology, a cancer immunologist, and a cancer
disparities basic researcher. In Aim 1, we will define CD8+ T cell biology in the context of tumoral MHC class I
loss in AA/B versus White CRC patients. We will perform both multispectral imaging of archival tumor samples
and phenotypical/ functional studies of fresh samples to define essential differences between AA/B and White
tumors. In Aim 2, we will evaluate whether TIL-PDX mice generated from AA/B versus White CRC tumors exhibit
differential T cell biology and anti-tumor immunity in the context of tumoral MHC class I expression. We expect
that the use of the CRC TIL-PDX mouse model will recapitulates a patients’ tumor immunity in a manner not
previously possible to determine the differences in immune mediated processes. In Aim 3, we will assess the
ability of IL-15 as a therapy to overcome AA/B tumoral MHC class I loss using a syngeneic CRC tumor-bearing
mice. The positive impact of this work will be an improved understanding of the differences in immune-mediated
mechanisms to understand disparities associated with CRC patient outcomes and to develop a therapeutic
approach to help AA/B CRC patients."
10897938,"This project focuses on three categories of small RNAs: the isoforms of microRNAs (miRNAs) that are known
as isomiRs; the fragments that are derived from transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and are known as tRFs; and, the frag-
ments that are derived from ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and are known as rRFs.
 IsomiR, tRFs, and rRFs have several important properties that warrant their detailed study: (1) They account
for ~80% of all small RNAs in a cell. (2) They regulate the abundance of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and pro-
teins. (3) Their expression patterns depend on cellular “context” (e.g., tissue type, disease type). (4) In hu-
mans, their expression patterns additionally depend on “personal attributes” (e.g., sex, genetic ancestry, age).
 To correctly mine isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs from RNA-seq data the ideal tools must address several compli-
cating factors. First, the same short sequence (e.g., tRF) can arise from different parental RNAs. These parental
RNAs can belong to the same sub-type (e.g., different tRNA isodecoders of the same tRNA isoacceptor) or
different sub-types (e.g., isodecoders from different tRNA isoacceptors). Second, the sequences of many iso-
miRs, tRFs, and rRFs can also be found in unrelated regions of the genome. Third, paralogues and/or incomplete
copies of miRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs riddle the nuclear genomes of many organisms including human and
mouse. The details of these complicating factors are specific to the RNA type and to the genome. Consequently,
the ideal tools must be target-genome-specific.
 The complicating factors and the need for genome specificity appeared in the literature only recently. As a
result, most available tools to date have been general-purpose and do not account for these complications. Not
surprisingly, most available databases were built using general-purpose tools. Without realizing the underlying
shortcomings, many researchers relied on the information provided by these tools and databases to design
experiments and analyze their data. In turn, this has led to many published articles that unintentionally describe
findings of unclear value about molecules that are not always isomiRs, tRFs, or rRFs.
 We will address these gaps as follows. In Aim 1, we will build specialized tools that address the peculiarities
of each RNA type and accurately mine isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs from human and mouse RNA-seq data. The
tools will be robust, self-contained, and user-friendly. In Aim 2, we will build specialized databases to organize
and provide easy access to information about isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs that we have already compiled by mining
50,000 public datasets. In Aim 3, we will build a system that auto-identifies newly-added datasets to NIH’s SRA,
profiles and annotates each dataset’s isomiRs, tRFs, and rRFs, and updates the databases with the new infor-
mation each month. In Aim 4, we will create educational material describing best practices to help researchers
benefit maximally from this framework, and build a system to allow them to interact with one another and submit
their feedback. Lastly, we will validate experimentally select small RNAs implicated in breast cancer metastasis."

One of the greatest mysteries in ageing biology is to understand why many tissues and organs in our body,
including skeletal muscle, decline in function as we get older? Recent studies suggest that the inability of
muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to turn on the repair program after trauma is a major factor leading to the loss of
muscle mass and strength observed in the elderly. However, given that the signals driving MuSCs into the
regenerative state remains a mystery even in young adults, we are left with virtually no therapeutic options for
boosting the repair potential of aging MuSCs in the clinic. To address this unmet need, my laboratory recently
discovered a new “Super-Healing” adult stem cell activation program, driven by the transcription factor, FBJ
osteosarcoma oncogene (FOS), that speeds up adult stem cell activation and enhances muscle repair.
Intriguingly, a key downstream target gene of FOS in adult MuSCs is the NAD-consuming, cell surface
enzyme, ADP-Ribosyl-Transferase 1 (Art1), which attaches an understudied post-translational modification
(PTM), mono-ADP-Ribosylation (MARylation), to protein substrates. Excitingly, our preliminary data suggests
that the FOS/ART1-MARylation pathway is disrupted in aged MuSCs, and thus, representing one of the
earliest molecular alterations that diminish the regenerative potential of aged skeletal muscle. Thus, in this
proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the FOS/AP-1 tissue regenerative program (including the ART1
pathway) is mis-regulated in aged skeletal muscle, triggering a cascade of molecular events that dampen stem
cell activation potential and lead to the progressive deterioration of skeletal muscle with increasing age; and
most importantly, that reversal of this molecular dysfunction will correct the stem cell activation and
regenerative deficits seen in aged skeletal muscle. In Aim1, we will determine the expression patterns and
functional significance of FOS/AP-1 gene targets in adult and aged MuSCs. In Aim2, we will determine the
expression dynamics, functional requirements, and MARylated protein substrates of the newly discovered
NAD/ART1-MARylation stem cell activation pathway in adult and aged MuSCs. Collectively, this work will
highlight a new FOS/NAD/ART1-MARylation stem cell activation pathway that has been largely ignored in
aging biology until now and whose further study will open new therapeutic avenues for improving muscle
health in the elderly population."
10906945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 High provider workload is a threat to care quality, patient safety, and providers’ well-being and job
satisfaction. Workload – which lacks a universally accepted definition - is a complex multi-dimensional
construct that is affected by external task demands and environmental, organizational, and psychological
factors. The importance of managing high workload is nowhere more evident than in neonatal intensive care
units (NICUs). Critically ill neonates are highly vulnerable to iatrogenic events due to their immaturity and
fragility, and high clinician workload has been directly associated with increased incidence of adverse neonatal
safety outcomes.
 Despite the evidence and need, patient safety researchers have been slow to develop multi-level models,
scalable workload measurement systems, or other health information technology interventions to improve
workload management and patient safety. Conventional workload management tools predominantly measure
and predict workload using unit-level (e.g., staffing ratios) or patient-level (e.g., acuity) data rather than data
collected across the four levels of workload recommended by human factors engineers (HFEs) - unit, job,
patient, and situation. As a result, current tools under-measure the workload experienced by providers and are
not designed to identify mutable microsystem factors that contribute most to provider workload.
 A promising development in workload research is the increasing emphasis on measuring situational
workload which best explains the workload experienced by clinicians due to healthcare microsystem design.
Situational workload is most affected by performance obstacles (i.e., delays, interruptions, etc.) in the local
work environment and can be applied at the unit, job, or patient-levels. Most importantly, it is diagnostic of
underlying contributory factors and therefore actionable for improvement. To date, situational workload has
been measured using subjective surveys which are work-interrupting, thus difficult to integrate into practice.
 Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), in collaboration Johns Hopkins University (JHU),
will employ a systems engineering human-centered design process to design, develop, and validate
new multi-level model of NICU nurse practitioner workload derived from readily accessible electronic
health record (EHR) data. The validated model will be the foundation for a future EHR-based clinical
decision support (CDS) tool that will track the real-time workload of NICU providers, predict near-
term future unit workload, and guide workload reduction and balancing interventions. The project’s
three Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To conduct a comprehensive HFE-based analysis of NICU provider
(i.e., neonatal nurse practitioner) workload; Aim 2. To design and develop real-time multivariable
workload models and Aim 3. To validate the real-time workload models at VUMC (A) and to
determine the generalizability of the models at an external hospital (B)."

complex Arp2/3, and the motor protein myosin II. Our probes aimed at F-actin and G-actin are
derived from the natural products jasplakinolide, yielding opto-Jasp, cytochalasin D (opto-Chal),

CK-666 (opto-CK) and the photoswitchable myosin 2 inhibitors from blebbistatin and similar
compounds (opto-MI). We have already obtained significant preliminary results in a variety of
cells (e.g. yeast, HeLa, neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia). Our proposed program constitutes
the continuation of our long-standing and successful program on optically controlling actin and
tubulin, as well as associated motor proteins with photoswitchable small molecules. The close

10732529,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 4
Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) are on the rise globally and pose serious health concerns due to
the release of cyanotoxins, which are harmful to both humans and the environment. Microcystin-leucine
arginine (MC-LR) and Microcystin-leucine alanine (MC-LA), two of the most toxic congeners of microcystin
produced by cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis, have recently been shown to have the highest
concentration in lake aerosol particles. Adverse health effects following exposure to aerosolized MC-LA remain
largely unknown. In the literature and our preliminary data, it has been observed that aerosolized MC-LR
exposure of the airways leads to mixed granulocytic inflammation, with abundant indications of a Type 1
neutrophilic response. Granulocytic inflammation drives 4 of the 5 endotypes of asthma, which is the most
common airway condition in the world and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and
stroke. However, the impact that aerosolized MC-LA and MC-LR exposure may have on the over 330 million
patients with pre-existing asthma remains unknown. Furthermore, Microcystis constitutes just one subset of a
host of toxin-producing species and complex mixtures of toxins in freshwater systems whose health effects are
largely unknown. Therefore, the overall hypothesis is that exposure to aerosolized cyanotoxins induces
significant inflammation in the airway epithelium and that individuals with asthma are particularly susceptible to
cHAB aerosols. To address this hypothesis in Aim 1 we will interrogate the effects of MCs, such as MC-LA,
MC-LR, as well as novel freshwater extracts from P1-3 on cell growth, inflammation and metabolism in primary
cells and cell lines derived from physiologically distinct regions on the human respiratory tract from asthmatic
and non-asthmatic subjects. For Aim 2, an established pre-existing asthma model will be exposed to
aerosolized MC-LR and MC-LA (alone and in combination) for evaluation of pulmonary inflammation and
toxicity in downstream target organ systems. In Aim 3, a prospective cohort study will be performed in
individuals that live, work, and recreate in the Western Lake Erie basin for the assessment of pulmonary
function immediately before, during, and after cHAB seasons. Results from this study will provide targeted
mechanistic data and will define host absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) routes of
toxins. In addition, with the Community Engagement Core (CEC), we will inform communities around the world
of the risks associated with exposure to aerosolized cyanotoxins, and how these environmental toxins may
worsen disease in at-risk populations, potentially influencing local, state, and national policies to protect people
living on or around affected bodies of water, as well as provide critical information to healthcare professionals."
10732582,"ABSTRACT: Human health is inextricably tied to the Great Lakes, which hold 20% of the Earth’s surface
freshwater. Climate change is impacting the Lakes, altering water temperature, pH, storm frequency, ice cover,
and precipitation. Human debris, including plastic, also impacts the Lakes and those who rely on it. Plastic enters
the Lakes as microplastic (MP; particles <5 mm) or as macrodebris that may degrade to MP. There are significant
knowledge gaps about the cycle of plastic in the Lakes, but MPs have been found in all lake habitats, throughout
the food chain, and in tap water. The potential human health effects of Lake-associated exposure to MP are
vastly understudied. How MP inputs and impacts will be affected by climate change is also unknown. Addressing
such complex problems requires engaging diverse community partners and a multidisciplinary systems science
approach. The over-arching goal of the Lake Ontario Center for Microplastics and Human Health in a Changing
Environment is to prevent negative human health impacts of MP in the context of climate change in the Great Lakes
by engaging diverse partners in research, promoting environmental health literacy, and promoting solutions.
Because the Lake Ontario region is representative of the Great Lakes basin, our work will be broadly transferable.
Our innovative approach assesses plastics as they exist in the environment: as mixtures of post-consumer plastic
polymers, degraded by the environment, and covered with biofilm. A major challenge of MP research is
standardization of materials and methods, which we address with a novel Materials and Metrology Core that
supports and is integral to all 3 research projects. Project 1 will holistically assess projected climate
change impacts on plastic input, degradation, ecotoxicity, and microorganisms in plastic-associated biofilms.
Project 1 culminates in modeling to predict future input, fate and transport of microplastics in Lake Ontario.
Project 2 will build on Project 1’s foundation to assess the potential for dermal and lung exposure to MPs by
leveraging nanomembrane technologies to analyze mammalian cytotoxicity and bioactivity of natural and
experimental particle mixtures in combination with variation in temperature and availability of metals and
persistent organic pollutants. Project 3 extends the investigation to the whole organism by using the
amphibian Xenopus to rigorously assess the biodistribution of MPs and impacts on development, fitness,
immune homeostasis and antiviral immunity, under varied conditions of temperature. Given the high degree of
evolutionary conservation of vertebrate physiology, the outcomes from this study are very relevant to human
health. Our Community Engagement Core involves diverse partners in all aspects of the Center, including
community science, direct action, development and dissemination of materials, and building partners’ capacity
to promote solutions. Our Administrative Core coordinates across two institutions (the University of Rochester
and the Rochester Institute of Technology), supports multidirectional communication with external stakeholders,
oversees our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives, and evaluates progress toward Center goals."

oversight; 2) coordination and communication about the Center to maximize its interaction with and impact on
external research, engagement, and translation; 3) evaluation of the Center to provide ongoing feedback and
quality improvement with respect to all its goals, including the Plan to Enhance Diverse Perspectives. Because
of the inherent complexity of research and engagement around microplastics (MPs) and human health, we have
carefully structured an Administrative team and structures to coordinate between two institutions (the University of
Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology), multidisciplinary researchers, the central role of the Materials
and Metrology Core (MMC), and engagement with diverse partners. Our internal coordination will be facilitated by
an Internal Steering Committee which will meet monthly, along with quarterly “All Hands” meetings to encourage
interaction among all members of the Center, including trainees, staff, and faculty, and monthly meetings of the
Microplastics Research Workgroup of Western New York. The Administrative Team supports multi-directional
interactions with external stakeholders by facilitating the Lake Ontario MicroPlastics Engagement and Research
(LOMPER) group, comprised of organizations with significant roles in management, policy, or public decisions
related to MPs. Core A also manages communications with and annual meetings of our External Advisory
Committee, co-hosting an annual Regional Microplastics Research Workshop, and facilitating presentations about
Center research with diverse academic audiences. The Administrative Team has dedicated effort to comprehensive
formative evaluation and feedback on all aspects of the Center. In addition to standard measures of research
progress success, such as publications and presentations, we will monitor use of the MMC, document non-
scholarly products (e.g. news media, CEC materials, science briefs), engagement of Center members in CEC
activities, and progress in implementing our Plan to Enhance Diverse Perspectives. Findings will be reporting on
a regular basis to the Internal Steering Committee, LOMPER, and External Advisory Committees to inform future
activities."

Pragmatic (i.e., social) language deficits are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which can
impose significant burden on individuals throughout the lifespan. Strong evidence also suggests that this clinical
domain is influenced by genetic liability to ASD in unaffected relatives, constituting a principal component of the
broad autism phenotype (BAP) and linked with increased polygenic risk for ASD in unaffected relatives.
Pragmatic language features of ASD also show significant overlap with phenotypes observed in carriers of FMR1
mutations, implicating this highly penetrant ASD risk gene in the pragmatic language phenotype of ASD in
particular. The pragmatic language domain is therefore not only highly clinically significant in ASD, but also
sensitive to underlying ASD genetic liability, making this skill an important target for understanding the biological
origins of ASD and its component features, with potentially important clinical applications. In this competing
renewal, we will apply innovative deep phenotyping methods and an armamentarium of complementary analytic
platforms to dissect the contributors to pragmatic language impairments in ASD and their biological basis. Using
a family-study design and including a representative ASD cohort enriched for girls, ASD parents, and respective
control groups, we will characterize ASD-related pragmatic profiles that extend beyond traditional, categorically-
defined diagnostic boundaries, which may be linked with distinct neural signatures and molecular genetic
variation. Aim 1 will apply both hypothesis- and data-driven analytic approaches to analyze a comprehensive
battery assessing component skills contributing to pragmatic impairments in ASD, and subclinical pragmatic
differences in the BAP among parents. Aim 2 will employ a battery of targeted electrophysiological measures to
examine potential neural correlates of pragmatic impairment in ASD and the BAP. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate
the relationship between behavioral and neural phenotypic signatures obtained in Aims 1 and 2, respectively,
and FMR1-related genetic variation. Our preliminary studies demonstrated a complex network of skills
contributing to pragmatic impairments in ASD that may be sensitively measured with the advanced fine-grained
computational- and machine-learning-based approaches proposed in this project, with compelling ties to
neurophysiological and molecular genetic correlates that will be measured in this project. Together, the rich and
extensive data produced will contribute to the understanding of the fine-grained skills that contribute to the
heterogeneity in ASD, and the mechanistic and biological origins of this important clinical domain. Our findings
will move us closer to achieving our long-term translational goal: to advance our understanding of the causes of
the pragmatic language impairment in ASD in order to improve prediction of clinical outcomes and help guide
future interventions and treatment in ASD."

Black/African Americans have the highest rate of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States
but evidence on risk and resiliency factors for ADRD is based almost exclusively on non-Hispanic Whites. The Study of
Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR) was initiated in 2017 (RF1AG050782) as a lifecourse cohort study of
cognitive ageing in middle aged and elderly Black individuals who are long-term members of Kaiser Permanente
Northern California. Recently established, STAR is one of the largest all Black cohort studies with prospective clinical,
lifestyle, and behavioral data from 1960s - present. Cycle 1of STAR accomplished key goals including commencement of
the cohort and enrollment of 764 Black individuals (mean age 69, range 53-95; 66% female) with 3 research visits
approximately 15 months apart. All waves included an extensive neuropsychology battery along with survey collection of
psychosocial factors, stress, discrimination, occupation, and an array of health, behavioral and functional measures, 233
participants had a brain MRI. STAR Cycle 1 has contributed key findings about cognitive aging in the Black population
and set up an unprecedented infrastructure enabling linkage of early-life data and medical records to investigate predictors
of cognitive decline, neurodegeneration and vascular injury. STAR participants display a wide array of life experiences
and resiliency: 47% attended college, 80% reporting everyday discrimination, 57% with mothers < high school education,
28% financial problems in childhood while 4% in adulthood, 39% attended segregated schools, and 36% had >1
cardiovascular risk factor in young adulthood. Key findings from Cycle 1 include: 1) school segregation and timing of
desegregation is associated with differences in late-life cognition; 2) hypertension, obesity, and hyperlipidemia in
adolescence, young adulthood, and midlife are associated with poorer cognitive performance and more vascular brain
injury; 3) birth in a stroke-belt state is associated with poorer cognitive function; 4) parental education and childhood
socioeconomic status are associated with cognitive performance; and 5) attending a school with mostly Black students is
associated with lower depressive symptoms in later life. The establishment of STAR in Cycle 1 sets the infrastructure for
an unprecedented continuing study of the transition to ADRD and identification of lifetime factors that can reduce risk of
cognitive impairment in Black older adults. In this completive renewal for Cycle 2 of STAR our aims are: Aim 1a: Enroll
an additional 400 individuals into STAR to determine age and sex-specific incident ADRD and domain specific cognitive
decline in a cohort of Black individuals. Aim1b: Evaluate lifecourse risk and protective factors of ADRD and cognitive
decline in this cohort. Aim 2: Collect blood-based biomarkers consistent with the ATN framework (Aβ 42/40, total Tau
and phosphoTau-181, neurofilament light [NfL], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and evaluate their contribution to
ADRD and cognitive decline in a cohort of Black individuals. Aim 3a: Determine the contribution of lifecourse risk and
protective factors on neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration, atrophy, and vascular injury change in 300 Black
individuals. Aim 3b: Determine the contribution of neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration, atrophy, and vascular
injury change on cognitive decline and ADRD in a Black cohort. Aim 4a: Initiate a brain donation program in STAR and
characterize the spectrum of neuropathology in a cohort of Black participants. Aim 4b. Evaluate predictors of interest,
consent, and participation in the brain donation program."

This K23 application resubmission describes the background and experience of the applicant, Shena
Gazaway, PhD, RN, and her plan to acquire the necessary skills to become a leading independent scientist
focused on developing and testing stakeholder, early health-related decision support interventions to improve
upstream decision-making among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their family caregivers. The
proposed research is critical because: 1) persons living with CKD and their family members have numerous
unmet needs related to health-related decision-making, and 2) sparse prior work has examined the
mechanisms underlying health-related decision-making or investigated which stakeholder-informed
intervention components can result in positive effects while also being scalable. The specific training objectives
for the K23 are to gain advanced expertise and skills in: 1) leading the design, conduct, and statistical analysis
of optimization clinical trials within the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework; 2) developing
stakeholder-informed, early decision support interventions with advanced CKD populations; and 3) training in
advanced ethics in human subjects research. Meeting these training objectives will enable Dr. Gazaway to
achieve the overall goal of the K23 to conduct a pilot randomized 23 factorial trial to test components of an
early health-related decision support training intervention –ImPart (Improving Decisional Partnership for CKD
dyads) for adults living with stage 4 CKD and their caregivers. The goal of ImPart will be to train the CKD dyad
with the decision partnership and communication skills necessary to navigate advanced CKD as activated
partners before facing major health-related decisions (e.g., kidney transplant, dialysis, end-of-life decisions). A
comprehensive training plan has been developed under the guidance of the mentorship team of senior
research experts. The plan includes intensive one-on-one mentorship, formal coursework/workshops, clinical
trial observerships, and conference attendance. In partnership with a 6-member stakeholder group (CKD
patients, caregivers, and clinicians), we will finalize ImPart components and component levels for piloting. The
specific aims of this K23 are - 1) to determine acceptability & feasibility of the refined intervention components
in a sample of 64 dyads over 24 weeks using a pilot factorial design and 2) to explore the preliminary efficacy
of individual intervention components on patient and caregiver outcomes over 24 weeks on decisional conflict
(primary outcome). The results from these proposed activities will directly support an R01 application to
conduct a fully powered MOST factorial trial to test the effects of individual ImPart components on CKD patient
and caregiver outcomes."

The primary goal of this proposal is to understand how conformational properties of the major pathogenesis
factor of E. coli - most common, type 1 fimbrial adhesin of E. coli - defines its ability to elicit a protective
antibody response as a vaccine candidate against urinary tract infections caused by E. coli. FimH is an
adhesive subunit of the type 1 fimbriae and is one of the major factors in the ability of E. coli to bing human
urothelium and cause urinary tract infection. We determined that the mannose-binding lectin domain of FimH
can assume two conformational states - with a high- and low-affinity towards terminally-exposed mannosyl
residues. The conformational shift in FimH is highly dynamic in nature and is the basis of the ability of FimH to
mediate shear-enhanced bacterial adhesion, bind fast and strongly human cell receptors and shed bound
antibodies. We intend to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of antibodies against both
conformational states of FimH to analyze the conformational switch in FimH in the context of the immune
response against the adhesive protein."

10914284,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Stillbirth, fetal death occurring at least 20 weeks’ gestation, is one of the most common adverse pregnancy
outcomes, affecting over 3 million pregnancies per year worldwide. Stillbirth leads to substantial economic and
emotional burden on affected families and the health care system. Women experiencing stillbirth are at
increased risk of its recurrence and other obstetric complications in subsequent pregnancies. Though an
etiology may be found in some couples, stillbirth is unexplained in about 50% of cases. Sadly, emotional
ordeals for families are exacerbated by widespread misconceptions about unexplained stillbirths, such as it
being a rare occurrence, and by increased feelings of self-blame and guilt. Apart from infrequent aneuploidies,
underlying causal genetic factors of unexplained cases are largely unknown.
 Recently, we showed that stillbirth aggregates in families, suggesting that investigating genes in high-risk
familial stillbirth pedigrees will reveal important insights into pathogenic heritable genes. Additionally, by whole-
exome sequencing (WES) of maternal-offspring dyads, we identified small genetic abnormalities that were
previously impossible to ascertain.However, the results from our WES analysis pose many challenges for
interpretation and identification of pathogenic variants affecting regulatory elements or a large and diverse set
of genes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) analysis of DNA from both parents, stillbirths, and live births,
offers the opportunity to comprehensively detect a complete set of genetic abnormalities (e.g., single-
nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion/deletions, and structural variants, including the rest of the genome that
are biochemically active). In a pilot WGS study using DNA from parents, unexplained recurrent fetal death
including stillbirths, and live births, we showed that inherited and newly occurring, i.e., de novo variants may
be relevant to fetal death. With a larger WGS study and novel shared risk variants analyses in pedigrees, we
can identify inherited and de novo variants as causal and contributory factors for stillbirth. The findings will lead
to improved risk stratification and discovery of novel pathophysiologic pathways and therapeutic targets.
Therefore, we propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify novel inherited variants relevant to familial
and recurrent stillbirth, Aim 2) Identify de novo variants that are part of the ‘intolerome’ and relevant to
sporadic stillbirth. We will conduct WGS analysis using DNA from both parents and their offspring (stillbirths
and live births). The scientific aims of this study are complemented and enhanced by the proposed team’s
overall commitment and expertise in the field of reproductive medicine and in stillbirth genetic research as well
as existing IRB-approved data and samples. Our study will have a significant impact by providing an
explanation for stillbirth, facilitating bereavement and emotional closure, and advancing the discovery of
biomarkers for risk-stratification."

We recently published in vitro studies identifying Fidgetin-like 2 (FL2) as a novel regulator of microtubule
dynamics, with an inhibitory effect on axonal growth and nerve regeneration [1]. Since FL2-depletion had axonal
growth-promoting effects in vitro, we tested whether FL2 could be targeted to promote nerve regeneration in a
rodent model of cavernous nerve (CN) injury. The CNs are parasympathetic nerves that regulate blood flow to
the penis and are commonly damaged during the surgical procedures of radical prostatectomy (RP), resulting in
erectile dysfunction (ED). Remarkably, in these rodent models, FL2-depletion at the site and time of CN injury
led to accelerated visible nerve regeneration, accompanied by improved erectile function outcomes. However,
axonal outgrowth is only one component in the complex process of regenerating functional peripheral nerves,
which also involves recruitment and activity of multiple accessory cell-types, such as Schwann cells, immune
cells, and endothelial cells [2, 3]. In other published studies, we have demonstrated that FL2 can regulate motility
and migration of several cell types [4]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the mechanism by which FL2-
depletion promotes CN regeneration and improves erectile function outcomes following injury is multi-
faceted, involving accelerated migration of key cell types to the site of injury, in addition to enhancing
axonal growth. We will test this hypothesis using both in vitro and in vivo models and confirm that the
mechanisms of CN repair function in both young and older animals (more appropriate to the age at which men
undergo RP).
We will test our hypothesis through two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine if accelerated nerve
regeneration by FL2-depletion is associated with increased migration of Schwann cells, immune cells, and
endothelial cells to the site of CN injury and if aging affects the recruitment of these accessory cell-types. In Aim
2 we will determine the ability of targeted FL2-depletion to promote CN-regeneration, preserve penile
architecture and recover erectile function in rat models of RP.
Our research will lead to greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms by which FL2-depletion promotes
CN repair and recovery of erectile function after RP, and if aging affects these mechanisms. By understanding
these mechanisms, we will potentially identify novel therapeutic strategies not only to treat, but also to prevent,
ED following RP."

Heart failure (HF) due to ischemic heart diseases such as myocardial infarction (MI) remains a global health
crisis and new therapies to limit the progression to HF after MI are greatly needed. Patient outcomes after MI
largely depend on the magnitude, severity, and duration of tissue remodeling - a complex process that involves
acute and chronic changes in the structure, function, and cellular makeup of the heart in response to injury. In
particular, proper scar formation is required for adequate healing and maintenance of cardiac function. However,
the injured heart is predisposed to chronic inflammation and excess scarring, or fibrosis, which promotes cardiac
dysfunction, pathological remodeling, and propensity towards HF. It is well recognized that the inflammatory
response during post-MI remodeling is a critical determinant of whether scar formation proceeds in a beneficial
way to achieve tissue healing or progresses to chronic pathological fibrosis. Inflammation in the post-MI setting
is both beneficial and detrimental. For example, acute MI patients given broad-acting anti-inflammatory agents
are predisposed to wall rupture due to a muted fibrotic response, highlighting the critical role of inflammatory
cells in mediating acute healing through fibroblast activity. Prior work from the proposal PI as a postdoctoral
fellow uncovered an unexpected paradigm where activating a subset of innate immune cells, cardiac tissue-
resident macrophages (TRMs) expressing the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 (CX3), improved cardiac wound
healing and limited fibrosis after MI in a mouse model. This provided proof-of-concept evidence that certain
aspects of the inflammatory response can be selectively enhanced to keep post-MI remodeling in balance and
improve outcomes. However, the precise cellular signals that drive this pro-healing phenotype in macrophages
remain unclear, preventing the development of therapies that harness these beneficial effects of cardiac TRMs.
This proposal seeks to address this by elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby CX3+ TRMs
resolve chronic inflammation and pathological fibrosis in a mouse MI model. To achieve this, we will employ two
distinct genetic mouse models to inhibit CX3+ TRMs, genetic macrophage tracking, a well-defined surgical model
of MI, and cutting-edge multi-omics, biophysical, and molecular assays of cardiac fibrosis. In Specific Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that CX3 is required for cardiac TRMs to promote healing post-MI, through attenuating
fibroblast expansion and extracellular matrix remodeling. In Specific Aim 2, we leverage a comprehensive spatial
transcriptomics and proteomics approach to test the hypothesis that local cardiac microenvironment cues from
other subsets of inflammatory macrophages prevent resolution of fibrosis and tissue healing by CX3+ TRMs.
Overall our Proposal will determine how CX3+ TRMs act mechanistically to promote myocardial healing and
resolve chronic inflammation and fibrosis. These data will reveal potential therapeutic pathways to enhance
infarct repair by promoting CX3+ TRM functions. Our long-term goal is to contribute novel insights to better
understand and therapeutically modulate cardiac tissue remodeling, thus limiting the progression of HF."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive metabolic disease characterized by deficient insulin secretion from the
pancreatic b-cells, decreased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues (i.e., insulin resistance), and both fasting
and postprandial hyperglycemia. Although the phenotypes and negative outcomes surrounding T2D have been
extensively studied, the mechanisms by which lifestyle, nutrition, and genetic risk factors interact to trigger the
onset and early progression of T2D remain poorly understood. For example, although GWAS studies have
identified hundreds of loci that potentially play a role in T2D, interactions between putative genetic risk factors
and endocrine signaling, metabolic flux, and nutrient processing are difficult to study in vivo. Moreover, since
T2D involves metabolic dysfunction in multiple organ systems, including the pancreas, muscle, liver, heart,
intestine, white adipose tissue, kidneys, and brain, genetic studies must account for the cell- and tissue-
specific gene functions. Considering that >10% of the world population currently suffers from some form of
diabetes, with most of these individuals assumed to have T2D, there is a pressing global need to efficiently and
rapidly determine how genetic risk factors, gene-by-diet interactions, and disruptions of tissue-specific gene
function induce the onset and progression of T2D. We are addressing this need by using multi-omics to
conduct a genome-wide study of metabolic genes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, with the goal of
identifying metabolic enzymes and small molecule transporters that contribute to onset and progression of
T2D. We will use a three-prong approach to spearhead these studies. First, we will use a novel high-throughput
metabolomics method combined with the Drosophila TRiP RNAi collection to determine how individual
metabolic enzymes and transporters protect animal cells against excess sugar consumption. Our
metabolomics approach will be complemented with snRNAseq, facilitating the discovery of tissue- and cell-
specific mechanisms by which individual enzymes/transporters guard against the detrimental effects of a HSD.
Finally, we will curate a canonical set of Drosophila metabolic pathway diagrams within FlyBase, the official
Drosophila knowledgebase, which will inform and be informed by the experimental data in this proposal, and
provide an invaluable bioinformatic resource for broader research community. Once completed, our studies will
have generated one of the most comprehensive in vivo metabolic studies ever conducted in animals,
significantly advanced our understanding of how excess sugar consumption rewires the intermediary
metabolism of individual cell types, and identified novel metabolic mechanism by which excess sugar
consumption contributes to T2D and other metabolic diseases."

With an estimated annual cost of $12.5 billion in the United States, epilepsy affects approximately 3.4 million
Americans and carries a lifetime risk of around 3%. The most common form of epilepsy is focal in nature,
meaning seizures arise from a restricted part of the brain. It remains a significant challenge to predict who will
respond well to treatment despite modern technology and research, largely due to the heterogeneity of focal
epilepsy. Existing statistical methods to analyze seizure data do not appropriately address the within- and
between-individual variation in epileptic seizures over time.
We propose to leverage our access to the Human Epilepsy Project (HEP1 and HEP2), an observational study
of 450 patients with focal epilepsy that tracked seizures longitudinally, and our statistical and clinical expertise
to develop novel dynamic prediction models for seizure frequency over time. The daily seizure data from HEP
show (1) subgroups of individuals with different seizure trajectories and (2) clumping of seizures, in which a
patient is more likely to experience subsequent seizures following a seizure episode. Dynamic prediction
models have been used successfully in other clinical areas besides epilepsy, but they do not allow for
subgroups of trajectories. Similarly, clumping of events has been handled with the Hawkes process in
association models where a homogenous population is assumed. Instead, we seek to predict occurrence of
events and understand covariate effects on processes where subgroups of trajectories exist. We hypothesize
that accounting for subgroups of individual trajectories and clumping of seizures will provide more accurate
and precise prediction of seizure outcomes.
We plan to develop novel models for prediction of seizure events through the following aims: (i) Develop a
Bayesian nonparametric models for dynamic personalized prediction of seizures over time. We will use the
HEP1 dataset to predict longitudinal seizure count and occurrence that allows for subgroups of trajectories and
will evaluate the methods using HEP2 data, (ii) Develop a novel Dirichlet Process Mixture Hawkes process
model for personalized prediction of recurrent event data that will allow for subgroups and clumping of events;
and will compare to existing approaches to handle clumping, and (iii) Develop an R package and a shiny
application to implement and illustrate the novel methods. The expected outcomes of this work are both
clinically and statistically significant: a) a shiny application tool to obtain tailored predictions of longitudinal
seizure trajectory based on seizure history, treatment and other clinically relevant covariates that will help
patients and clinicians identify optimal treatment earlier in the personalized course of the patient’s disease; and
b) the new methods will be relevant to other epilepsy types and other conditions, for example in modeling
relapses in multiple sclerosis."

 Diarrhea kills more than half a million children each year and is the third largest contributor to lost disability
adjusted life years. While rehydration addresses the acute consequences of diarrhea, there are no interventions
for diarrhea convalescence during which children are at high risk of malnutrition, lower-respiratory tract
infections, and recurring diarrhea episodes. Safe and effective interventions to address the long-term
consequences of diarrheal disease are urgently needed.
Lactoferrin and lysozyme are milk-derived nutritional supplements that may reduce the duration of diarrheal
episodes, treat or prevent underlying enteric infections, improve enteric function, and accelerate nutritional
recovery. However, it remains unclear whether their antimicrobial action will translate into significant
improvements in the long-term clinical and nutritional outcomes of childhood diarrhea. We propose a factorial,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to determine the efficacy and mechanisms of lactoferrin and
lysozyme supplementation in minimizing the incidence of diarrhea and promoting nutritional recovery among
children recovering from diarrhea and wasting. Kenyan children aged 6-24 months who have been discharged
from an inpatient or outpatient hospital stay for diarrhea, and have a mid-upper arm circumference [MUAC] <12.5
cm will be randomized to 16-weeks of lactoferrin, lysozyme, a combination of the two, or placebo. This trial will
provide much efficacy, mechanistic, and feasibility data from populations most likely to benefit from these
interventions."
10909286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The detection and rapid avoidance of harmful external stimuli via pain perception is crucial for survival. The
sensors of pain pathways are nociceptors, specialized peripheral sensory neurons. Nociceptors detect external
extreme stimuli such as temperature, pressure and chemicals associated with injury via sensory ion channels
expressed on the plasma membrane. In response to such stimuli, they fire action potentials and convey the
information to the brain, thus alerting us to potential injury and allowing us to take proper actions. Transient
receptor potential melastatin 3 (TRPM3) is one of three molecular pain sensors that, together with TRPV1 and
TRPA1, detect noxious heat. TRPM3 is a calcium-permeable nonselective cation channel belonging to the
melastatin subfamily of the TRP superfamily. It is expressed in a large subset of somatosensory neurons and
is activated by heat and by a variety of chemical ligands, including the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone
sulfate (PS). Both heat and PS-induced activation of TRPM3 evoke pain. TRPM3-deficient mice show a deficit
in the development of inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia. Inhibition of TRPM3 by low doses of primidone in
PS- and heat-induced pain models showed analgesic effects in mice. The activity of TRPM3 in somatosensory
neurons is also negatively modulated by Gβγ protein which is released upon activation of several G-protein-
coupled receptors, thereby reducing TRPM3-mediated pain. Because pain is a major unresolved medical
problem and because pharmacotherapies targeting GPCR have many and severe unwanted effects,
pharmacological targeting of the downstream TRPM3 may have great potential to influence several signaling
pathways relevant in pain sensation and in the development of new and alternative analgesic drugs. TRPM3 is
also highly expressed in pancreatic beta cells and has application in glucose-induced insulin release.
Moreover, TRPM3 is implicated in developmental and epileptic encephalopathies which are a heterogeneous
group of disorders characterized by epilepsy with comorbid intellectual disability. At present, the physiological
and pathological properties of TRPM3 are still poorly understood. The focus of this proposal is to determine the
first TRPM3 structures in different functional states at high-resolution, and to understand the molecular
architecture, gating mechanism, and pharmacology of TRPM3 by combining single-particle cryo electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) and patch-clamp electrophysiology. We will also initiate the purification of TRPM3 from
native tissues using monoclonal antibodies that recognize three-dimensional epitopes of TRPM3 as well as
knocked-in affinity tag to TRPM3 gene in mice as there is growing evidence that proteins purified from native
sources may display different assembly, complex composition, and functional properties relative to proteins
from recombinant systems. The strong preliminary data we provide will ensure the success of this proposal,
and the outcome of this proposal will pave a solid foundation for the development of novel analgesics."

 Yersinia pestis causes the acute human disease commonly referred to as plague. A hallmark manifestation of
this disease is delayed inflammation despite active bacterial replication. Y. pestis modulates inflammation by
actively inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via the action of a group of proteins called Yop
effectors that are directly injected into host cells by a bacterial type three secretion system (T3SS). Because
establishment of this non-inflammatory environment is key for Y. pestis to colonize the host, understanding how
Y. pestis modulates the host inflammatory response during early stages of infection will provide crucial insights
into both the pathogenesis of the bacterium and potential strategies to improve therapy. Lipid mediators, such
as members of the eicosanoid family, are essential to initiate the cascade of signaling events that regulates
inflammation. Therefore, disruption of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids can effectively stifle a rapid
immune response. Despite their importance in initiating inflammation, the role of lipid mediators in the context of
plague has not been previously investigated. Recently, we discovered a dysregulation in eicosanoid synthesis
during pneumonic plague, highlighted by the inhibition in the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory lipid leukotriene
B4 (LTB4). Furthermore, using Y. pestis mutants we uncovered a novel mechanism for the recognition of the
T3SS by neutrophils that triggers LTB4 synthesis, which is normally inhibited by the Yop effectors. Together,
these discoveries support a conceptually innovative hypothesis that Y. pestis actively manipulates the synthesis
of lipid mediators to disrupt the proper inflammatory cascade that would normally recruit circulating leukocytes
to control infection. In Aim 1, we will test this hypothesis using animal models to define the contribution of
eicosanoids to the host response during plague and determine how disruption of LTB4 synthesis benefits Y.
pestis. In Aim 2, we will use Y. pestis as a tool to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for T3SS-
dependent LTB4 synthesis by neutrophils. Because lipid mediators of inflammation have been overlooked in the
context of Y. pestis immune evasion, completion of these studies will significantly transform our conceptual
understanding of the early immune events during pneumonic plague."
11093665,"PROJECT SUMMARY. COPD is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide and is attributable to the
aggregate burden of toxic gases and particles that individuals inhale during their lifetime. In the US, this exposure
is primarily cigarette smoke; however, even after smoking cessation, patients with COPD continue to suffer
respiratory morbidity. International 2022 COPD guidelines (GOLD) emphasize non-pharmacological
interventions to improve health, but few evidence-based interventions exist. The indoor environment is of
particular concern, as adults with COPD spend >90% of their time in the home. Particulate matter (PM) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are common pollutants in indoor environments and lead to worse respiratory morbidity.
Our own study found that former smokers with COPD who have higher exposure to indoor pollutants have worse
respiratory-specific quality of life, symptoms, and a higher risk of respiratory exacerbations. Our group recently
completed a randomized controlled trial of 116 former smokers with COPD in Baltimore, MD (PI Hansel),
demonstrating that the placement of two portable air cleaners with high efficiency particulate air and carbon
filters can significantly reduce in-home PM and NO2 concentrations. In intention-to-treat analysis, there was a
trend toward better respiratory-specific quality of life, as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire
(SGRQ) and statistically significant lower risk for moderate exacerbation, but not severe exacerbations, among
those who received the active air cleaner compared to sham. Further, per-protocol analysis suggested a dose-
response; among those who used the air cleaner at least 80% of the time, with a statistically significant
improvement in SGRQ. Despite encouraging results, the study did not meet its primary endpoint and was not
powered to determine whether air cleaner interventions can reduce moderate/severe exacerbations, including
acute health care utilization. Furthermore, the trial did not include strategies to increase adherence; and results
are limited to a small geographic area, limiting generalizability. The proposed study is a Phase III multi-center
randomized sham-controlled environmental trial to test the effectiveness of an air cleaner intervention targeting
indoor pollutants (PM and NO2) on quality of life and exacerbation risk reduction among former smokers with
COPD (n~770) across multiple clinical practice locations. We will conduct cost-effectiveness analysis to ensure
that study results address both clinical and economic efficacy to support policy decisions. We hypothesize that
the placement of two portable air cleaners with high efficiency particulate air and carbon filters can lead to
improved quality of life, reduced COPD exacerbation risk and reduced need for rescue medication use. Lastly,
we hypothesize that the use of portable air cleaners is cost-effective. The trial will provide a novel approach to
improve quality of life in these patients with significant morbidity; and for the prevention of COPD exacerbations,
which drive the morbidity and mortality of this chronic disabling disease. In addition to addressing clinical efficacy,
the study results will provide an economic evaluation to support policy decisions regarding reimbursement."

 The primary goal of this training proposal is to understand how dynorphinergic regulation of circuits in the
dorsomedial striatum (DMS) enhances seeking behaviors for natural (sucrose) and drug (fentanyl) rewards.
Enhanced dynorphin-kappa opioid receptor (dyn-KOR) signaling and aberrant striatal activity is associated with
the transition from recreational to persistent opioid-seeking. Yet how dyn neuron activity and subsequent -KOR
modulation of the striatum regulates sucrose or fentanyl-seeking is unknown. During the first phase of my
postdoctoral research, using a combination of pharmacology, genetics, in vivo photometry and optogenetics, I
identified that retrograde dyn transmission at BLA inputs to the DMS enhances BLA-DMS activity, and promotes
natural reward-seeking behaviors. However, when exactly dyn neuron activity and release are engaged in
reward-seeking is unknown. Hence, I will obtain training in, and use in vivo two-photon imaging to understand
how DMS dyn ensembles encode reward-seeking for sucrose, (Aim 1A, K99). I will also extensively characterize
and use a novel dyn biosensor using in vivo photometry to determine if the pattern of ensemble activity is
reflected in subsequent DMS dyn release, (Aim 1B, K99). Furthermore, because aberrant dyn-KOR signaling is
linked to maladaptive opioid-seeking, and my preliminary data suggests a role for dyn-KOR activity to enhance
sucrose-seeking, I will develop and use an oral fentanyl self-administration paradigm in conjunction with in vivo
photometry to dissect when BLA-DMS terminals are engaged during fentanyl-seeking (Aim 2A, K99). I will also
multiplex conditional deletions of dyn in the DMS, or KOR in the BLA, and stimulate dyn release in the DMS,
with in vivo photometry during fentanyl-seeking to determine whether enhanced dyn-KOR signaling negatively
modulates fentanyl-seeking (Aim 2B, K99). For the R00 “independent” phase of my proposal, I propose to extend
the findings from Aims 1 and 2 in my own lab. I will delineate how DMS dyn ensemble activity encodes fentanyl-
seeking, manipulate specific ensembles to control behavior via spatial light modulation, and dissect the necessity
for BLA inputs in the DMS to induce dyn release during fentanyl-seeking (Aim 3, R00). The proposed studies
specifically address how elevated endogenous dynorphin-KOR signaling, via its control of activity in the
DMS, regulates natural and fentanyl reward-seeking. During the proposed K99 training period, I will be trained
in in vivo two-photon calcium imaging approaches, opioid biosensor imaging and oral self-administration.
Additionally, I will actively participate in scientific society conferences, obtain career development training
(budgeting and administrative tasks), and continue to further my scholarly knowledge base (planned interactions
with my mentor and committee members). Altogether, this award will greatly facilitate the development of my
own research program, thereby preparing me for an independent neuroscience career as a principal investigator."

With increasing age comes age-associated declines in cognitive and everyday functioning, a greater
propensity for illness, and the onset of disorders such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s
Disease Related Dementias (ADRD). People with MCI are at a high risk for developing dementia and thus
interventions are needed to improve or maintain current levels of function or delay further cognitive decline, as
well as to improve the quality of life among those with MCI. VR-based approaches are portable, adaptable, and
cost-effective, which offers enhanced access compared to outpatient treatments. In addition to demonstrating
efficacy, another crucial goal of intervention research is developing an understanding of “how and why”
interventions work. Insufficient understanding of the underlying principles or the mechanisms of action of
interventions impedes implementation. As such, the goal of the proposed work is to generate and test a VR-
based intervention to improve the wellbeing and quality of life of older adults with MCI while simultaneously
untangling the intervention’s hypothesized mechanisms of action and moderators of intervention success. This
project is highly innovative as it is using a VR-based delivery method and harnesses the human capital of older
individuals seeking volunteer experiences to engage in meaningful social and cognitive engagement with other
older adults with MCI as intervention partners. The inclusion of volunteers will also provide meaningful
experiences for the volunteers and enhance the scalability of the intervention. The activities of this Stage I
behavioral intervention project will include the generation of a new VR intervention (through the refinement of
VR modules that we have already developed along with the creation of new modules), the development of
instructional materials to train community interventionists (older adult volunteers), and the preliminary testing of
intervention efficacy. The intervention development will apply a user-centered iterative design approach to
generate and evaluate the Social Engaging Restorative Virtual Environment (SERVE), which will provide older
adults with MCI an opportunity for social interaction through a variety of social and cognitively engaging
collaborative activities within their own homes. The intervention will pair MCI individuals with non-impaired
older adult volunteers. MCI participants and volunteers will interact remotely within a shared virtual space and
productively engage and collaborate in shared activities. We hypothesize, based on empirical research and
theoretical models of aging, that SERVE will increase perceived social support among the older adult
participants with MCI, and that increases in perceived social support will reduce loneliness, improve wellbeing,
and enhance quality of life. Our pilot data and a growing body of research literature suggest that perceived
spatial presence within the VR environment will be an important moderator of intervention success."

 Emotion-regulatory deficits are a hallmark of mood and anxiety disorders, which afflict over 20% of
adults in the United States. Poor emotion regulation is often characterized by the context-inappropriate
expression of emotion, including the unwarranted persistence and influence of negative states outside their
temporal context. Therefore, the ability to respond to emotional events in a temporally and contextually
sensitive manner is paramount to mental health and wellbeing. Evidence from cognitive control studies
indicates that function of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), including lateral frontal pole and mid-LPFC, is
essential for temporally organized cognitive control and behavior sensitive to goals and context. However,
mechanistic studies of LPFC function in emotion are lacking, even though there are strong indications of a
prominent but little-understood role for LPFC in promoting adaptive emotional functioning, including
hypoactivation and reduced LPFC connectivity in mood and anxiety disorders, associations between LPFC
lesions and incidence of major depression, and the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to LPFC to
treat depression. The central goal of this proposal is therefore to elucidate the organization, representational
and causal contributions of distinct LPFC regions for adaptive time and context sensitive emotional responding.
 This proposal tests the central hypothesis that the human lateral frontal pole (FPl) integrates emotional
and temporal information to promote goal-oriented and context-sensitive responses via downstream mid-LPFC
function. This hypothesis is informed by documented neuroanatomical projections, insights into the
organization of temporal control in LPFC, and recent work unveiling functional specificity in distinct LPFC
regions during emotion-dependent cognitive control.
 Using an innovative combination of multivariate analysis of fMRI data and information-guided TMS, the
proposed studies examine the representational and causal roles of distinct LPFC regions for (1) goal-oriented
action that requires accurate tracking of temporally extended emotional information (Aim 1) and (2) temporal-
context sensitive regulation of affect (Aim 2). Full-factorial representational similarity analysis will permit
quantifying emotional valence, temporal, and contextual goal signals—as well as, critically, their interaction.
Information-guided TMS, followed by task fMRI acquisition, will establish functional and representational
specificity of distinct LPFC regions—FPl and mid-LPFC—with causal inference (Aims 1b-2b). Task-based
functional connectivity analysis will uncover the topology of amygdala-LPFC interactions (including
intermediary mPFC nodes) associated with emotion-temporal integration and affect regulation (Aim 3).
Collectively, these Aims will advance a directional model of how LPFC function and amygdala-LPFC
interactions support adaptive time-and-context appropriate responses in the face of emotional challenges."
10913570,"Genome sequencing is becoming cheaper and more powerful. However, a bottleneck to
scientific progress using these data is the generation of high-quality genome
annotations, describing the location and function of the genes in genomic DNA. In the
past, these annotations were generated exclusively by professional biocurators, and
these biocurators continue to be a critical source of expertise. However, the number of
such biocurators is small compared to the amount of genomic DNA that is available. In
recent years, professional biocuration has been supplemented by a growing volunteer
force of interested biologists, each generally interested in one or two genes of interest.
Although genome annotation is often done in bulk using computational tools, there is
currently no substitute for a final pass of manual annotation. This is most commonly
done using our Apollo software, which allows for live simultaneous collaborative
annotation over the web. Our proposal here is to improve Apollo so as to empower both
professional biocurators and crowdsourcing volunteers. We will empower professional
biocurators by giving them the power tools they need to simultaneously annotate
multiple genomes (by exploiting synteny), annotate variants, and annotate the function
of genes. We will empower the crowdsourcing volunteers by lowering barriers to entry,
making Apollo more usable. For all users we will train machine learning systems to
automatically detect common annotation errors and suggest improvements. We will
support Apollo users with maintenance, bugfixing, and various feature requests, as well
as extensive outreach including outreach to developers."

Metabolic perturbations underpin a wide variety of cardiomyopathies. Currently, there are no specific treatments
for preventing the onset or progression of cardiomyopathies to heart failure, one of the leading causes of death
and disability worldwide. BSCL2/Seipin is a highly conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein widely
implicated in lipid droplet biogenesis and triglyceride (TG) metabolism. However, the molecular machinery
responsible for BSCL2-regulated cardiac lipid metabolism has not been elucidated. This grant addresses novel
linkages between BSCL2, TG lipolysis, and mitochondrial function in the heart. We found that cardiac BSCL2
deletion elevates adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) expression and fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and causes TG
reduction and mild cardiac dysfunction with age. However, BSCL2 deletion completely rescues lethal metabolic
cardiomyopathy in ATGL-deficient mice. This was achieved by restoring cardiac TG lipolysis and FA oxidation,
suggesting the presence of other non-ATGL TG lipase (s)/players downstream of BSCL2. We further employed
Bscl2 knock-in mouse and proteomics and showed that BSCL2 interacts with mitochondrial protein and co-
fractionates with proteins present in ER membranes associated with mitochondria (MAM). We, therefore,
hypothesize that BSCL2 mediates ATGL-independent TG catabolism, ER-mitochondria coupling, and
mitochondrial function thus cardiac homeostasis and lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. Aim 1 will elucidate the
importance and mechanisms of a novel TG lipase in the heart that controls cardiac triglyceride hydrolysis and
FA oxidation downstream of BSCL2. Aim 2 will define whether BSCL2 interacts with a specific mitochondrial
protein at ER/mitochondria contact sites to mediate mitochondrial function and lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. This
study is highly significant as it defines the novel components and molecular machinery of BSCL2-mediated
ATGL-independent pathways that regulate cardiac TG metabolism, MAM, mitochondrial metabolism, and heart
function, which can potentially lay an intellectual groundwork for novel therapeutic approaches to metabolic
cardiomyopathy."

This proposal aims to engineer a multifactorial wound dressing composed of open porous nanofibrous
microspheres (NMs) integrated with a stimuli-responsive fibrillar hydrogel (FHG) to release therapeutics to
accelerate diabetic wound healing. The open porous structure in the proposed wound dressing can enhance cell
migration and granulation tissue formation for rapid wound closure. Initially, the porous NMs will be fabricated
from electrospun short nanofiber segments using our newly invented core-shell electrospray technique with
bubble technology. Afterward, the peptide-tethered matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) responsive FHG will be
integrated with porous NMs to develop an injectable hybrid gel followed by photocrosslinking. Previously, we
demonstrated that porous nanofiber scaffolds show tremendous improvements in cell migration and cell/tissue
integration. Inspired by the results, we will develop a new wound dressing platform that improves the wound
healing process in several aspects; (i) The extracellular matrix (ECM) mimetic porous structure of the NMs can
accelerate the cell migration during the healing. (ii) Engineering an ECM mimetic FHG with methacrylate gelatin
(GelMA) and MMP responsive peptide linker can offer to maintain the moist conditions and sustained delivery of
therapeutic agents locally. (iii) The engineered peptide conjugated NMs integrated FHG can prevent diabetic
wound infection and tune the angiogenesis by sustained release of antibacterial and angiogenic peptides. To
achieve these goals, we will incorporate antibacterial LL-37 mimic W379 peptide, and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) mimetic QK peptide to the NMs integrated FHG. Specifically, we have identified that porous
NMs properties can modulate cell migration through the porous microarchitecture and improve wound healing
compared with nonporous NMs composed gel. The fibrillar hydrogel network will provide moist conditions in the
wound similar to ECM and the controlled release of peptides in the wound milieu. We will evaluate and optimize
material properties using the following characterization workflow: the porosity of NMs, the injectability of hybrid
gel, in vitro cytotoxicity quantification, in vitro gel degradation with different MMP cell responses (survival,
proliferation, and migration), in vitro antibacterial efficacy of W379 peptide, in vitro angiogenic properties of QK
peptide, in vivo immune response (analysis by Flow cytometry), in vivo material degradation (analysis by
histology), and in vivo tissue healing/regeneration (analysis by immunohistology). Afterward,
we will focus on an
infected diabetic mouse (db/db) splinted wound healing model to evaluate the efficacy of the dressing with and
without peptides
. We expect to see accelerated wound healing through the open porous NMs composed of the
injectable hydrogel compared with commercially available Geistlich Derma gideTM composed of the injectable
hydrogel. This project has the potential to develop a new class of biomaterial and create an inexpensive and
effective treatment for diabetic wounds by increasing our understanding of how to inhibit biofilm formation and
porosity-induced cell migration in diabetic wound closure."

The development of new therapies in heart failure is a critical need and current drug development in this field is
not sufficient to keep pace with the increasing incidence and mortality of this disease. Novel therapeutic targets
are required as are model systems that more closely resemble human cardiac physiology. Protein kinase A
(PKA) is a cAMP sensitive kinase that is the central relay for beta-adrenergic stimulation of cardiomyocyte
contraction and calcium flux. With a broad set of substrates, specificity of signaling relies on careful regulation
of both cAMP metabolism and kinase activity. Regulatory subunits of PKA both inhibit kinase activity and help
recruit effectors and macromolecular binding partners to orchestrate kinase signaling. Type I regulatory subunits
are broadly expressed yet how their function is modulated is not well known. In recently published work, we
demonstrate that the Type Iα regulatory subunit (PRKAR1A) is phosphorylated by the kinase STK25. In studies
performed in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM), phosphorylation of
PRKAR1A led to inhibition of PKA kinase activity and downstream signaling in response to cAMP through
increased binding to the catalytic subunit. Knockout studies of Stk25 in mice confirmed its in vivo role of inhibiting
PKA activity. In further preliminary data, the Stk25 knockout was associated with improved outcomes after
myocardial infarction with decreased fibrosis and increased cardiac function. In a set of logical and feasible
aims, we propose to tests the hypothesis that STK25 phosphorylation of PRKAR1A leads to inhibition of PKA
activity and that this signaling between STK25 and PRKAR1A has therapeutic potential. In Aim 1, we use
genetically modified iPSC-CM’s to investigate the mechanism of how phosphorylation leads to increased
inhibition of PKA activity as well as characterize the changes to the macromolecular PKA complex in response
to phosphorylation of PRKAR1A. In Aim 2, transgenic mice with knock-in mutations are utilized to investigate
Prkar1a phosphorylation and its regulation of PKA activity in vivo. In the third aim, an inducible conditional
knockout of Stk25 is generated in mice and is used to explore the mechanism underlying the improvement after
myocardial infarction in response to loss of Stk25. We will examine if loss of Stk25 after a myocardial infarction
imparts any benefit and whether a decrease in Prkar1a phosphorylation mediates this improvement. We also
will investigate a novel inhibitor to explore the pharmacologic potential of targeting this pathway after myocardial
infarction in vivo. We believe that this proposal will have significant impact on our understanding of PKA
regulation in cardiomyocytes and establish the phosphorylation of PRKAR1A as a as a potential therapeutic
modality in myocardial infarction and heart failure."

Microplastics (MPs) are a ubiquitous pollutant in natural waters and in foods and drinks derived from them. Not surprisingly,
MPs are ingested and inhaled by humans and found in human tissues. Research on MPs is made difficult by the labor
intensive protocols associated with isolating MPs from environmental and biological tissues, particularly at the size scales
most relevant to human health (< 20 µm). Researchers also need access to trusted reference MPs that mimic those found in
the environment. This Materials and Metrology Core (MMC) will serve as a resource that addresses these bottlenecks to
increase the efficiency and reproducibility of research in Center laboratories. The specific functions of the MMC are
organized into three Aims. Aim 1 will provide key research materials to the Center. These include laboratory-made mimetics
of environmental MPs for use as reference and control materials. As one novel resource, the MMC will work with Project
1 to adopt protocols generating MPs reflecting the types and aging of MPs found in Lake Ontairo. Another unique resource
of the MMC will be an inventory of silicon nanomembranes with various pore sizes. These inorganic membranes feature
precision patterned pores in size ranges < 20 µm and high permeability. The properties of silicon nanomembranes enable
the development of novel time-saving protocols for MP isolation, detection, and analysis. In these methods, raw samples
are added to nanomembranes housed in filtration devices and serially processed in situ until they are ready for imaging or
spectroscopic analysis. The elimination of manual transfers saves time while minimizing the risk of loss and contamination.
In Aim 2 the MMC will work with member laboratories to develop consensus protocols that are demonstrably reproducible
and rigorous and will share these through web resources. In Aim 3 the MMC will facilitate access to the growing number of
high-end tools and facilities in the Rochester area for MP research such as Raman instruments, electron microscopes, and
cyromilling instruments. The MMC will also play a role in the public distrubtion of the products emerging from the Center,
including consensus protocols, through the creation of a dedicated microplastics subsection of nanomembranes.org."
10769897,"The capacity to carry out somatic motor functions progressively diminishes with advancing age, having a significant effect on the overall health of individuals. Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying age-dependent motor deficits, as this information is necessary to develop treatments that preserve and restore motor function in old age. α-motor neurons are the effector cells of the motor system and are essential to all voluntary movement. The complex circuits created by their synapses in the spinal cord integrate motor commands and sensory feedback, and thereby make vital contributions to the proper execution of complex movements such as maintaining balance, coordination, and fine motor control. Unfortunately, the ability to perform these motor functions diminishes with advancing age in humans, suggesting that the underlying system undergoes deleterious changes. In this regard, the candidate recently discovered that the number of glutamatergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic synaptic inputs onto the somata of α-motor neurons is significantly decreased in aged mice. Meanwhile, glycinergic inputs appear to be unchanged, as do the number and size of α-motor neuron somata. These findings suggest significant changes to the functional capacity of the motor neurocircuitry and require that the full extent of these synaptic alterations be elucidated. Further, it must be determined whether α-motor neurons and spinal cord-resident glia undergo intrinsic changes that mitigate or exacerbate these alterations during aging. These gaps in knowledge have led to the following research questions: 1) Do the dendritic arbors of α-motor neurons and the synapses they create degenerate with advancing age? 2) Do α-motor neurons undergo intrinsic age-related changes to their biophysical properties? 3) What role do glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, play in the loss of motor synapses in the spinal cord? The candidate will answer each of these questions using various cellular, molecular, biochemical, and imaging assays during both the predoctoral and postdoctoral phases of this fellowship. Further, the candidate will take part in numerous professional development activities, including attendance at conferences, participation in internal and external training programs, and mentorship of junior trainees in the lab and in the classroom. Brown University is an ideal setting for the predoctoral phase of this fellowship. With the help of the sponsor, the candidate will identify a postdoctoral mentor at an institution of equal standing. In sum, the candidate has herein outlined a detailed plan to further his education and training as an aging researcher, while contributing significantly to our knowledge of the aging motor system."

10910172,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Diversity improves the ability to conduct research in all fields, but is especially crucial
for biomedical research, essential to our efforts to improve the health of the nation. Despite decades of sustained
effort, fewer than 2 percent of NIH primary investigators are Black, lower than the percentage of Black faculty at
medical schools and much lower than the general population. The same holds true for Hispanics and other
underrepresented groups (URGs). New, inventive solutions are thus urgently needed to promote the
advancement of biomedical URGs trainees. Here we propose individualized professional coaching as a scalable
and effective intervention. Coaching is a practice where a professionally trained coach helps the coachee clarify
aspirations, increase self-awareness, establish plans, take action to achieve goals, and overcome challenges.
Coaching research in a number of different academic settings has demonstrated improved self-efficacy and
mental health, which are needed for sustained academic success. However, professional coaching has never
been rigorously tested as an intervention for biomedical Ph.D. students, which is a significant gap in knowledge.
Using hypothesis-driven research, we will test the following hypothesis: Biomedical Ph.D. students who receive
individualized academic coaching will experience improved short-term outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, resilience,
reduced anxiety and depression) and sustained positive effects (degree persistence, goal attainment, ease in
career transitions, and tangible scholarly outputs) compared to their controls. An interdisciplinary team at Rutgers
with deep expertise in biomedical Ph.D. education and training, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), professional
coaching, mental health, biostatistics, and rigorous mixed-methods educational research will test this hypothesis
in the following three aims. For reproducibility, all experiments will be conducted at two institutions: Rutgers-New
Brunswick (R-NB) and Rutgers-Newark (R-N). The experiments will be an academic year (AY)-long and utilize
International Coaching Federation (ICF)-accredited coaches. URG and well-represented (WR) students will be
randomly assigned to either control (no coaching) or experimental groups (coaching). In Aim 1, validated
instruments will statistically measure short- and medium-term effects of professional coaching on goal
attainment, self-efficacy and mental health (anxiety, depression, resilience). As a complementary approach,
mixed methods will determine what gains occur, how they occur, and for what student populations they are most
pronounced. Our hypothesis will be first tested at R-NB and then at R-N. In Aim 2, the coaching elements that
lead to success will be defined including: i) dosage (frequency, duration) and ii) efficacy of Rutgers faculty/staff
trained as ICF coaches. In Aim 3, long-term effects will be measured (e.g., time to degree, career transition, self-
efficacy, and resilience). The proposed innovative research will have high impact by not only testing for the first
time whether coaching is an efficacious and scalable intervention, but by also identifying the key elements
needed for its implementation across institutions to address ongoing URG disparities in the workforce."

Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection is often asymptomatic or may produce recurrent lesions in and
around the mouth, commonly called “cold sores.” Ocular herpetic disease, typically caused by HSV-1 either
through primary infection or reactivation from the trigeminal ganglia (TG), can have serious sequelae, including
permanent corneal scarring and blindness. Herpes stromal keratitis (HSK) is one of the most common causes
of infectious blindness in the developed world, and worldwide produces over 40,000 new cases of severe
vision impairment or blindness each year. Interestingly, the majority of HSK tissue damage is thought to be
immune-mediated rather than resulting from direct lytic effects of the virus. Even after the virus has
successfully been cleared, high levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, immune cell infiltrates, and
neovascularization persist. How HSV-1 infection of the eye leads to this chronic inflammatory syndrome is not
well understood. By studying cellular factors that influence the host immune response, we will delineate the
cascade of events that begin with a viral infection and end with chronic inflammation and vision loss. This
proposal represents a continuation of our studies examining cellular factors that are important for HSK using a
murine model. The studies proposed here will address the immunomodulatory functions of PILRA and HVEM
in Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Keratitis. By investigating how PILRA and HVEM contributes to HSK, we will
better understand the viral-host interactions inflammatory syndrome that persists in the absence of replicating
virus, providing a basis for therapeutic interventions for HSK."

The long-term goal of my laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate auditory perception, and how
defects in hair cells and auditory neurons cause disease. We propose here to study the mechanisms that regulate
the differentiation, connectivity and function of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Our central hypothesis is that
SGNs are a diverse group of neurons with different connectivity patterns and functions, and that diversification
of SGNs and their connectivity depends on signals provided by hair cells. To test our hypothesis, we will combine
studies in genetically modified mice with histology, imaging, genomics, electrophysiological and hearing tests to
study SGN connectivity and function. We will map SGN projection patterns, define how mutations linked to
deafness affect SGN differentiation and projection patterns, and use genetic manipulations combined with
electrophysiology and genomic tools to identify signals initiated by hair cells that affect SGN differentiation. Our
preliminary data show the feasibility of our approach, demonstrating that SGNs are a molecularly diverse group
of neurons with different projection patterns and that defect in hair cells affect SGN differentiation. We anticipate
that our findings will define mechanisms by which hair cells affect SGNs to regulate their diversification into
subtypes with different functions and connectivity patterns."

grounded in the principle that the major proportion of the variability in health outcomes is environmentally
driven. This program will be led by environmental health physician-scientists and leverages Mount Sinai's
longstanding commitment to CEH, our Region 2 PEHSU, our NY state children's environmental health centers,
our established pipeline programs and regional networks to identify potential scholars, our infrastructure in

10732767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cytoskeletal proteins are fundamental in many biological processes among all eukaryotes. Given their
essentiality, they are conventionally thought to be highly conserved. However, signatures of genetic innovation
in the form of gene-family expansions and accelerated amino-acid substitutions are found among key
cytoskeletal family members. Rapid molecular divergence between closely related species is unexpected in
conserved protein families and is indicative of an adaptive advantage for sequence innovation. This proposal
will investigate the causes and consequences of this dramatic diversification of cytoskeletal proteins. Actin-
related proteins (Arps) are one cytoskeletal family that has ancient evolutionary origins yet exhibits recurrent
genetic innovation in both mammals and insects. Unlike the well-conserved members of the Arp superfamily,
divergent Arps are testis-specific in expression, suggesting they have acquired specialized roles for male
reproduction. Yet the biological process that drives their innovation is unknown. The localization of gametic
Arps in Drosophila suggests they play roles at germline-specific actin structures. This proposal will address the
hypothesis that gametic Arps facilitate the generation of actin structures that are critical for male reproductive
fitness. Aim 1 will uncover the function of one gametic Arp found in all Drosophila species, Arp53D, which
localizes to two germline actin structures during late spermatogenesis. D. melanogaster, which has many well-
established genetic tools and only one gametic Arp, provides an advantageous system in which to investigate
the function of a divergent Arp at actin and probe how its structural diversification allows for novel roles. Aim 2
will extend the analysis to mammalian gametic Arps to gain a deeper understanding of the potentially shared
biological processes that are driving Arp innovation among multiple phyla. A few pieces of evidence suggest
that mammalian gametic Arps play actin regulatory roles, much like Arp53D. Aim 2 will take a comprehensive
approach to elucidate their evolutionary histories and localization with respect to actin, while characterizing the
male infertility phenotype of one Arp with an established mouse knockout model. Finally, preliminary findings
suggest additional cases of rapidly evolving cytoskeletal proteins, beyond Arps, are present in the male
germline. Aim 3 will systematically search Drosophila and mammalian genomes for rapid evolution and gene
duplications among cytoskeletal proteins that are testis-enriched in expression. This aim will yield additional
cases of genetic innovation that will serve as projects in the applicant’s future lab to broadly understand the
adaptive sequence plasticity of cytoskeletal proteins and what drives their specialization for male reproduction.
To launch this project, the applicant requires training in fertility assays, mouse testis histology and additional
evolutionary analyses. She will ultimately use her background in biochemistry to study diversifying cytoskeletal
proteins at a mechanistic level."
10731750,"Project Summary and Abstract
Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases including myocardial
infarction, strokes, and heart failure leading to tremendous morbidity and mortality worldwide. Risk factor
modification such as reductions in hyperlipidemia and hypertension constitute the only treatments available for
this vexing disease. Thus, there is an active effort to identify the culprit cellular processes that provide
mechanistic insight. Various lines of evidence demonstrate a progressive dysfunction in the autophagy-
lysosome system of plaque macrophages, leading to an inability to degrade excess lipids and cytotoxic
materials accumulating in the atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, attempts at reprogramming the degradative
capacity of macrophages might be a fruitful therapeutic area. Our work with TFEB, the predominant
transcription factor regulating autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis, shows that enhancing this pathway in
macrophages leads to reductions in atherosclerosis of mice. We have also uncovered a regulatory mechanism
involving two key nutrients (amino acids and cholesterol) and mTORC1 which potently suppresses TFEB and
the autophagy-lysosome system in macrophages. This raises the prospect that targeting nutrient-mediated
mTORC1 activation can be a novel therapeutic strategy. In specific aim 1, we will evaluate the utility of
targeting amino acid-mTORC1-autophagy/lysosomal signaling in atherosclerosis. In specific aim 2, we will
focus on the cholesterol-mTORC1-autophagy/lysosomal signaling pathway as a potential atheroprotective
measure. Finally, we have learned that many autophagy-lysosome genes which are TFEB targets are
prominently upregulated in macrophages of regressing atherosclerotic plaques. In specific aim 3, we will use
our TFEB overexpressing mouse model to determine if harnessing the autophagy-lysosome system can also
be leveraged to promote atheroregression. Overall, this proposal will test the hypothesis that targeting the
macrophage mTORC1-autophagy/lysosomal pathway is a novel approach to treat atherosclerosis."
10843931,"Project Summary/Abstract- “Survivor” neurons drive persistent inflammation following West Nile
virus infection
 West Nile virus (WNV) is mosquito-borne flavivirus that can infect neurons of the central nervous
system. Both human patients murine model organisms that survive neuroinvasive WNV display learning,
memory and motor sequelae that persist long after the virus is cleared. While these sequelae have been
associated with persistent inflammation within the CNS, the source of this inflammation has remained
obscure. Previous studies by our group and others have revealed that neurons are remarkably resistant to
programmed cell death in response to multiple stressors, including viral infection. This observation led us to
hypothesize that neurons that are infected with WNV but survive and clear infection—“survivor” neurons—
sustain virus-induced changes that drive long-term inflammation and CNS disfunction. We sought to test
this idea by creating a recombinant clone of WNV that expresses Cre recombinase, then using this virus to
mark “survivor” neurons in the brains of WNV-infected mice. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of these cells
revealed that “survivor” neurons maintain a robust inflammatory signature weeks after viral infection is
cleared. Strikingly, this signature is absent in adjacent, WNV-naïve neurons within the same tissues,
supporting the idea that “survivor” neurons are drivers of persistent CNS inflammation. The goal of the work
proposed here is to use this newly-developed model to first understand the changes to “survivor” neurons
that drive persistent inflammation, and second to assess the consequences of this inflammatory response
on the function of these neurons, on nearby cells and on organismal learning and memory. We suggest that
the use of these new models and emerging technologies will provide important insight into CNS disfunction
caused by WNV infection. We further suggest that this insight may be applicable to long-term virus-induced
inflammatory dysfunction in other settings."
10843916,"The primary goal of this proposal is to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of photodynamic therapy in the
context of perforated appendicitis. This will be accomplished using in vivo rabbit models and in vitro evaluation
of human specimens. Appendicitis is the most common general surgical condition affecting children and
contributes to more morbidity and health care resource utilization than any other pediatric general surgical
condition. Approximately ⅓ of pediatric cases in the United States present with perforated appendicitis (PA),
with these perforated cases associated with higher costs, longer hospitalizations, higher hospital readmission
rates, and worse postoperative outcomes. Prolonged antibiotic therapy after appendectomy remains the
mainstay for treatment for intra-abdominal infection. This results in long hospital stays and may not be
effective against antibiotic resistant strains, highlighting the need for alternative therapies.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which exerts antimicrobial activity through photochemical generation of reactive
oxygen species, is broad spectrum and fast acting, efficacious against antibiotic-resistant strains, and does not
result in acquired resistance. Given that the intra-abdominal infection associated with PA is polymicrobial and
often complicated by bacterial resistance to common antibiotics, PDT is an appealing adjunct to the
treatment of intra-abdominal infection in perforated appendicitis and could further be used to treat
abscess formation post-appendectomy.
The objective of this study is to demonstrate proof-of-concept of antimicrobial PDT as a treatment of
intra-abdominal infection in perforated appendicitis in a rabbit model, as well as efficacy against
bacteria isolated from human samples. This high risk, high reward study could revolutionize management of
PA, and drastically reduce hospital stay and complications.
Aim 1 – Demonstrate feasibility and efficacy of photodynamic therapy in a rabbit model of perforated
appendicitis. Using an established rabbit model of PA, a prospective study will be performed to assess
reduction of bacterial burden in the peritoneal cavity following methylene blue photodynamic therapy (MB-
PDT). Bacterial load will be quantified pre- and post-PDT, and compared to control animals that receive
illumination without MB. It is hypothesized that MB-PDT will result in a reduction of ≥99.9% in total bacterial
population, with potential variation in killing of specific bacterial species found in the intestinal flora.
Aim 2 – Demonstrate efficacy of photodynamic therapy in vitro for bacteria isolated from patients with
perforated appendicitis. Bacteria isolated from aspirated peritoneal fluid captured from pediatric patients
undergoing appendectomy for PA will be characterized. MB-PDT will then be performed on both planktonic
cultures and biofilms. It is hypothesized that PDT will significantly reduce bacterial burden, with biofilms
potentially requiring larger drug/light doses for comparable efficacy."
10907021,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Decreased muscle and bone mass and strength resulting from musculoskeletal unloading (disuse
osteosarcopenia) has long been associated with increased fracture risk, impaired bone healing and worse
patient outcomes. Current disease modifying drugs are centered primarily on bone targeted therapies (anti-
resorptives and PTH), and remain ineffective at targeting muscle loss that appears crucial for healthy bone
repair and reducing fall risk. Although early reambulation and physical rehabilitation following bone injury is
known to be beneficial for fracture healing and muscle recovery, there remains a gap in our knowledge of the
appropriate mechanical loading regimens following osteosarcopenic fracture due to limited knowledge of how
disuse affects fracture healing mechanobiology. In preliminary work, we have a developed a murine model of
fracture healing during disuse by hindlimb unloading, with and without remobilization. This model recapitulates
many clinical features of bone repair during disuse (decreased skeletal muscle mass, decreased
radiographical callus formation) with new findings such as altered callus vascularity and osteoclastogenesis
that are attenuated with reambulation. The aims outlined in this proposal seek to greatly expand upon our
preliminary studies by using non-invasive loading modalities targeting muscle and or bone directly to determine
the critical cellular and molecular mediators of callus mechanobiology during disuse. In the mentored K99
portion of this grant, we will utilize non-invasive optogenetics and direct tibial loading to determine optimal
mechanical inputs to increase callus healing, biomechanical integrity, and muscle mass during disuse (Aim 1).
Next using high-throughput techniques (RNAseq and flow cytometry), we will investigate the potential
underlying mechanisms by which non-invasive loading affects callus mechanobiology during disuse (Aim 2).
During the R00 phase, Dr. Buettmann will leverage recent mechanistic findings to determine the conditional
role of mechanosensitive molecules in coordinating load-induced alterations in fracture healing during disuse
(Aim 3). These insights will help bridge a significant gap in our understanding of how disuse alters callus
mechanobiology and how mechanically-regulated molecules can be leveraged to improve fracture healing and
rehabilitation in osteosarcopenic “high risk” patients. These findings, owing to the preclinical model’s
translatability, could also have far-reaching implications for other pathologies associated with impaired fracture
healing and altered mechanosensation such as aging, obesity/diabetes, and hormonal deprivation. Dr.
Buettmann has assembled a mentoring team and collaborators with expertise in bone
regeneration/osteoimmunology (Drs. Olivares-Navarrete), optogenetics and muscle-bone mechanoregulation
(Dr. Megan Killian), musculoskeletal bioinformatics (Dr. Charles Farber), biomechanics (Dr. Hannah Dailey)
and mechanobiology (Dr. Henry Donahue). This project will prepare Dr. Buettmann for an independent
research career in musculoskeletal research by acquiring the necessary training and research data for an R01
equivalent award."
10916521,"Digital technologies can have enormous impact in the prediction, early detection, and tracking of Alzheimer’s
disease progression. In particular, there is a need to develop digital biomarkers that can detect early changes in
brain function before the onset of cognitive symptoms and/or brain biomarkers. The EEG is a compelling
candidate for an early “digital biomarker” of AD as numerous EEG features are known to be correlated with AD
progression and fundamental biomarkers. Unfortunately, there is limited evidence that these same EEG
measures, as currently constructed to describe population-level data, can accurately track, or predict AD
progression in individuals. One reason for this is that EEG signals have many sources of with- and between-
subject variation that are not accounted for in current analysis methods, leading to imprecise markers that only
have sufficient statistical power at the population-level. There have been recent advances in neural signal
processing that make it possible to account for these sources of error and in turn dramatically improve the
precision of EEG-derived measures. Over the past several years our lab has made significant strides to account
for these sources of error leading us to develop novel, sophisticated signal processing algorithms that can
enhance the precision of EEG derived measures. Through the specific aims of this project, we seek to provide
the AD research community with a suite of powerful, accessible signal processing software tools that will
dramatically enhance the precision and quality of EEG-derived biomarkers related to AD progression."

10884451,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use among young adult college students remains a major public health concern, with recent
escalations in nonmedical Adderall use, vaping nicotine, and co-use of alcohol and cannabis. The landscape of
substance use continues to evolve, with new modes of use (e.g., vaping) and rapid legislative changes. Daily
use behaviors can take many forms, defined by number and type of substances used, mode of use, and
quantity used. Further, daily use patterns may be related to both day-level psychosocial factors (e.g., motives,
affect, stress) and person-level characteristics (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, financial strain). Use of multiple
substances within a day (“co-use”) is increasingly prevalent and confers high risk for acute and chronic
consequences, but is insufficiently studied. The unprecedented amount of high-quality, intensive longitudinal
data (ILD) on substance use and associated risk factors holds critical information that can help explain
substance use etiology and inform the development of the next generation of interventions that are tailored to
those who need it, when they need it. However, advanced methods for analyzing ILD—including multilevel
latent class analysis (MLCA) and multilevel latent transition analysis (MLTA)—are needed to characterize the
heterogeneity of patterns of use that unfold in daily life and to identify novel day-level intervention targets.
These methods enable researchers to discover clinically relevant substance use behavior patterns and day-to-
day transitions, dynamic risk factors embedded in daily life that are associated with problematic use patterns,
and person-level characteristics that indicate for whom these risk factors are most salient. Yet MLCA and
MLTA are underused for ILD analysis, in part due to the dearth of guidance for applied researchers. Guided by
a socio-ecological framework, we will evaluate, apply, and disseminate MLCA and MLTA to analyze ILD,
considering four ways to specify models: marginal modeling, a fully parametric random effects model, a
common factor model, and a non-parametric approach for random effects. We will translate best practices for
applying MLCA (Aim 1) and MLTA (Aim 2) to ILD on substance use and co-use. We will conduct coordinated
MLCA and MLTA of daily data from two large studies of college students (3CAM: n=343, 15,798 person-days;
Project SELF: n=2068, 33,722 person-days). Empirical analyses will disentangle person-level risk factors (e.g.,
trait anxiety) and dynamic risk factors (e.g., morning affect) to isolate potential novel, dynamic intervention
targets. We will examine individual characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity) as moderators to investigate disparities
and identify group-specific mechanisms. To maximize our overall impact (Aim 3) and ensure broad, rigorous
adoption of MLCA and MLTA, we propose a broad range of dissemination activities to include online
instructional material, a code repository, workshops, and a conference. Findings from studies using these
techniques will guide prevention scientists and clinicians in designing interventions targeting the most salient
risk factors for specific individuals at the best time for intervention."
10929489,"Project Summary
The number of Americans with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is projected to reach almost 14 million by 2050,
highlighting the urgent need for biomarkers to monitor and predict disease progression, especially at its early
stages. The existing “AT(N)” framework includes imaging of three key AD hallmarks: amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques
(A) and tau neurofibrillary tangles (T), using Positron Emission Tomography (PET); and neurodegeneration (N),
using structural MRI volumetry and Fluorodeoxyglucose PET. These AT(N) markers provide the crucial ability to
stage AD, but are not fully capable of robust prognostication of disease progression, especially in early disease.
Imaging biomarkers for other important molecular processes and homeostatic networks impaired in AD, are
therefore needed to complement the AT(N) framework.
This project proposes the use of magnetic resonance-based biomarkers of intracellular viscosity, which is of
fundamental importance for proper cellular function, and is closely linked to AD pathophysiology. We recently
pioneered a rapid and robust technique termed Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Fingerprinting (MRSF),
which can quantify changes to intracellular viscosity separately within neurons and astrocytes. MRSF does so
by measuring the relaxation times (T1, T2) of two cell-type specific metabolites: N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), which
is confined to neurons, and myo-inositol (mI), which is confined to astrocytes. We have received approval from
the NIA-funded NYU AD Research Center to include our MRSF sequence within their routine tau-PET/MRI
protocol. This will allow a serial follow-up of a large cohort of cognitively normal individuals and patients with mild
cognitive impairment. Both sets of subjects will undergo yearly neurocognitive assessments, plasma Aβ and
plasma tau evaluations; and biennial Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and MRI+MRSF scans. The project has the following
hypotheses: (H1) Reduced NAA relaxation times, and elevated mI relaxation times will predict the hallmarks of
AD progression: cognitive decline, atrophy and tau accumulation. (H2) These relaxation times, alongside NAA
and mI concentrations, will improve the ability of Aβ-PET, tau-PET and MRI atrophy to predict future cognitive
decline. (H3) Replacing Aβ-PET and tau-PET in H2 by cost-effective and easy-to-collect plasma Aβ and plasma
tau will provide the same or better statistical power for predicting cognitive decline.
The expected outcome of this work is a set of novel markers for neuronal and astrocytic intracellular viscosity
which will potentially become biomarkers for early prediction of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD,
addressing gaps in the current imaging armamentarium of the AT(N) network."

The NIDA News Release
for August 2022 highlights the striking problem that young adults in the US face as
the COVID-19 pandemic endures: “Marijuana and hallucinogen use among young adults reached all time-high
in 2021…past-month nicotine and marijuana vaping levels rebound after early pandemic drop.” We propose a
randomized controlled trial of ÚNETE, an innovative multilevel strategy that combines friendship support
networks and targeted messaging from celebrity influencers (actors, singers and sport players) to reduce drug
use disparities and the negative effects of social determinants of health in Latinx communities. We will focus on
low-income, young adult Latinx (19 to 30 years old), who, as predominantly immigrants or first-generation US
citizens, suffer from health disparities as well as discrimination. ÚNETE will be implemented in South Florida,
where Latinx are 69% of residents, and are three times as likely as non-Latinx Whites to live below the poverty
line. Our overall goal is to evaluate effectiveness of the ÚNETE strategy to reduce drug use (marijuana,
hallucinogen, nicotine and marijuana vaping). The strategy has three components: 1. Celebrity Influencer
Component of 30 celebrities. We will work with celebrity influencers and low-income, young adult Latinx to
develop and culturally tailor messages to facilitate conversations and improve friends’ understanding of the
risks of drug use. We will produce and pre-test these messages, featuring celebrity influencers, in multiple
formats to allow dissemination through principal media channels (television, radio, streaming video, websites,
gaming, interactive). 2. Latinx Friendship Networks (groups of 13 friends). Community Health Workers
(CHWs) will map the structure of each friendship network. CHWs and popular individuals from each network
will use this information to design a one- three- and nine-month plan to increase drug use prevention
conversations based on celebrity messages. 3. CHWs will encourage information sharing of Social
Determinants of Health Services provided by our community partners (e.g., food security, ESL, housing and
transportation, legal services), and build network cohesion to increase peer support for accessing these
services. Participants will be randomly assigned to either ÚNETE (N=24 seeds and 288 recruits through
friendship ties) or a standard health promotion (N=312). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, and 12
months. ÚNETE’s multidisciplinary team includes a Latinx PI working with Latinx communities, two of the most
important community organizations providing social determinant of health services to low-income Latinx in
South Florida (Open Arms and MUJER), experts in celebrity-based campaigns with international and local
Latinx celebrities, and a Latinx broadcast media partner that reaches and engages Latinx throughout the US.
ÚNETE is innovative and high impact because its use of tailored messages from celebrity influencers amplified
through Latinx friendship networks can scale up interventions reaching larger populations, generating broad
impacts to public health and increase access to services addressing social determinants of health."
10890163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a smoking-associated respiratory disease and is the 3rd lead-
ing cause of death worldwide. There are increased numbers of dysfunctional airway and alveolar macrophages
(AMs) in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients, localizing to areas of injury. Despite this connection, the
mechanisms behind how cigarette smoke (CS) elicits AM dysfunction, and how AM dysfunction facilitates the
development of small airways disease and emphysema, two defining features of COPD, are poorly understood.
This proposal addresses this critical gap in knowledge and tests the hypothesis that AM dysfunction in COPD is
mechanistically linked to abnormal iron accumulation in these cells. Using a multicenter prospective COPD
(SPIROMICS) cohort, we previously associated increased levels of iron and iron-related proteins in the bron-
choalveolar lavage fluid of smokers and COPD patients with adverse clinical COPD outcomes. AMs are the
putative source for this lung extracellular iron, as AMs from smokers and COPD patients are iron-overloaded
and release iron in culture. We replicated this clinical phenomenon of AM iron accumulation and release using
a murine CS-exposure model. We then used single-cell RNA sequencing and discovered novel AM subsets
which have a unique iron-related gene expression signature that is consistent with increased iron uptake. These
“iron macrophages”, which we designate as FeMacs, have decreased expression of genes associated with
phagocytosis and immune activation, suggesting that this CS-induced AM iron accumulation may have functional
consequences for AMs, and potentially for the CS-exposed lung. We will test our hypothesis that FeMacs or-
chestrate lung injury development in COPD both mechanistically using our murine CS model and translationally
using the SPIROMICS cohort. Aim 1 will compare CS-induced small airways damage and emphysema develop-
ment between control mice and mice with AMs deficient in nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (Ncoa4ΔCd11c), an iron
metabolism defect which mitigates CS-induced iron accumulation. Aim 2 examines Ncoa4ΔCd11c and Ncoa4fl/fl
control mice in a CS-Streptococcus pneumoniae infection 2-hit model, thereby determining whether reducing
AM iron overload can alleviate CS-induced AM dysfunction and improve response to pathogen. Aim 3 defines
the clinical relevance of AM iron accumulation in human COPD and tests AM expression of iron genes and AM
iron content as markers of COPD severity. This proposal presents a five-year career development plan that
builds on my previous research and integrates the different domains of expertise of my mentorship and advisory
teams. It entails a targeted training plan that is tailored towards the development of specific areas related to
immunology, macrophage biology, iron biology, and translational research, facilitated by the physical and intel-
lectual resources provided by the academic environment at Weill Cornell Medicine. The proposed experiments,
didactic training, as well as mentorship team will position me with a unique set of interdisciplinary skills that will
enable my transition to independence as a physician-scientist in lung and macrophage biology and iron biology."
10739482,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human microbiome is a rich ecosystem that contains microbes from all domains of life, including bacteria,
archaea, and eukaryotes such as fungi and protists. The gut microbiome exerts an important influence on the
immune system, both in healthy and disease states. While the bacterial components of the microbiome have
been well studied, little is known about the eukaryotic fraction. Eukaryotic protists, such as Blastocystis, are
commonly found in the human gut. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that these commensal protists
remodel the gut bacterial community and protect the host from gut inflammation, though the mechanisms of
these actions remain completely unknown. These observations are at odds with traditional medical views that
these protists are pathogenic; indeed, samples containing them are excluded from fecal microbiome transplant
therapies due to a belief that they are harmful. Very little is known about the biology of commensal gut protists,
including their genome sequences and how they interact with microbiome bacteria or the human host. In this
proposal, high quality genomics of the most common human commensal protist Blastocysis will be established
and two mechanisms of interaction with the microbiome and host will be investigated: bacterial predation and
metabolite production. In Aim 1, high-quality, contiguous, and well-annotated genome assemblies of multiple
Blastocystis subtypes will be generated. These high-quality assemblies will be used to determine the core and
pan-genome content of the species and reveal functional pathways specific to individual subtypes that contribute
to their microbiome functions. Using these genomes in combination with shotgun metagenomic sequencing will
reveal whether this organism reproduces sexually. In Aim 2, the hypothesis that Blastocystis are bacterial
predators will be tested through co-culturing experiments with bacteria identified to co-occur and co-exclude with
these protists in the gut microbiome. In Aim 3, the small molecule repertoire of Blastocystis will be determined in
vitro and in vivo, and how this organism influences the host-facing metabolome will be established. These
experiments will further establish a rich source of metabolic data for future functional studies of host interactions.
The work proposed here will establish gut commensal protist genomics and reveal fundamental mechanisms by
which these organisms interact with the host and bacterial members of the microbiome. These findings have
potential to indicate protists or their metabolites for use as probiotic interventions in inflammatory bowel diseases.
The proposed work in this proposal will leverage the candidate’s expertise in the field of microbial eukaryotes
with an expert interdisciplinary scientific advisory committee, enabling the candidate to establish a successful
independent research program."
10930883,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The central goal of this proposal is to investigate retinal microglial phenotypes as they relate to novel forms of
tauopathy and amyloidosis in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD) retina and to determine their connections to retinal
neurovascular unit alterations and synaptic loss as well as disease status in the brain. We will analyze
postmortem retinas and paired brains from neuropathologically well-characterized patient donors with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia, and normal cognition (NC), and resilient subjects who remained
cognitively normal despite having AD pathology. Evidence of AD pathological hallmarks—amyloid β-protein (Aβ)
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyper-phosphorylated (p)tau protein—extending to the
accessible retina is mounting, with parallels between retinal and brain pathology. Recently, we identified early
and progressive deficiency in vascular platelet–derived growth factor receptor beta (vPDGFRβ) and pericyte loss
in postmortem retinas of MCI and AD patients. Retinal vPDGFRβ was associated with retinal vAβ40 and vAβ42
loads, cerebral amyloid angiopathy severity, and cognitive scores. In old APPSWE/PS1ΔE9-transgenic (AD+) model
mice, we revealed similarities between retinal and brain pathology and immunotherapy response. We also found
that retinal capillary and vPDGFRβ losses link to vascular Aβ deposits in young and adult AD+ mice, and are
associated with altered inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB) tight junctions and BRB leakage. In humans, our
preliminary data suggest the existence of Aβ oligomers, diverse pTau and citrullinated Tau forms, microgliosis,
astrogliosis, and cell-specific and synaptic losses in the retinas of MCI and AD patients, which correlate with
brain Aβ, tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and cognitive status. Proteomics analysis identified novel molecular
signatures of AD in the retina, with the largest overlap with a cortical region. Most significant pathways in the AD
retina are related to inflammation, metabolic/mitochondrial damage, and neurodegeneration, especially in
photoreceptors. Our initial findings also indicate increased neurodegeneration-associated microglia (MGnD)
markers in the AD retina. In this project, retinal spatial distribution of AD hallmark pathology and associated
inflammatory, neurovascular, and neurodegenerative markers will be determined and correlated with respective
brain pathology and cognition. The specific objectives include 1) Characterize inflammatory processes and
MGnD in relation to novel forms of tauopathy and amyloidosis in retinas of MCI and AD patients versus NC and
resilient subjects; 2) Investigate synaptic and cell-type vulnerabilities and define their relations to tauopathy and
microglial phenotypes in the same human cohort; and 3) Determine if iBRB damage is associated with vascular
amyloidosis, tauopathy and inflammation in the human AD retina and in murine models. Computational data
science tools will be applied to integrate the multi-omics data sets. Results will offer a deeper understanding of
the molecular and cellular inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegeneration mechanisms of retinal and brain AD
pathology, paving the path for novel therapeutic targets and next-generation retinal imaging diagnostic strategies."
10888414,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic stress during the developmental period of adolescence increases the susceptibility to many
neuropsychiatric diseases in adulthood, including alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behaviors. Social isolation is
a particularly profound stressor with increasing human relevance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,
when millions of adolescents have faced prolonged periods with limited and intermittent social interactions with
peers. The endocannabinoid system (ECs) is critically involved in brain development and modulates synaptic
transmission processes, including those in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a hub of stress and anxiety
processing. A growing body of evidence indicates that adolescent social isolation stress and alcohol drinking
hijacks the developing brain by disrupting the ECs and resulting in long-lasting synaptic neuroadaptations that
predispose to alcohol use disorder (AUD), anxiety, aggressive behaviors, and social interaction deficits. Unlike
adult alcohol exposure, the synaptic and behavioral effects of adolescent binge drinking often do not recover
following periods of abstinence, suggesting that experiencing social isolation and alcohol drinking during
adolescence has the potential to permanently disrupt the brain’s developmental trajectory. Here, I will utilize a
modified model of intermittent social isolation stress to examine 1) the effect of intermittent social isolation on
alcohol intake and preference during adolescence (PND28-56) in male and female Wistar rats and 2) identify
the individual and synergistic consequences of adolescent social isolation and alcohol drinking on the EC-
mediated mechanisms contributing to the anxiety-like behaviors and social interactions long-term effects.
Additionally, I will assess the ECs neuroadaptations in the CeA and validate ECs as a potential drug target (AIM
1/K99). My hypothesis is that adolescent isolation stress and alcohol drinking induce lasting alterations on
GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling in the CeA via maladaptive functions (downregulation) of the ECs (AIM
2/K99-R00). Finally, given that previous work as well as my preliminary data suggest that manipulating the ECs
reduces alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behaviors, I will assess whether increasing endocannabinoids’ tone
(i.e., 2-AG) during the abstinence period post-adolescence, by blocking ECs enzymatic degradation, is
efficacious in reducing the anxious phenotype and in preventing drinking relapse in adulthood (AIM 3/R00). The
K99 portion of this proposal involves extensive training using molecular and electrophysiological approaches to
probe the functional protective role of the ECs system against later escalations in alcohol drinking and anxiety-
like behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will provide critical insights into the impact of adolescent isolation
stress and alcohol drinking on the resulting behavior and synaptic transmission in both sexes and will validate
the ECs as druggable target for AUD and comorbid behaviors. The technical and conceptual training I will receive
during this award will equip me with the multidisciplinary approach needed to continue this research line
independently."
10739031,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
This Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) proposal requests a single-cell library preparation system
as a common resource for VA New Jersey Healthcare System (VANJHCS) Investigators. Comprising (1)
Namocell Pala Single Cell Dispenser and (2) 10x Genomics Chromium Connect, this assembled single cell
system will provide five major VA-Merit Award researchers and three minor VANJHCS researchers the ability to
efficiently and reproducibly prepare single cell RNA libraries for sequencing (scRNA-seq), across a diverse group
of VA research priorities in: traumatic brain injury (Drs. Yun-Beom Choi, Bruce Citron, and Vedad Delic),
neurodegeneration & immunology in Parkinson's disease (Drs. James Park and Wei Lu), and melanoma treated
with glutaminergic & checkpoint inhibition (Dr. Suzie Chen), bile acid signaling in infiltrating immune cells during
hepatocellular carcinoma development and progression (Dr. Grace Guo), and T-cell biology such as fate
differentiation during infection (Dr. Hai-Hui (Howard) Xue). The capabilities of this single-cell RNA library
preparation system are not available within VANJHCS and are critical to ongoing and planned research projects.
Human disease begins with the cell. An aberrant transcriptome is one of the first manifestations of incipient
disease but is often masked or convolved by cellular heterogeneity and bulk sequencing. Single cell analysis
reveals insights that are hidden in bulk cell analysis. scRNA-seq has been widely employed to deconvolve under-
appreciated cellular heterogeneity, dissect gene regulatory networks, and reveal novel mechanistic insights
necessary to improve diagnostics and therapeutics. Because of these considerations, single cell analysis is
positioned at the center of a modern high-resolution biomedical investigational tool kit. Reproducible and efficient
single cell library preparation has become necessary. Reproducibility stems from Namocell Pala Single Cell
Dispenser's ability to reliably screen for fully dissociated and viable single cells. High quality single cell input from
Pala Single Cell Dispenser for 10x Genomics Connect is an essential consideration in nervous system, hepatic,
and dermal tissues in which cells are networked by extracellular matrices making single cell preparation
challenging and variable. 10x Genomics Chromium Connect's efficiency stems from the robot's ability to save
an entire working day of investigator liquid-handling time per single cell preparation run. 10x Connect's liquid-
handling consistency ensures the reproducibility of scRNA data. As a bonus, Pala Single Cell Dispenser not only
serves upstream in the library preparation workflow by screening out cellular doublets, debris, and death, the
Pala Single Cell Dispenser can also perform double-duty downstream of 10x Connect by efficiently selecting for
CRISPR-edited single cells, saving a month of investigator-CRISPR screening time. Designing and selecting
CRISPR-edited single cells is often a logical follow-up experiment after scRNA-seq analysis and interpretation.
In summary, the availability of a single cell RNA library preparation system and the ability to efficiently generate
CRISPR-edited single cells will further enable Merit-funded VANJHCS investigators to conduct high-resolution
research on their respective diseases and identify pathways for translational applications in diagnosis, prognosis,
and therapeutic strategies. These endeavors will substantially contribute to the long-term research goals of the
VANJHCS. All VANJHCS Merit projects have significant implications for health, and the single cell RNA library
preparation system we are requesting will facilitate the progress of these productive projects, as well as further
stimulate an esprit de corps in VANJHCS Merit research programs on diseases of high relevance to Veterans."

Wildfire smoke exposure is thought to be responsible for increased morbidity and 339,000 annual deaths, but
little is known about cardiovascular (CV) effects. It is well known that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the air
pollution component most strongly linked to morbidity and mortality, mostly due to ischemic CV diseases.
Extending these effects to biomass burning aerosol (BBA) generated from wildfires is not directly translatable
since most studies on CV toxicity of PM2.5 investigate urban PM2.5 which has significant differences in chemical
and toxicological profiles compared to BBA. Some suggest BBA exhibits higher CV toxicity compared to non-
wildland sources, which may be due to the ability of BBA components to disrupt pulmonary Fe homeostasis.
BBA are enriched in atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS), complex water-soluble organics that have
been shown to disrupt pulmonary Fe homeostasis resulting in a functional Fe deficiency that can lead to Fe
overload, oxidative stress, and in inflammatory response. Importantly, no study has every investigated the impact
of BBA or HULIS exposure on the progression of atherosclerosis. Our central hypothesis is BBA, and HULIS in
particular, disrupts Fe homeostasis in pulmonary and systemic tissues leading to increased inflammation and
worsened atherosclerosis. In this K99/R00 MOSAIC application, we propose to use laboratory generated BBA
in cell culture and controlled in vivo inhalation exposures. In Aim 1, murine alveolar epithelial and alveolar
macrophage cultures will be exposed to BBA and HULIS for assessment of changes in Fe homeostasis, oxidative
stress, inflammation, and proatherogenic metabolites. We will employ Hepcidin Knockout (HKO) mice as models
of Fe overload in alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Aim 2 explores if in vivo BBA exposure
exacerbates atherosclerotic lesions in low density lipoprotein receptor knockout (Ldlr-KO) mice on a high fat diet
and whether Fe overload in pulmonary and systemic tissues play a role. Aim 1 is proposed to be completed by
the candidate under the mentorship of Dr. Jesus Araujo during the K99 phase. Aim 2 will be independently
facilitated by the candidate during the R00 phase following appointment to a faculty position. In addition to this
research, this K99/R00 MOSAIC will provide support for further training and career development for the
candidate. The applicant's long-term goal is to be an independent faculty at a tier-1 university and continue air
pollution toxicology research. To achieve this, we propose three training goals for the K99 phase: (1) Enhance
Biomedical Education, (2) Develop Skills in In Vitro Methods and (3) Acquire Training in Biostatistics. Dr. Araujo's
lab at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA is an ideal environment for successful completion of K99
research as well as achieving training goals and preparing the candidate for saucerful transition to independence.
Support in the R00 phase will facilitate the candidate's transition to independence simultaneously advancing the
candidate's and NIH diversity goals."

Kidneys from deceased African American donors have reduced allograft survival compared to kidneys from
donors from European Americans. Likewise, kidneys from deceased donors with 2 apolipoprotein L1 gene
(APOL1) renal-risk variants, defined as APOL1 high-risk genotypes, have shorter allograft survival. Importantly,
many kidneys transplanted from deceased donors with 2 APOL1 risk variants do not fail rapidly. We postulate
that APOL1 interacts with other environmental or inherited factors to accelerate the failure of kidneys
transplanted from deceased donors. APOL1 renal-risk variants are almost exclusively in individuals of recent
African ancestry. Relative differences in the prevalence of blood types and human leukocyte antigens lead to
more kidneys from deceased African American donors being allocated to African Americans, potentially
exacerbating disparities in transplant outcomes. African American living kidney donors face a greater risk of
post-donation kidney failure compared to White living donors, but including APOL1 genotyping in the evaluation
and selection of African American donors remains controversial. The National Institutes of Health established
the “APOL1 Long-term Kidney Transplantation Outcomes” (APOLLO) Consortium in 2017 to prospectively
address several critical questions regarding the broad implementation of APOL1 genotyping in kidney
transplantation and to assess its role in the evaluation of living donors. APOLLO assesses factors determining
time to allograft failure (primary outcome), post-transplant kidney function and proteinuria (secondary
outcomes) in kidneys from donors with recent African ancestry. The APOLLO Consortium includes a Scientific
and Data Research Center (SDRC) and 13 Clinical Centers, including our Center with 8 kidney transplant
programs, encompassing high-volume and smaller programs with diverse practice patterns and geographic
representation. Through 9/29/22, APOLLO, in its initial phase, has prospectively collected DNA from 3604
deceased donors and is following outcomes for the 4890 recipients. APOLLO has collected DNA from 2436
recipients of whom Clinical Center 04 (CC04) has enrolled 17.1% (417). CC04 also recruited 7% (15) of the
APOLLO living donors and their recipients. In the proposed APOLLO Phase 2 study, we will prospectively
collect long-term follow-up data and measure urine albumin to creatinine ratio > 2 years after transplantation for
all APOLLO Phase 1 participants. For those at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, we will provide detailed
clinical data, collect biospecimens (blood and urine after 1st post-transplant year), and collect slides from all
allograft biopsies for APOLLO Digital Pathology Repository. Working with the SDRC, CC04 will return APOL1
genotype results to recipients and living donors at our aligned transplant programs. The results from this national
study have the potential to transform organ allocation and informed-consent processes for the transplantation of
kidneys from donors with recent African ancestry, improve kidney allograft survival, and elucidate the
mechanisms whereby APOL1 renal-risk variants produce kidney disease."

Since its inception in 2001, the CRIC Study has recruited and followed a racially and ethnically diverse cohort
of 5,625 participants with reduced kidney function from 13 recruitment sites at 7 Clinical Centers across the
US. The original aim of CRIC was to establish a clinical research laboratory designed to (a) identify novel
predictors of CKD progression, and (b) characterize the manifestations of cardiovascular disease and identify
its risk factors among individuals with CKD. As the landmark prospective cohort study of CKD, the CRIC Study
has accomplished extensive biological, physiological, and social phenotyping, longitudinal follow-up, and
ascertainment of clinical and patient-centered outcomes across multiple domains. Findings from the CRIC
Study have defined trajectories of CKD progression, catalogued development, and evolution of comorbidities in
CKD, and identified a diverse array of factors and pathways that explain the progression and complications of
CKD in adults. Through its highly productive Ancillary Studies and Opportunity Pool Programs, both the
scientific scope of the CRIC Study and the community of kidney disease researchers have been markedly
expanded. During the most recent funding cycle (Phase 4: 2018-2023), three innovative sub-protocol studies
were implemented to enrich CRIC data with highly granular home-based assessments of kidney function and
cardiovascular measures. During the fifth and final phase of the CRIC Study, the major focus will be to (1)
ascertain the clinical outcomes for all participants including those enrolled in the Phase 4 sub-protocols, (2)
perform analyses linking the sub-protocol measurements to clinical outcomes, (3) integrate data from multiple
domains to identify sub-phenotypes underlying the heterogeneity in CKD progression outcomes, (4) conduct
final study visits for the full CRIC cohort eligible for Phase 5, (5) create mechanisms for future data collection
via linkages with external sources of health data, and (6) generate tools and resources to facilitate ongoing use
of CRIC data and biospecimens by a broad group of investigators after the CRIC Study has officially ended.
The proposed activities will generate new scientific output and successfully transition the CRIC Study from its
active prospective cohort phase to a long-lasting resource for supporting ongoing and future mechanistic,
epidemiologic, and translational investigations."

We submit this application in response to RFA-DK-22-506. The North East Consortium for Transplant Outcomes
in APOL1 Kidney Recipients (NECTAR), APOLLO Clinical Center 6 (CC6), is a current member of the APOLLO
Consortium - a national consortium of transplant programs established in 2017, which collaborates with United
Network for Organ Sharing, Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, American Society of
Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics and Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. The goal of this
consortium is to prospectively evaluate the role of APOL1 kidney risk variants on graft outcomes in kidney
transplant recipients (KTRs) and kidney function of living donors (LD) with African ancestry. The APOL1 risk
variants G1 and G2 have a prevalence of 30% and 8%, respectively, among African Americans (AAs). Presence
of homozygous risk variants increases the risk of non-diabetic end-stage kidney disease by 7-10 fold.
NECTAR/CC6 oversees 6 Engaged transplant centers, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), Weill
Medical College-NewYork Presbyterian (WMC-NYP), New York University Medical Center, Northwell Health,
SUNY-Upstate Medical University, and 2 Non-Engaged transplant centers, SUNY- Stony Brook University
Hospital and Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. Our 8 centers have enrolled 125 recipients of
deceased donor kidneys, 30 living donor recipients, and 35 living donors with African ancestry and have
collected >90% the DNA for the total cohort of 190 enrollees. Our site has established regular communication
to monitor CC6 enrollment and oversee biospecimen collection and data entry at our own site and that of our
network centers to ensure accurate timely completion of forms. The goal of this current proposal is to continue
collaboration with the APOLLO Consortium to understand the potential modifiers of graft loss associated with
APOL1 kidney risk variants, identify biomarkers predictive of graft loss, and expand the database of LD with
African ancestry to better define kidney donor risk. In Phase 2, we will (1) re-engage/reconsent ALL study
participants enrolled in Phase 1 to collect long-term data on kidney function outcomes in KTRs and LDs, including
measurement of urine albumin to creatinine ratios, (2) obtain comprehensive data on post-transplant clinical
course of ALL KTRs to understand potential second hits, (3) collect additional urine and blood biospecimens
beyond 1 year post-transplant and kidney biopsy slides associated with diagnostic or surveillance kidney
biopsies at the main CC6 sites (ISMMS and WMC-NYP), (4) recruit new LD with African ancestry at ISMMS and
WMC-NYP, and (5) collaborate with Scientific Data and Coordinating Center to return genotype results of all
interested participants accurately and safely while adhering to rules of privacy of protected health information.
NECTAR/CC6 will participate in the Steering Committee and develop the necessary protocols for accurate and
complete data capture that will address the goals of this collaboration."
10912816,"Project Summary or Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of death in adults with Down
syndrome (DS) with >90% developing AD in their lifetime. This may be related to the abnormal accumulation of
amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau proteins which occur 20-30 years earlier in adults with DS compared with the
development of late-onset sporadic AD in typically developed adults. Data from typically developed adults
suggest that sedentary behavior (SB) and low moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are associated
with ~12% of AD. Current U.S. activity guidelines suggest that regular MVPA benefits brain health by reducing
the risk of dementia, improving cognition, and reducing sleep disruptions which may contribute to ~15% of AD
cases worldwide. To date, a limited number of trials have evaluated the association between physical activity
(PA) intensity and AD in adults with DS due in part to a lack of validated objective measures of these outcomes
in the DS population. Cut-points to assess PA intensity using the ActiGraph portable accelerometer worn at the
waist, a widely used objective measure of PA in health-related research, have been developed for typically
developed adults. However, biomechanical and physiological differences between typically developed adults
and adults with DS suggest that ActiGraph intensity cut-points validated for typically developed adults may be
inappropriate for use in adults with DS. Our preliminary data suggests that the cut-point for MVPA is ~50%
lower than the MVPA cut-point for typically developed adults. Thus, we may be vastly underestimating PA
levels in adults with DS. This K01 award consists of 2 aims and a training plan to begin to address the
assessment of activity intensity during daily life and the impact of PA intensity and duration on plasma
biomarkers associated with AD, cognitive function, and sleep quality in adults with DS. My short-term goals
and the focus of my research and training plan are to: 1) develop valid ActiGraph cut-points for the assessment
of daily PA in adults with DS; 2) acquire knowledge related to the neuropathology of AD including the
assessment of plasma biomarkers; and 3) develop proficiency in the measurement of free-living sleep and
cognition and the conduct of clinical trials relative to PA and AD in adults with DS. My long-term goal is to
become a funded investigator who is an internationally recognized expert in understanding the impact of PA on
brain aging and AD development in adults with DS. The first aim of this K01 is to develop and validate free-
living ActiGraph GT9X Link triaxial accelerometer activity intensity cut-points for sedentary, light, moderate,
and vigorous activity. The second aim is to explore the impact of SB, light PA, and MVPA on plasma
biomarkers associated with AD, cognitive function, and sleep quality in adults with DS participating in the NIH-
funded Alzheimer’s Biomarker Consortium - Down Syndrome (ABC-DS; U19 AG070043) study and Lifestyle

 Organisms use a variety of molecular mechanisms to adapt to their environments. RNA editing occurs
widely across organisms and generates non-synonymous codon changes in mRNAs, thereby altering the amino
acid sequence of proteins. In cephalopods and fungi, this ‘recoding’ generates incredible diversity in proteins
across most cellular processes. However, the functions of RNA recoding in these organisms are largely
unknown. How is RNA recoding used to support physiological needs and facilitate adaptation? The research
proposed here investigates how cephalopod and fungal RNA recoding regulates the function of proteins involved
in two core cellular processes: microtubule-based transport and DNA replication and repair. This work will
illuminate how RNA recoding modulates protein function to support phenotypic plasticity and adaptation and will
advance our understanding of the regulation and functions of highly conserved cellular machineries.
 In Aim 1, Dr. Rangan will investigate how RNA recoding diversifies the function of microtubule motor
protein complexes. In the K99 phase, she will evaluate the effects of RNA recoding on dynein and kinesin motor
complexes using in vivo cargo transport assays and single-molecule motility assays. She will also investigate
how RNA recoding of motor proteins is coordinated at different temperatures in squid to facilitate transport.
 In Aim 2, Dr. Rangan will investigate how RNA recoding alters the function of DNA replication and repair
proteins. In the K99 phase, she will characterize the effects of RNA recoding on DNA polymerases epsilon and
zeta using assays for mutation rate, fidelity, and processivity. In the R00 phase, she will evaluate how
temperature-dependent recoding of DNA polymerases alters function and extend this characterization to other
proteins involved in DNA replication and repair.
 In Aim 3, Dr. Rangan will explore how RNA recoding of DNA replication machinery influences genomic
mutation rate and bias in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In the K99 phase, she will use RNA-seq to
evaluate temperature-dependent changes in RNA editing in Neurospora ascospores. During the R00 phase, she
will perform mutation accumulation experiments with recoding site mutants and wild type fungi to elucidate the
role of RNA recoding in mutagenesis.
 Dr. Rangan is committed to developing an independent research program centered around investigating
how RNA editing in diverse organisms supports phenotypic plasticity and adaptation. To facilitate her transition
to independence, she will attend diverse scientific conferences and participate in UCSD classes on topics of
career development and lab management. She will receive guidance and support from her mentoring committee
and her primary mentor, Sam Reck-Peterson. This development plan, combined with training in bioinformatics
and computational genomics (with Ludmil Alexandrov, UC San Diego) as well as Neurospora biology and
genetics (with Katherine Borkovich, UC Riverside) will prepare her for success in an independent career."
10889258,"Project Summary
 The hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) microenvironment in the bone marrow, termed the niche, provides a
specialized microenvironment to control the proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation and migration of HSCs.
HSC aging is accompanied by an expansion of myeloid-biased HSCs with declined self-renewal functions. Aging
of HSCs is associated with various age-related blood diseases, such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate
potential (CHIP). Whether the aged microenvironment drives the aging of HSCs and age-related hematologic
diseases, however, remains unclear.
 I recently demonstrated that the nociceptive nervous system is an essential HSC niche component that
regulates granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced HSC mobilization via the secretion of
neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the bone marrow. Our preliminary data reveal a
significant reduction of CGRP levels in the aged bone marrow microenvironment, and administration of CGRP
attenuates aging-associated phenotypes of HSCs in the old mice, resulting in a reduced number of HSCs and a
restored myeloid versus lymphoid balance. In addition, we find that aged bone marrow microenvironment
promotes the clonal expansion of genetically mutated HSCs (Asxl1tm/+ HSCs) over wildtype HSCs.
 Based on these preliminary data, we propose a 5-year experimental plan to characterize the functions of
nociceptive neurons in the aged bonne marrow microenvironment and to dissect the contributions of aged bone
marrow microenvironment to clonal hematopoiesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will evaluate the impact of aging on
nociceptive neurons in the bone marrow. We will determine whether aging induces the loss of nociceptive fibers
or reduces the CGRP levels without affecting the nociceptive innervation in the bone marrow. We will explore
the mechanisms by which nociceptor-derived CGRP signals in the bone marrow drive the aging of HSCs. We
will investigate whether modulation of CGRP signaling via ingestion of food containing capsaicin – a natural
component of chili peppers that could trigger the activation of nociceptive neurons – could rejuvenate the
functional and molecular aging signatures of HSCs. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine how aged bone marrow
microenvironment interacts with HSCs to promote the Asxl1tm/+ mutant clonal hematopoiesis and explore whether
targeting the aged bone marrow microenvironment could prevent Asxl1tm/+ HSC expansion. These proposed
studies, focusing on the interactions between bone marrow niche and HSCs, will allow us to identify new extrinsic
factors regulating HSC aging and potentially provide novel approaches to rejuvenate HSCs and prevent age-
related hematologic diseases."
10848435,"Project Summary: Animals perform goal-directed behaviors in complex environments, without the need for
extensive experience, by harnessing an internal model of the world. These internal models, or cognitive maps,
are central to model-based decision making. Importantly, understanding the neural circuitry of model-based
decisions holds promise for improving treatments of neuropsychiatric disorders in which decision-making goes
awry. An outstanding question in reinforcement learning (RL) is how cognitive maps are learned from experience,
and what neural substrates support them. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been implicated in representing
cognitive maps, and this project proposes to characterize the emergence of a cognitive map in rodent OFC during
a value-based decision making task. This project asks three core questions: 1) How does a model-based RL
agent learn a cognitive map using purely model-free RL methods? Here recent advances in meta-RL in state-of-
the-art recurrent neural network (RNN) models will be trained with model-free RL, in which the emergence of a
cognitive map can be fully characterized. 2) How does the OFC represent cognitive maps? Here partially trained
rats will be implanted with Neuropixels probes, and neural recordings will capture emerging representations
of cognitive maps in population-level OFC activity as rats learn the task structure. 3) Can poor learning of
cognitive maps be bolstered with structured behavioral training? An attractive therapeutic approach for improving
decision making strategies is through behavioral training alone, and here an RNN model of rodents will be used
to characterize modes of poor learning and develop prescriptive training, and will then be employed in rats to
uniquely addresses specific learning deficits.
This proposed project employs both experimental and computational techniques as part a comprehensive career
development plan toward becoming an independent investigator. Specific experimental training for electrophysi-
ological recordings from behaving animals complements computational training on modeling neural activity with
deep neural networks. The career development plan also includes structured opportunities for collaborating with
experimentalists. It incorporates a breadth of science communication experiences through research conferences
and public talks within the local training institution. Importantly, the career development plan incorporates targeted
preparation for independent investigator applications, including chalk-talk opportunities, workshops to develop
unique research questions, and exposure to the faculty search process. The Constantinople, Savin, and Glim-
cher labs at New York University’s Center for Neural Science are a training environment uniquely positioned to
deliver this interdisciplinary training: their cutting-edge research into decision-making, animal behavior, reinforce-
ment learning, and systems neuroscience make it an ideal institution and set of labs to develop a health-related
career studying decision-making strategies in neuroscience."
10739659,"The “amyloid hypothesis” posits that Amyloid β (Aβ) misfolds, oligomerizes to soluble species, and thereby
contributes to neurodegenerative Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent support for the hypothesis comes from a
new antibody, Lecanemab, that targets Aβ and its aggregation and significantly reduces clinical decline. Still, the
aggregation is not understood, leaving a weak foundation for building new therapeutics. In the transition from
monomer to fibril, Aβ exists in soluble, putatively neurotoxic species in mixtures of varied sizes and morphologies.
Complicating matters further is the unknown molecular role of apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a family of partially
disordered proteins including an isoform, ApoE4, that is one of few biomarkers for AD. The aggregate mixture
and the interactions of Aβ with apoE4 and with lipids constituting cell membranes are too complex for many
structural characterization techniques. Protein footprinting coupled with mass spectrometry, however, can
provide a measure of solvent accessibility, local dynamics and structure, hydrogen bonding, sites of ligand-
binding, and oligomerization, with spatial resolution at the peptide and amino-acid residue levels. Considerable
preliminary data establish that this technique can provide structural details not obtainable by other methods. This
footprinting technique has not yet been systematically or rigorously applied to characterize the soluble
intermediates formed in amyloidogenic protein aggregation, and this is our goal. We will chemically footprint Aβ
and ApoE alone or together by using both pulsed hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) and irreversible
modification by highly reactive species (free radicals, carbenes, carbocations). For the latter, we will utilize the
“Fast Photochemical Oxidation of Proteins” or “FPOP” platform, which we invented. Both HDX and FPOP are
used in a differential mode where changes in structure are determined as a function of aggregation time or
increasing media complexity. Utilization of optimized reagents will be coupled with separation and kinetic
modeling to reduce heterogeneity and analyze the aggregation pathways and the varied structures or
morphologies of the oligomers. We will then apply these optimized footprinting approaches in complex media
containing lipids, small molecules, and other proteins including antibodies to reveal how aggregation changes
upon perturbation with these substances. We will be guided by powerful Density Functional Theory that can
probe small molecule/Aβ interactions Once the footprinting and data processing pass rigorous validation, we will
apply them to Aβ and ApoE in a system of reprogrammed neurons that recapitulate the pathophysiology of AD
patients. This system succeeds where pluripotent stem cells and mouse models do not because they don’t carry
age information, and age correlates strongly with AD. The proposed research will bring new understanding of
Aβ aggregation and of ApoE interactions with regional and amino acid resolution in relevant media. It will also
define and characterize a novel and potentially informative approach for gaining insight on neurodegenerative
diseases."

Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and females who experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS,
hot flushes and night sweats) have a 55% greater risk for CVD compared with females who do not experience
VMS. Because CVD is the leading cause of mortality in females in the US, the factors contributing to CVD in
menopausal females are critical to determine and yet are unclear. Autonomic and vascular dysregulation, often
demonstrated in postmenopausal females, is associated with CVD, but whether this dysregulation exists
specifically in females with VMS is unknown. Further, how hot flushes, a major VMS, alter autonomic function
has not been well defined. This application for a NIH R21 is designed to identify mechanistic pathways to
determine how VMS lead to CVD. Dr. Manda L Keller-Ross, DPT, PhD, an Assistant Professor in the Department
of Rehabilitation Medicine, in the Medical School at the University of Minnesota, is the PI of the Cardiovascular
Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory, where the proposed research will take place. The long-term objectives
of this proposal are to determine the link between VMS and CVD in menopausal females. Specifically, Dr. Keller-
Ross aims to determine the extent that females who experience VMS demonstrate autonomic and vascular
dysregulation (Aim 1). She will then delineate the mechanism by which hot flushes alter autonomic regulation
(Aim 2). This proposal is in line with the mission of the NIA, to understand the nature of the aging process in
females and how factors associated with menopause contribute to the number-one cause of death in females,
CVD. Dr. Keller-Ross seeks to conduct an exploratory study to interrogate the thermoregulatory system in
females by inducing hot flushes and investigating how hot flushes alter autonomic function. To accomplish
these research objectives, Dr. Keller-Ross and Dr. Blas (Co-I) will use gold-standard techniques combined
with an innovative methodological approach to quantify autonomic and vascular dysregulation in females with
VMS. Aim 1 will quantify muscle sympathetic activity (MSNA), measured via microneurography; endothelial
dysfunction, measured with Endothelial Pulse Amplitude Tonometry; vascular conductance, measured via
venous occlusion plethysmography; and baroreflex sensitivity in postmenopausal females who experience VMS.
We hypothesize that females with VMS will demonstrate elevated MSNA, reduced vascular conductance and
impaired endothelial function, leading to elevated BP, compared with females without VMS. Aim 2 will explore
the extent to which a hot flush, induced by a temperature-controlled, water-circulating heating pad, alters
autonomic function in postmenopausal females. We hypothesize that a hot flush will cause an increase in MSNA,
contributing to chronic autonomic dysregulation of BP in menopausal females. By identifying the link between
VMS and CVD, we will set the stage for the development of novel therapies and optimization of current treatments
for VMS with the goal of reducing sympathetic activity and restoring autonomic and vascular function to mitigate
CVD risk in females, particularly for those who experience VMS."

Subretinal fibrosis, an end-stage fibrous plaque/disciform scar that progresses from choroidal neovascularization
(CNV) of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), compromises highly organized anatomical
layers and tightly coordinated cellular interactions, inevitably leading to irreversible visual impairment. Current
treatment for subretinal fibrosis is limited; thus, therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of subretinal fibrosis are
essential.
 Many types of cells, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, contribute to subretinal fibrosis by
differentiating into mesenchymal-like cells, α-smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts and/or producing
profibrotic and proinflammatory factors. However, the underlying metabolic mechanisms for these cellular and
molecular activities are not well defined. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway utilized by many proliferative cells.
my preliminary data show that cells in subretinal fibrotic areas are hyper-glycolytic, as evidenced by increased
expression of glycolytic enzymes and glycolytic regulators/activators including 6-phosphofructo-2-
kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase isoform 3 (PFKFB3), a critical enzyme for activation of glycolysis in various
highly proliferative cells. PFKFB3 catalyzes the synthesis of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2, 6P2), which is the
most potent allosteric activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis. I have
found that high levels of glycolytic enzymes including PFKFB3 are present in the RPE/choroid complex isolated
from laser-induced subretinal fibrosis in C57BL/6j mice, spontaneous lesion in very low–density lipoprotein
receptor deficient (Vldlr-/-) mice and RPE layer of nAMD patients. Furthermore, I have also observed that the
area of subretinal fibrosis is markedly decreased in Pfkfb3+/- mice. My in vitro studies have shown that PFKFB3
knockdown in RPE cells inhibits their transition to mesenchymal and reduces their production of proinflammatory
and profibrotic factors. I hypothesize that PFKFB3-mediated glycolysis in RPE cells induces their transition to
mesenchymal cells and their production of profibrotic and proinflammatory factors by activating HIFs pathways,
eventually leading to the development of subretinal fibrosis. To test my hypothesis, I have generated RPE-
specific Pfkfb3-deficient mice and established mouse subretinal fibrosis models with laser-induced CNV and
spontaneous CNV in Vldlr-/- mice. I will investigate the effect of Pfkfb3 deficiency in RPE cells on subretinal
fibrosis using specific genetic tools with an integrated approach of in vivo and in vitro models. My study will define
the role of PFKFB3-mediated metabolism in RPE cells in the development of subretinal fibrosis and demonstrate
PFKFB3 inhibition as a novel strategy for the treatment of subretinal fibrosis."
10739405,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Given that a large proportion of cancers are detected at a late stage in India, approaches to increase
screening uptake could have a significant impact on cancer outcomes. There is low level of awareness of
cancer risk factors, symptoms, and importance of screening for early detection of cancers among individuals
in the community. Additionally, there is limited cancer screening knowledge and capacity among primary
care providers, who often have competing priorities leaving limited time to focus on cancer screening. Mobile
Health (mHealth)-based education can serve as a powerful tool for offering e-learning opportunities on
cancer screening and can provide the connectivity required to link community and health care settings, as
mobile technology is widely available and inexpensive. First, we will develop an innovative mHealth platform,
the Integrated Cancer Awareness Network (ICAN), which will apply theory-driven concepts to educate
individuals eligible for colorectal, breast, or cervical cancer screening (referred to as “patients”) and health
care providers through apps accessed on their own mobile devices. ICAN will connect patients and providers
with screening support staff at tertiary medical colleges who will provide coordination and navigation via an
interactive dashboard. Second, we will use implementation science methods to evaluate the effectiveness,
processes, and cost-effectiveness of the ICAN mHealth platform. We propose the following aims:
R21-1. Develop ICAN mHealth platform to educate primary care providers and patients on cancer risk
factors, symptoms, screening tests, and benefits of early detection via apps and create dashboard for hubs.
R21-2. Perform quality and usability assessment with key stakeholders, including providers, patients, and
hub staff to evaluate the ease of use, informational content, perceived usefulness, and interface agility.
R21-3. Conduct a pilot study to evaluate and finalize the ICAN multicomponent intervention platform.
R33-1. Conduct a cluster randomized trial to assess the impact of the ICAN mHealth multicomponent
intervention platform on cancer screening uptake compared to an education app offered only to providers.
R33-2. Use a mixed-methods approach to compare implementation outcomes of the two strategies used in
the trial, including accessibility, usability, acceptability, feasibility, affordability, fidelity, and sustainability.
R33-3. Perform economic evaluations to assess cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment scenarios of
the ICAN mHealth platform compared to provider education app alone.
 This study will provide data-driven evidence on the utility of mHealth multicomponent interventions in
creating an interconnected infrastructure to offer organized population-based screening to increase uptake of
cancer screening. The state and central governments in India can use the new evidence generated to design
optimal approaches to scale up the implementation of cancer screening recommendations. The lesson
learned can be applied to other limited-resource settings."
10922801,"Project Summary/Abstract
The prevalence of dementia continues to rise as the elderly population is growing across the world, especially in
the Latin America population. Identifying modifiable factors that can be the targets for preventing or delaying
dementia and its adverse impacts on life quality is of great relevance to public health. Almost all
biological/physiological processes such as sleep and physical activity levels are modulated by the circadian
system and display orchestrated circadian rhythms in sync with the day-night and sleep-wake cycles. There is
an established foundation as well as overwhelming epidemiological evidence for adverse health consequences
of disrupted circadian rhythms such as sleep disorders, cardiometabolic disease and cognitive impairment.
However, previous circadian studies were mainly performed in high-income countries such as the US and
Europe, and circadian health and its link to dementia in Latin America are unknown. The goal of this project is to
determine the involvement of circadian disturbance in the characterization of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in Latinos. To achieve this goal, PIs and their team will utilize the
existing the database of ReDLat (Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia Research in Latin America), in
which over 3,000 Latinos in three groups of participants (AD, FTLD, and controls) aged between 40 and 80 years
old have been enrolled and underwent or will undergo a multidimensional assessment including social
determinants of health (SDH), socioeconomic status (SES), neurocognition, multimodal neuroimaging, and
whole-genome sequencing. In this project, the ambulatory motor activity recordings (actigraphy) will be collected
from a subset of ReDLat participants and used to quantify daily activity rhythmicity and fractal motor activity
patterns that provide complementary assessment of the multiscale regulatory function of the circadian system.
Using these circadian measures together with clinical assessment, diagnosis, cognition, genetics, three aims will
be addressed: (Aim 1) Determine the effects of age, sex and SDH/SES on circadian disturbance in Latinos; (Aim
2) establish the links between circadian disturbance, dementia, and cognitive function in Latinos; and
(Exploratory Aim 3) Explore the genetic contribution to the link between circadian disturbance and
cognition/dementia in Latinos. Achieving the aims will potentially establish a novel framework to identify the
circadian disturbance features in AD and FTLD in Latin America, and will offer a large, curated, multimodal
dataset for future research. The results to be obtained not only are scientifically important but also may reveal a
potential target (i.e., circadian health) for prevention and/or treatment of dementia and related adverse
complications."
10896267,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cutaneous vasculature is a crucial yet understudied component of the skin, responsible for essential
functions such as tissue oxygenation, exchange of nutrients and soluble factors, and temperature control.
While we have a significant understanding of vascular abnormalities present in various skin pathologies, we
lack an understanding of both physiological remodeling and homeostatic mechanisms sustaining lifelong
function. Specifically, we lack the resolution of the coordinated cellular behaviors that drive developmental
vascular remodeling, as well as those that underlie vascular regeneration in the face of injury, particularly in the
context of hemodynamic status. I hypothesize that network-wide coordination of EC behaviors in relation
to hemodynamic changes regulates developmental and regenerative remodeling programs of the skin
vasculature. To test this hypothesis, I have established an intravital imaging technique that allows for the
longitudinal tracking and manipulation of the endothelial cells (ECs) that constitute the lining of all blood
vessels in the skin of a live mouse.
In Aim 1, I will investigate the neonatal vessel remodeling program and underlying EC behaviors that
orchestrate the establishment of skin vascular network architecture and blood flow efficiency. Following
establishment of adult vascular homeostasis, I will probe the cellular mechanisms that regulate the
maintenance of adult vessel integrity via a targeted laser ablation approach, modeling the discrete membrane
damage inflicted upon the endothelium due to shear and contractile forces. My preliminary data shows that EC
migration within existing vessel structures is a critical EC behavior that underlies network-wide vessel
regression during neonatal remodeling, as well as the reparative response of adult ECs to local damage. In
Aim 2, I will transition my studies towards the understanding of the skin vasculature in the context of
pathological states. Firstly, I will investigate the wound vascularization mechanisms of neonatal versus adult
skin, and delineate the differential remodeling properties that enable the enhanced wound revascularization in
neonatal skin that we have observed in preliminary experiments. Second, I will determine how coordination of
flow-dependent EC rearrangement impacts the ability of adult wounds to revascularize via a genetic mutant
model that uncouples the ability of ECs to polarize with respect to blood flow direction. To achieve these aims,
I will use an integrated approach of cutting-edge imaging technology, transcriptomics, and genetic mouse
models. This research is significant because we expect to uncover global cellular and molecular mechanisms
that coordinate vascular development, homeostasis, and injury repair. My findings will likely drive innovation in
related fields, given the ubiquity and crucial roles of the vasculature in all organs."
10932377,"Genome editing holds great promise for the treatment of many genetic diseases; however its application in the
clinic has been slow due to the lack of the safe delivery tools and significant cost and time investment required
to custom-develop individual therapies. In our SCGE program phase 1 study, we developed a chemically
modified ribonucleoprotein (cRNP)-based gene delivery system that specifically targets neuronal cells
throughout the brain after intrathecal (IT) administration. The overarching goal of this application is to apply this
novel gene editing technology towards the treatment of two severe neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD):
Angelman syndrome (AS) and H1-4 syndrome (HIST1H1E syndrome). AS is a devastating neurodevelopmental
disease caused by the deficiency of the maternal and brain specific imprinting UBE3A gene in human
chromosome 15q11-q13 region. The structure of UBE3A is intact in the paternal chromosome in all AS cases
but transcriptionally repressed by a non-coding and antisense RNA of UBE3A (UBE3A-ATS) mediated
mechanism. It has been shown convincingly that reduction of UBE3A-ATS by antisense oligo (ASO),
topoisomerase inhibitors, and virus delivered Cas9 gene editing can de-repress the expression of UBE3A and
correct the abnormal neurological phenotypes in AS mouse models. H1-4 syndrome is caused by a gain of
function mechanism due to a mutated protein with aberrant C-terminal frameshift tail (CFT). H1-4 syndrome has
similar but milder clinical features than AS. There is no effective intervention for H1-4 syndrome. Thus, a long-
term molecular therapy for AS and H1-4, as well as other NDDs is urgently needed. In our preclinical study using
a well validated AS mouse model, we demonstrated that a single IT delivery of Ube3a antisense-targeting
RNP/Cas9efficiently de-represses the expression of Ube3a from the paternal chromosome, leading to correction
of neurobehavioral phenotypes. Similarly, the knockdown of H1-4 CFT rescue the abnormal phenotypes in H1-
4 humanized mice. We propose our cRNP-based platform for the treatment of AS and H1-4 syndrome utilizing
the same genome editor (CRISPR), delivery system (cRNPs), route (IT), target cell type (neurons), therapeutic
mechanism (genetic inactivation) and overall trial design. We have assembled an outstanding team from Yale
and Rush University with strong and complementary expertise in the areas of preclinical, IND enabling studies,
and clinical trials. The success of this study will lead to the first ever gene editing based therapy for AS and H1-
4. More importantly, it will support a paradigm shift for genome editing; rapidly expanding the number of
neurogenetic diseases treated by in vivo gene editing and accelerating the transition of genome editing
technology into clinical applications."
10913567,"Project Summary/Abstract
We will develop and externally validate electronic health record (EHR)-based prognostic indices to improve
healthcare quality for hospitalized older adults by identifying patients most likely to qualify for (and benefit from)
specific health services. Our indices will predict: 1) 6-month mortality to guide hospice referral decisions; and
2) 2-year mortality to guide outpatient palliative care referrals and inform medication deprescribing. We will
develop each of these indices for patients with and without Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, since
previous studies suggest that the trajectory of decline differs between older adults with and without Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias. Function is critically important to prediction in older adults, particularly those
with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and we have shown that the prognostic power of function
increases with age. A major limitation that has hindered the effectiveness of predictive indices for hospitalized
older adults has been the lack of functional data in the EHR. Recently, recognizing the critical role of function in
providing high quality healthcare to older adults, hospital systems have started to routinely assess and
document functional status. This development facilitates our proposal since we now have access to routine
functional data from several hospitals, allowing us to incorporate these data into prognostic indices. With EHRs
becoming ubiquitous in healthcare systems, our externally validated indices could be integrated into the EHR
in most hospitals. To facilitate use in hospitals without EHR integration, we will develop parsimonious indices
(also for ADRD and non-ADRD patients) available on ePrognosis, our free and widely used online
compendium of geriatric prediction indices. We will set a new standard for equity-conscious prognostic model
building by “baking equity” into model selection and incorporating neighborhood disadvantage as predictor
representing social determinants of health. We have established a 4 site Collaboratory, which all routinely
collect physical function data, clinical diagnoses, standardized delirium assessments, laboratory values, and
physiologic measures: UCSF & Cleveland Clinic (development cohort); and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center & Johns Hopkins (external validation cohort). We propose to: (1) Develop full prognostic indices
designed to be embedded in EHRs for 6-month and 2-year mortality for hospitalized older adults with and
without Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; (2) Develop parsimonious web-based prognostic indices
designed to be accessed through ePrognosis for 6-month and 2-year mortality for older adults with and without
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias; (3) To internally validate the effectiveness of these prognostic
indices; and (4) to externally validate these indices. These indices will help clinicians improve healthcare
quality for older adults by prompting alignment of patient prognosis with health services (i.e. hospice and
palliative care referrals) and deprescribing decisions."

This K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jennifer Head, an Epidemiologist in the Division of
Environmental Health Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. The candidate’s goal is to become a
leader in the development and application of mathematical and statistical approaches to understand the
transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases. This application proposes linked career development
and research activities to fill an important gap in understanding population immunity to coccidioidomycosis, an
emerging infectious disease caused by inhalation of soil-dwelling Coccidioides spores. While CDC estimates
nearly 150,000 cases of coccidioidomycosis go uncounted each year, direct methods for estimating population
immunity for coccidioidomycosis are unavailable. Absent estimates of prior immunity for coccidioidomycosis,
we are unable to identify populations experiencing higher rates of under-reporting, understand the role of low
population immunity in the emergence of the disease in new regions, nor explain disparities in infection risk
and case severity. This project aims to advance the candidate’s expertise and skills in computational methods
for robustly estimating prior immunity in populations and incorporating population immunity into models
examining key drivers of disease. The candidate will develop a quantitative Bayesian framework for estimating
prior immunity to coccidioidomycosis by geographic region in California (Aim 1). The candidate will extend the
framework to identify disparities in under-reporting by race and ethnicity, yielding a more accurate assessment
of disparities in disease incidence (Aim 2). Estimates of population immunity will be integrated into a statistical
framework capable of estimating key risk factors for infection in the presence of mobile immune and non-
immune populations (Aim 3). Through partnership with California Department of Public Health, the work will
leverage patient data on >94,000 geolocated cases reported since 2000. The 5-year training plan includes
primary mentorship from three experienced and committed faculty mentors at UC Berkeley with expertise in
biostatistics, infectious disease epidemiology and disease dynamics. Four additional mentors—top leaders in
fungal biology, immunology, demography, and social epidemiology—will support the candidate. Leadership of
the proposed research, along with a training plan involving coursework, and mentored grant writing and project
management, will advance the candidate’s training objectives to: 1) build skills in assessing the role of
population immunity in disease transmission; 2) develop expertise in measuring and integrating social factors
into transmission models; 3) develop skills to overcome computational barriers when working with large
datasets; and 4) strengthen collaborative partnerships and build leadership skills for directing transdisciplinary
research projects. UC Berkeley’s commitment to early career scientists; leadership in epidemiology,
biostatistics, and fungal biology; strong track record of research in infectious diseases; and close partnerships
with public health agencies will provide the candidate an outstanding environment to advance her career goals."
10883685,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the top five deadliest cancers due to a lack of effective
treatment options. One hallmark of PDAC is the expansion of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs play
critical and complex roles in PDAC microenvironment to modulate tumor progression and therapeutic response.
The long-term objective of my research program is to determine the cellular origin, heterogeneity and function of
CAFs in pancreatic cancer. To identify the tissue origin of CAFs in PDAC, I performed lineage tracing
experiments using genetically engineered mouse models. The splanchnic mesenchyme is a particular type of
mesenchyme adjacent to the pancreatic epithelium during fetal development. My studies demonstrated that the
splanchnic mesenchyme is the fetal origin of CAFs in PDAC (Han et al, Nat Commun, in press). In this current
proposal, I aim to further investigate whether splanchnic-derived CAFs maintain certain molecular signatures of
their fetal progenitors. The Hedgehog pathway is a critical paracrine signal between the epithelium and
mesenchyme during fetal development and is reactivated during tumorigenesis of the pancreas. The Hedgehog
signal modulates PDAC progression, but its downstream targets in CAFs have not been identified. My graduate
study showed that transcription factors FOXF1 and GATA6 are downstream targets of the Hedgehog pathway
in the fetal splanchnic mesenchyme. My preliminary studies suggested that these factors are also expressed in
PDAC CAFs in a regionally distinct pattern within the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 1, I will determine whether
FOXF1/GATA6 patterning in CAFs is regulated by the Hedgehog pathway activity. Hedgehog agonist or
antagonist will be utilized in in vitro cell or organoid culture and in vivo mouse models. In Aim 2, I will determine
the function of FOXF1+ CAFs and GATA6+ CAFs in PDAC by deleting these genes specifically in CAFs both in
vitro and in vivo as well as in patient correlation studies. The completion of this study will provide critical insights
in PDAC CAF biology, including novel cellular heterogeneity defined by selective persistence of fetal signatures
in coordination with the epithelium, and certain fetal signatures playing tumor-suppressing roles in a non-cell
autonomous manner. Ultimately, such knowledge in tumor microenvironment may reveal critical targets and
therapeutic avenues to inhibit tumor progression and prolong PDAC patient survival. I received rigorous training
in developmental biology during my graduate study. Four years ago, I started my training in cancer biology as a
postdoctoral fellow in the Hollings Cancer Center. During the K99 phase, I aim to further enhance my expertise
in pancreatic cancer research and to acquire several additional skills, which are essential to launch my
independent research program during the R00 phase. I aspire to draw from paradigms in both embryology and
oncology to develop novel perspectives and to tackle fundamental biological questions."
11160063,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal disease characterized by the dysfunction and death of motor
neurons. Some ALS patients develop widespread neuronal damage leading to Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD),
which is characterized by progressive behavioral change and language decline. Significant overlap exists
between ALS and FTD regarding the genetic causes, suggesting that they may share common pathogenic
mechanisms. Recently, mutations in motor protein, KIF5A, were identified in patients with ALS, ALS/FTD, and
FTD alone. These concentrate in the splicing regulatory sites flanking exon 27 leading to its exclusion and
abnormal KIF5A C-terminal domain structure. Our preliminary findings suggest that KIF5A ALS/FTD mutations
result in the production of a constitutively active protein that causes disease through toxic gain of function. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that KIF5A ALS/FTD is caused by gain of function of KIF5A activity in axonal
transport and cytoskeletal regulation. To ensure that our work will be highly disease relevant we will utilize human
iPSC derived motor neurons and mouse models harboring KIF5A ALS/FTD mutation. In Aim 1: we will define
the effects of KIF5A ALS mutations on the assembly and motility of motor/cargo complexes. Specifically, we will
utilize live-cell imaging of cargo motility, assessment of cargo distribution by IHC and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), candidate-based biochemical assessment of interactions with cargo adaptors, and unbiased
assessment of interactions with potentially novel cargo adaptors and regulatory proteins using proximity labelling.
In Aim 2: we will characterize the effects of KIF5A ALS/FTD mutation on cytoskeletal structure using IHC and
TEM, live-imaging of MT dynamics and sliding, and analysis of MT post-translational modifications. In Aim 3: we
will develop a mouse model of KIF5A ALS/FTD and perform analysis of longevity, behavior, and pathology. The
mouse model will be an invaluable resource to validate findings from our in vitro studies and to advance
knowledge regarding key features of neurodegeneration in KIF5A ALS/FTD. My ultimate goal is to become a
successful physician-scientist with an independent research program investigating the mechanisms of
neurodegeneration in motor neuron disease with a specific focus on axonal transport and cytoskeletal dynamics.
Northwestern University has unique strengths in the study of ALS, FTD, and cytoskeletal biology and an
outstanding commitment to the development of physician-scientists. The mentorship team includes renowned
scientists with strong records in mentorship including Han-Xiang Deng M.D., Ph.D. (Primary Mentor) and Robert
Kalb M.D (co-mentor). The career development plan focuses on broadening the awardee’s portfolio of research
publications and presentations, which will be necessary for successful competition for RO1 funding. Career
development activities will bolster grantsmanship and manuscript preparation skills and provide extensive
didactic training in advanced imaging techniques, proteomics, cytoskeletal biology and ALS/FTD degenerative
mechanisms."
10870056,"Polarized epithelial tubes are critical for an intact kidney. They control water, electrolyte, and nutrient
homeostasis, all of which are deranged in chronic kidney disease. These specialized epithelia require a highly
organized actin cytoskeleton that determines cellular shape and function. During renal epithelial repair, the actin
cytoskeleton of proliferating cells is rapidly re-organized to form the complex polarized architecture of an
epithelial tube. The small Rho GTPase Rac1 is a multifunctional molecular switch and a master regulator of the
actin cytoskeleton. We recently demonstrated that Rac1 is required to maintain actin cytoskeletal integrity,
epithelial polarity, and cell shape of the mature collecting duct (CD) epithelium. It is still unknown how the actin
cytoskeleton is regulated in epithelial cell repair and what role Rac1 plays in this process. For coordinated
epithelial tube regeneration, epithelial cells need to rapidly progress through the cell cycle and divide in the
correct direction along the tissue plane by undergoing oriented mitosis. A critical step in renal epithelial repair is
the activation of the master mitotic kinase cyclin B–CDK1 complex which drives the G2/M transition and prepares
the actin cytoskeleton for mitosis. Undergoing mitosis correctly in a confined tight epithelial space is a challenging
process, which requires the cells to round up against their neighbors. This so-called mitotic rounding depends
on the actin cytoskeleton forming a dense contractile actomyosin cortex, which is tethered to the cell membrane
by ERM Proteins (Ezrin), a known target of Rac1 and its main effector p21-activated kinase (Pak1). Defects in
mitotic morphology lead to cell cycle delays, mechanical defects, and cell death and abnormal repair. How actin
cytoskeletal dynamics are molecularly coordinated and by what means cell shape is connected to cell cycle
control during these critical biological processes in kidney repair is not known. We deleted Rac1 in the collecting
duct (AQP2Cre) or proximal tubule (γGTCre) and performed reversible unilateral ureteric obstruction (R-UUO)
or ischemia-reperfusion induced acute kidney injury (AKI-IRI). Functional and histological assessment indicated
that Rac1 is required for repair in both models. Optical clearing and 3D high-resolution imaging revealed that the
mutant epithelium was unable to restore normal morphology and actin organization post-injury. Repair in Rac1
mutants showed defects in actin-dependent mitotic morphology, misplaced mitotic figures, and the inability to
proliferate due to a G2/M cell cycle defect. 3D high-resolution live imaging of cell division in vitro revealed that
Rac1 is required for normal mechanical progression of mitosis and Ezrin-associated mitotic rounding in renal
epithelial cells. This forms the basis for our hypothesis that Rac1 controlled actin-dependent mitotic rounding
mediated via its effector Pak1 and the linker protein Ezrin is required to promote cell cycling during
tissue repair, which will be tested in the following aims. Aim 1: Define the mechanisms whereby Rac1
regulates renal epithelial repair in vivo. Aim 2: Define the mechanism whereby Rac1 controls renal
epithelial mitotic morphology in vitro."

This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide the candidate, Sehun Oh, PhD., with
protected time and resources to facilitate his transition to research independence in substance use and

including overdose (OD) deaths, in communities with declining economic opportunities (especially in the
Appalachian and Rust Belt areas), we do not have firm theoretical and empirical evidence to explain how local
labor market contexts may affect substance use (SU) and development of substance use disorder (SUD) and

background in economics, substance use epidemiology, and social policy, the candidate will engage in structured
training and research activities to acquire substantive and methodological expertise to elucidate the role of local
labor market contexts in SU/SUD/OD. Specifically, the proposed career development plan is designed to achieve
three training goals: (1) deepening the candidate’s understanding of local economic contexts (especially the
types and qualities of available jobs) as a key etiology of substance use problems and its socioeconomic,
physical, and behavioral health mechanisms; (2) developing expertise in agent-based modeling and supporting
methods (causal inference and spatial analysis) for local SU/SUD/OD projections; and (3) gain hands-on
experiences in research translation and dissemination to inform prevention policy development. A series of
training activities have been carefully designed, including coursework in epidemiology, public policy,
developmental economics and social work; individualized instruction; mentored training; and research
collaborations over five years. This training also will be achieved by conducting a minimum of three research
studies that address the following aims: (1) elucidating the role of the local labor market (re)structuring in SU/SUD
among individuals in young/middle adulthood, (2) developing agent-based models to make SU/SUD/OD
projections in Ohio until 2030 and to conduct policy experiments to assess the preventive effects of employment
and substance supply-related interventions. To address these aims, the candidate will integrate and analyze
various administrative and survey data (related to local labor market contexts, SU/SUD/OD, and other
environmental characteristics); test the effects of industry-specific job availability (and its changes) and
socioeconomic/physical/behavioral health mediators on SU/SUD/OD; develop agent-based modeling to make
robust projections in Ohio based on local labor market outlook; and conduct simulated experiments to assess
the preventive impacts of employment- and substance supply-related policies using agent-based models. By the
end of the award period, the candidate will be positioned as one of the few investigators in the United States
with the requisite knowledge and skills to use systems science and simulation modeling to inform substance use
prevention policies, especially for communities experiencing economic restructuring and/or contractions."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Kidney stone disease is common, affecting 11% of the US population. However, the
pathogenesis of kidney stones is still not well understood. While 10% of stones are known to be
infectious, calcium-based stones, which make up 80% of stones, have not previously been shown
to associate with bacteria. However, recent publications have utilized next-generation sequencing
to demonstrate bacterial infestation in calcium stones despite no evidence of prior or concurrent
urinary tract infection in those patients. In preliminary work, we found that uropathogenic bacteria
trigger increased calcium oxalate crystal growth compared to controls. We hypothesize that
bacteria interact with calcium stones and promote the propagation of kidney stones. We further
propose that this interaction involves the formation of bacterial biofilm.
We will test these hypotheses using three specific aims:
1) To test the hypothesis that uropathogens initiate biofilm formation in stones
2) To test the hypothesis that known surface sensing pathways of Pseudomonas spp. and E coli
trigger kidney stone formation and
3) To test the hypothesis that bacteria play an important role in triggering crystallization and
crystal aggregation in urine-specific environments using an in vitro three-dimensional kidney
model.
These aims will be accomplished by utilizing multiple imaging and complementary techniques
including Raman spectroscopy and x-ray fluorescence as well as single-cell tracking analyses
and molecular genetic techniques to investigate biofilm initiation.
This study will provide new insights into the role of bacteria in the propagation of calcium-based
kidney stones. It will also facilitate the advancement of my independent biomedical researcher
career. I will collaborate with and obtain guidance and tutelage from highly successful,
experienced mentors who are committed to my professional development. My research
capabilities will be augmented by didactic and hands-on training in microbiology, machine
learning, and high-resolution imaging, thus preparing me with the tools necessary to transition to
full independence as a surgeon-scientist. Lastly, this funding will allow me to contribute to
elucidating the etiology of nephrolithiasis and will directly enable provide the preliminary data for
my first R01 application."

computational methodologies is critically needed to identify candidate molecular drivers in PAH lungs as potential
therapeutic targets. With access to RNA sequencing of the largest biobank of human PAH and control lungs to
date (n=148), we have identified, by co-expression network analysis, a module of 266 genes (which we refer to
as the “pink” module) that is strongly associated with PAH lungs. Through multimodal integration with right heart
catheterization data, histological analyses, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we found the pink
module is not only transcriptionally upregulated in PAH lungs, but also associated with increased hemodynamic
severity, vascular remodeling, and genetic risk of PAH. Our preliminary data suggests pink module genes are 1)
dysregulated in pulmonary vascular cells, 2) enriched in pathways relevant to pulmonary vascular remodeling
such as endothelial-mesenchymal transition and Wnt signaling, 3) and may be candidate molecular drivers of
PAH, such as ANTXR1, an integrin-like glycoprotein strongly implicated in various cancers but never studied in
PAH. Given the mounting preliminary evidence for the importance of the bulk lung-derived pink module, a deeper
investigation into its cell-specific role in PAH pathogenesis is needed to advance our understanding of the
molecular drivers of PAH lungs and identify new therapeutic targets. We hypothesize that the pink module drives
vascular remodeling in PAH through its dysregulation within pulmonary vascular cells. To test this hypothesis,
we will 1) resolve the specific cellular context in which the pink module is dysregulated in PAH lungs using single-
nucleus RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics and 2) determine the effects of in vitro knockdown of a pink module
candidate driver gene, such as ANTXR1, in PAH pulmonary vascular cells. The proposed studies will utilize a
combination of cutting-edge multiomic approaches and experimental biology to provide greater insight into a
novel PAH-associated gene set derived from a large lung biobank, and will provide a foundation for my own lab
and future R01 that will focus on basic mechanistic and translational studies."
10916487,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term objective of this study is to develop gene therapies that treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
cardiomyopathy. DMD cardiomyopathy, characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and thinning of the
ventricular wall, ultimately leads to heart failure. Pathogenic features of DMD cardiomyocytes include contractile
dysfunction, poor calcium handling, elevated reactive oxygen species, telomere shortening, and premature cell
death. When a large number of cells die in the heart, scar tissue forms, increasing the stiffness of the heart.
Although there are treatments available to alleviate symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy, there are currently no
therapies to prevent or delay the onset of this disease. Smaller versions of dystrophin amenable to gene therapy
have shown promise to treat DMD-associated severe skeletal muscle wasting; however, surprisingly little is
known about their effects in treating heart failure. This research plan will leverage bioengineered hydrogels of
tunable stiffness, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with dystrophin mutations, and biochemical
techniques to determine if full-length dystrophin can rescue DMD cardiomyocytes from their pathogenic demise.
During the K01 award period, Dr. Asuka Eguchi will train under the mentorship of Dr. Helen Blau, an expert on
DMD. By engineering hydrogels that mimic stiff, diseased heart tissue, Dr. Eguchi will be able to measure
parameters of contraction in cardiomyocytes differentiated from DMD iPSCs. Aim 1 will test if full-length
dystrophin can rescue DMD cardiomyocytes from contractile deficits, aberrant calcium handling, and premature
cell death. Aim 2 will determine if split vector or lipid nanoparticle approaches can deliver full-length dystrophin
to cardiomyocytes. Aim 3 will test whether this gene therapy strategy to deliver full-length dystrophin can delay
the onset of DMD cardiomyopathy in a mouse model. Gene therapy approaches targeting the root cause of
disease, the lack of dystrophin, is critical for extending lifespan and improving the quality of life of DMD patients.
The career development plan is designed to enable Dr. Eguchi to successfully transition to a career as
independent investigator. Her scientific advisory committee consist of Dr. Beth Pruitt, a bioengineer with
expertise in traction force microscopy, Dr. Joseph Wu, an expert on cardiovascular disease modeling, and Dr.
Daniel Bernstein, a pediatric cardiologist. Collectively, these collaborators will help Dr. Eguchi develop skills at
the interface of bioengineering, cell biology, and biochemistry to launch an independent research program in
cardiovascular research."
10896244,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Methamphetamine is a highly addictive drug that has major effects on the brain’s learning and memory
systems. Methamphetamine use is commonly predicted by high use of legal psychostimulants such nicotine or
alcohol, but the mechanisms underlying sequential use of alcohol, nicotine and methamphetamine are not well
understood. Both nicotine and alcohol alter the function of brain circuits required for adaptive decisions, but the
cellular and molecular mechanisms through which this occurs largely remain a mystery. Identifying the gene
regulatory networks within select circuits in high alcohol or high nicotine seeking animals and deciphering how
methamphetamine alters these networks is necessary to decode the fundamental molecular underpinnings
through which methamphetamine influences maladaptive choice. However, the diversity of circuits and cells
involved in these responses has confounded our ability to identify key molecular pathways. Our goal is to use a
genes-circuits-behavior approach in Drosophila melanogaster to provide an innovative and holistic
understanding of the core fundamental principles through which sequential use of psychostimulants alter the
molecular landscape and neural dynamics of memory circuits to alter behavioral decisions. Transcriptional
regulation within memory circuits is a fundamental process through which psychostimulants drive maladaptive
changes in the brain function. This work provides the causal gene regulatory mechanisms through which high
preference for alcohol or nicotine affects methamphetamine response in memory circuits. This has major
implications for how co-use of psychostimulants alters the molecular landscape that drives drug-seeking
behavior."
10920493,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trauma is the leading cause of death worldwide for people under 45 years old, and hemorrhagic shock
remains the primary cause of early death after trauma. Later trauma deaths are frequently attributable to
endotheliopathy of trauma (EOT), a systemic response to activated endothelial cells characterized by impaired
blood flow, barrier integrity, and coagulation. Clinically, EOT manifests as a pro-inflammatory state of
microcirculation leak and tissue edema, contributing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-
organ dysfunction, and, eventually, death. Fibrinogen replacement restores the endothelial glycocalyx in vitro
and in mice via stabilization of syndecan-1, a glycocalyx-based proteoglycan. Fibrinogen stabilization of
syndecan-1 then mitigates EOT and restores microcirculation barrier integrity. However, it is unclear if
fibrinogen-based restoration of endothelial integrity translates to improved clinical outcomes in humans.
Further, current transfusion protocols in trauma provide fibrinogen too little or too late. This is a problem
because trauma patients who develop EOT are twice as likely to die than those who do not. Therefore,
restoring endothelial barrier integrity is essential to mitigating late morbidity and mortality in trauma.
Accordingly, there is a critical need to determine the effect of early fibrinogen replacement on endothelial and
organ dysfunction in critically ill trauma patients. Our preliminary data indicate improved patient-centered
outcomes when fibrinogen is replaced within 6 hours of hospital arrival. However, we do not know whether
endothelial restoration was the primary mechanism. To address this gap, we will test our overarching
hypothesis that preserving endothelial function with early fibrinogen replacement will prevent ARDS and multi-
organ dysfunction after trauma. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: 1) determine the
association between early fibrinogen replacement and multi-organ dysfunction; 2) determine the effect of early
fibrinogen replacement on endothelial function; and 3) determine the cumulative effect of endotheliopathy on
supplemental oxygen-free days. To achieve these aims, the candidate, David Douin, MD, will leverage his
background in clinical research and the existing research infrastructure within the emergency medicine, trauma
surgery, and anesthesiology departments. As an anesthesiologist and surgical intensivist, Dr. Douin is uniquely
positioned to accomplish the proposed K23 research and career development aims. His long-term goal is to
become an expert in novel interventions to prevent and treat multi-organ dysfunction and improve outcomes in
critically ill trauma patients. Dr. Douin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors with extensive clinical
and translational research experience and topical expertise in traumatic injury, critical care, clinical trials,
endothelial function, and lung injury to ensure his success in achieving the stated specific aims and career
goals. This proposal will allow Dr. Douin to transition to an independent physician-scientist and prepare him for
future NIH R61/R33 funding and, eventually, NIH UG3/UH3 or R01 funding."
10897029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: Patricia Vega-Fernandez, MD MSc RhMSUS is a pediatric rheumatologist whose overarching career
goal is to improve the outcomes of children affected by autoimmune rheumatologic diseases through a career
as an independent clinician scientist focused on biology-based imaging and clinical research to support the
development of personalized treatment approaches. Dr. Vega-Fernandez, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics
at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), has conducted multiple studies focused on
addressing the feasibility and reliability of musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis
(JIA). The proposed K23 career development plan will focus on identified gaps in Dr. Vega-Fernandez’s
knowledge and training that are essential to advance her career towards an independent investigator: 1) Critical
appraisal of the biological signatures in JIA; 2) Performance of US-guided synovial biopsy in children with JIA;
3) Validation of instruments and longitudinal studies; 4) Strengthened personal, academic, and professional skills
to become an effective independently funded clinical-scientist.
Mentors/Environment: Dr. Vega-Fernandez and her mentors, Hermine Brunner MD MSc MBA, Sherry
Thornton PhD, Jonathan Dillman MD MSc, and Jareen Meinzen-Derr PhD MPH, have assembled a strong team
of advisors and collaborators from inside and outside of CCHMC to guide the proposed training and research
activities. The career development plan utilizes intellectual resources at CCHMC and the University of Cincinnati.
Research: JIA, the most common chronic rheumatic disease in childhood, is characterized by joint inflammation
(arthritis). Diagnosis of arthritis in children is based on the presence of joint swelling and limited range of motion
and/or tenderness on palpation. Given the young age of children at diagnosis, the report of joint pain or limitation
of motion can often times be inaccurate. In addition, clinical assessment of active arthritis in the developing
skeleton is subjective and has low inter-rater reliability. MSUS can objectively inform presence and severity of
joint inflammation. There is a knowledge gap on the clinical significance of MSUS findings in children. The central
hypothesis of this study is that a 10-joint focused MSUS score can serve as a diagnostic imaging tool to provide
an accurate assessment of both clinical and biologic activity of inflammation over time in children with JIA. Guided
by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Determine the convergent
validity of the MSUS-10 score across the spectrum of JIA disease activity; 2) Determine the ability of the MSUS-
10 score to capture clinically relevant change of JIA; 3) Evaluate the relationship of the MSUS-10 score with
biologic markers of JIA inflammation. The proposed experiments are significant because the MSUS-10
examination and score may support safer and more appropriate choices for the treatment of arthritis, which in
turn will improve the outcomes of children with JIA. This project is innovative as this novel approach of using
MSUS scoring may lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment and care that JIA patients receive."
10741790,"Epithelial cells play critical roles in many organs and are responsible for elemental processes such as nutrient
uptake and waste product secretion. To fulfill these functions, they polarize their plasma membrane into apical
and basolateral domains. To maintain tissue homeostasis, epithelial cells must continuously sort newly
synthesized and internalized surface receptors to the correct target domain. And after tissue damage, epithelial
cells must correctly migrate into the wound and re-colonize the wound area. Loss of polarity is associated with
numerous diseases including metastatic cancer, polycystic kidney disease, and Crohn’s disease. How epithelial
cell polarity is regulated is thus an important cell biological question with profound implications for human health.
Our work identified the epithelial cell-specific clathrin adaptor complex AP-1B as crucial for polarized recycling
of cargos to the basolateral domain. Cargos that depend on AP-1B for basolateral localization include important
signaling receptors such as epidermal growth hormone receptor whose missorting to the apical domain has been
implicated in cancer and polycystic kidney disease, and toll-like receptor 3 whose missorting results in chronic
inflammation. A major unresolved question in the field is how AP-1B uniquely functions in epithelial cells, and
why its close cousin AP-1A mostly fails to substitute. Our previous work suggested that AP-1B changes the
organization of recycling endosomes (REs) to accommodate AP-1B’s function in basolateral sorting. Only AP-
1B but not AP-1A localizes in REs where it triggers the formation of a lipid domain enriched in PI(3,4,5)P3, and
facilitates the recruitment of accessory factors including a vesicle-tethering complex (the exocyst) and a lipid
kinase (PIPKIg-90). We recently showed that AP-1B expression reduced the speed of collective cell migration
after monolayer wounding, a novel function independent of basolateral sorting. We will test the central hypothesis
that AP-1B plays dual roles in establishment and maintenance of epithelial monolayers by 1) directing cargos to
the basolateral membrane by generating a sorting platform in REs at steady-state and 2) during cell migration
by modulating the availability of focal adhesion molecules at the plasma membrane. We will test this hypothesis
in our proposed experiments by using state-of-the-art imaging techniques including live TIRF microscopy in
combination with photoactivation and unbiased screens including BioID and mass spectrometry to complement
innovative cell biological and biochemistry approaches to: 1. Determine how AP-1B generates a basolateral
sorting platform, and 2. Determine how AP-1B controls cell migration. Our studies will define new mechanisms
governing the organization of polarized epithelial cells at steady-state and during cell migration."
10865029,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The goal of this K23 award is to give the PI the skills and preliminary data
needed to improve access to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment with buprenorphine among marginalized
individuals via telehealth care. Dr. Aronowitz is proposing a research and career development plan that will
prepare her to become an independent investigator focused on expanding access to OUD treatment and harm
reduction services via innovative care delivery models. OUD continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in the United States. Substantial evidence supports the use of medications for OUD (MOUD) like
buprenorphine; however, 80% of people with OUD receive no treatment; of those who receive treatment, only
a third receive MOUD. Preliminary evidence suggests that a COVID-era policy change allowing for
buprenorphine induction and management via telehealth expanded access. There is little evidence, however,
about how to tailor telehealth models to promote equitable and effective OUD care. Providers may hesitate to
offer MOUD via telehealth to patients they deem “unstable,” even if these patients lack other treatment options.
Given the dearth of accessible treatment options for many individuals, the decision not to offer telehealth may
result in a patient receiving no OUD treatment. Therefore, clinicians need evidence to guide how and to whom
they deliver telehealth OUD treatment. Dr. Aronowitz will develop and test a telehealth model in partnership
with Prevention Point Philadelphia, a harm reduction organization providing MOUD and other services to the
most marginalized people with OUD in the city. The specific aims are to: 1) identify components of an effective
telehealth intervention and barriers to implementation, 2) partner with an advisory board of OUD treatment
stakeholders from different settings to develop a telehealth intervention for OUD treatment with buprenorphine,
and 3) conduct a pilot trial of the telehealth intervention for OUD treatment. The mentorship team brings
together experts in health services research, human-centered design, intervention development, and evidence-
based OUD treatment, and key stakeholder advisors from diverse community settings. This K23 extends Dr.
Aronowitz's experience as a clinician scientist with four training goals: 1) build skills in contextual inquiry and
human-centered design to support effective intervention development; 2) develop expertise in intervention
mapping, community-partnered research with Black and Latino communities, and stakeholder engagement to
inform intervention development, implementation and sustainment; 3) learn how to conduct field trials ethically
and effectively with marginalized populations; and 4) enhance grant-writing skills for transition to
independence. With successful completion of this project and training Dr. Aronowitz will be well-prepared to
lead an independent research agenda dedicated to improving access to care for people who use drugs. This
project is well-aligned with the strategic objectives of NIDA to leverage technology and innovation, reduce
health disparities, and develop models that address the real-world complexities of substance use."
10931565,"The Role of Comprehensive Adult Medicaid Dental Benefit in Improving Oral Health and Reducing
Disparities among Adults and Children
Project Summary
Even though it is well established that oral health is integral to overall health, economic productivity, and well-
being, it remains the most common unmet health need in the US. Low-income and minority groups carry a
significantly high burden of dental disease, highlighting socioeconomic disparities and lack of access to oral
health care. A large proportion of these groups rely on Medicaid, but unlike children, federal law does not
mandate dental coverage for adults, and coverage varies by state leaving many uninsured or underinsured.
Starting July 2021, Virginia expanded dental coverage for all Medicaid-enrolled adults (up to 138% of FPL),
providing access to comprehensive dental care to thousands of adults for the first time. This dental policy
change provides a unique opportunity, a 'natural experiment,' to gain a deeper and clear understanding of the
effect of implementing a comprehensive dental benefit on the oral health of Medicaid enrollees and fill a critical
gap in oral health services research. The purpose of the proposed K08 research project is to evaluate the role
of Virginia's comprehensive adult Medicaid dental policy on dental care utilization and reducing oral health
disparities among the Medicaid population. The project will: 1) examine the demand for dental services among
Medicaid-enrolled adults following the implementation of the dental benefit, 2) evaluate the impact of dental
benefit on the use of the emergency department (ED) for dental visits by comparing adults enrolled in Medicaid
with those having private insurance, and 3) assess the effect of the Medicaid adult dental benefit on children's
dental care use. Data sources will include multi-year claims data from the Virginia Medicaid program and
Virginia All Payers Claims Data that will be linked with the county-level workforce and community data on
social factors from multiple sources. Causal inference methods and advanced econometric and data science
approaches such as difference-in-difference and interrupted time series will be used to isolate the policy's
effect on measured oral health outcomes. The primary goal of this K08 application is to advance the
candidate's (Dr. Naavaal) research career by protecting her time to acquire training in health policy,
econometrics, and data science and gain research experience in applying these methods to conduct rigorous
oral health services and health policy research. This goal will be accomplished through executing proposed
research supported by carefully planned training objectives and intensive career development activities. The
proposed research outcomes will generate the evidence needed to inform strategies to strengthen existing and
new policies, including systems-level changes needed to minimize disparities and maximize oral health gains.
The expertise and guidance of the multi-disciplinary mentoring and advisory teams, in addition to the wealth of
resources and commitment to training provided through the institutional environment, will ensure the success
of the candidate's research project and enable her to establish a robust research program as an independent
research investigator."
10740301,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural racism (SR) is defined as mutually reinforcing systems, such as income, education and housing, that
disadvantage ethnoracially minoritized individuals. SR is increasingly recognized as a fundamental cause of
ethnoracial inequities in health, however, the impact of neighborhood-level SR on substance use risk in
minoritized youth is not known, despite the widespread negative impact that substance use disorders (SUDs)
have on public health. To address this major gap, we plan to characterize the impact of SR, measured as area-
level racial differences in income, education and exposure to violence, on neurocognitive mechanisms of
substance use risk at the brain and behavior levels in two disadvantaged contexts. A Community Advisory Board
will refine our approach and maximize impact of findings. Results will inform structural interventions, the primary
line of prevention for structural inequities. The buffering effect of area- and family-level protective factors, e.g.
percentage of Latine owned businesses, parental monitoring, and individual-level factors, e.g. neurocognition
could also inform secondary lines of structural-, family- and individual level-prevention. In the US, SR developed
from a long history of deliberate exclusion of ethnoracially minoritized individuals from access to wealth and other
opportunities, e.g. education and safe living environments. Thus, high levels of SR indicate an unjust
environment in which larger rewards are purposefully kept out of reach. We have learned from social psychology
that weaker belief in a just world relates to choosing smaller, sooner over larger, later rewards, aka steeper delay
discounting, as this is the optimal strategy in an unjust world. However, when the reward is a substance and
immediate use is chosen over long-term health outcomes, this environmental adaptation could increase
the risk of substance use. During adolescence, delay discounting predicts future use and in childhood,
neighborhood disadvantage relates to reduced grey matter volume in prefrontal brain regions, possibly indexing
environmental shaping. In adulthood, SUDs are associated with steeper delay discounting and decreased task-
related brain activity in prefrontal regions. We will work with the Boricua Youth Study (BYS), an intergenerational,
representatively sampled cohort of Puerto Rican families living in the South Bronx, New York (SBx) and San
Juan, Puerto Rico (PR) that has been followed for 20+ years. We hypothesize that greater neighborhood SR,
measured as a latent factor indexed by racial differences in income and education, and murder rates, will relate
to alterations in adolescent neural structure and delay discounting related function (R61; n=36 in SBx;
n=36 in PR), weaker belief in a just world, and thus increase substance use risk in minoritized youth (R33;
n=80 in SBx; n=80 in PR). Neighborhood- and family-level protective factors will buffer the impact of SR
on neural outcomes (R33). Results will reflect the impact of SR on neurocognitive mechanisms of substance
use risk in minoritized youth, guiding structural-, family- and individual prevention approaches."
10903917,"Project Summary
Sleep is a critical behavioral state that fulfills essential needs for health, including clearing waste products (e.g.,
amyloid beta [Aβ]) from the brain. As humans age, sleep quality strikingly deteriorates, and this decline
correlates with increased risk for neurodegeneration, vascular dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. While the
occurrence of sleep disruption during aging is well documented, the causative impact of sleep on brain
resilience with age and disease remains unexplored. I hypothesize that sleep is a key modulator of animal
health that can be manipulated to improve brain resilience in the context of aging and disease. To investigate
the impact of sleep on brain resilience late in life, I will (Aim 1) characterize if age-associated sleep
deterioration (e.g., circadian timing and amount of sleep) impacts cognitive health, (Aim 2) perturb sleep and
test the impact on cognitive resilience late in life, and (Aim 3) determine if sleep improves brain resilience in the
context of human Aβ1-42 overexpression. The age dependence of sleep deterioration and neurodegeneration
is difficult to study at scale due to the time-consuming challenge of aging vertebrates. To overcome this
challenge and tackle this question, I will use the African killifish, a model with an extremely short lifespan of
only 4-7 months. The killifish exhibits key hallmarks of human aging (e.g., neurodegeneration, frailty) and has
conserved brain structures and genes known to regulate sleep. Critically, killifish brains exhibit increases in
neurofibrillary degeneration, oxidative stress, gliosis, and inflammation, as well as decreases in repair, as they
age. The killifish also possesses practical advantages such as low husbandry costs, a short generation time
(<1 month), and genetic tractability. These traits make the killifish a suitable model system to investigate how
sleep may impact brain resilience with age. In preliminary efforts, I built a longitudinal tracking system to
generate an unprecedented view into how sleep changes across the lifespan, and I found that killifish exhibit
an age-associated sleep decline that parallels human sleep decline. I also genetically perturbed sleep and
identified novel lifespan-extending genes. I used my new CRISPR knockin method to develop the first killifish
model for Alzheimer’s disease. Using these tools and discoveries, I will determine how sleep impacts brain
resilience with age and disease. I am pursuing this project at Stanford University with training from my mentor
Dr. Anne Brunet, co-mentor Dr. Karl Deisseroth, and an exceptional scientific advisory team whose expertise
spans brain aging, Alzheimer’s disease, neurodegeneration, and sleep. Through continued training with the
K99/R00 award, I will learn new methods (killifish genetics, intact whole-mount brain staining, and advanced
transcriptomic/behavioral data analysis) and concepts (the biology of aging, Alzheimer’s disease, protein
aggregation, neurodegeneration). This work, my career development, and my technical training will provide me
with the skills and knowledge required to be a successful leader of a laboratory at a top academic institution."
10932950,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a pressing and costly public health issue with negative lifelong
consequences. Children living in economically disadvantaged families and communities are at high risk for
experiencing CAN or receiving CAN reports. Though not all types of CAN are preventable, theories and
empirical studies suggest policies strengthening economic security may be potentially effective strategies
to prevent a significant portion of CAN by improving caregiving capacity and parental well-being. The
COVID-19 pandemic (hereafter, COVID) has exacerbated economic hardship and parental stress, creating
additional risks related to CAN. To address material hardship and health inequity, states with differing
contexts developed or expanded innovative economic support policies, with various approaches in timing,
policy selection, and implementation. Understanding how COVID-related policy changes impacted CAN is
essential to inform the design of CAN prevention strategies in the COVID-recovery era and plan for future
disasters. Further, central to recovery from COVID (and other similar disasters) is the mobilization of
community resources and collective actions by community members. Although the goal of macro-level
policy evaluation is to improve community-based CAN prevention practices, little effort has been made to
engage local communities in the identification and implementation of community-based policies.
Leveraging a natural experimental design with nationwide data, along with a community-based
participatory design, this study will 1) examine how changes in state-based economic support policies
during and post COVID, individually and in synergy with each other, impact CAN report and related family
stressors; 2) investigate how states' policy effects vary by county poverty rate, racial/ethnic composition,
and rural/urban status; 3) engage families and service providers in how policies are implemented at the
local level with the aim to identify effective CAN prevention strategies in local community settings.
To accomplish the proposed project goals, the PI will receive mentorship from a group of interdisciplinary
experts, including Drs. Melissa Jonson-Reid, Derek Brown, and Patricia Kohl, take full advantage of the
extensive resources at the NIH-funded Center for Innovation in Child Maltreatment Policy, Research and
Training (P50HD096719), and extend existing partnerships with community stakeholders in Missouri. The
PI will receive training in 1) performing policy evaluations with rigorous causal inference methodologies; 2)
managing and analyzing large-scale ecological data; 3) conducting community-based participatory
research; 4) developing NIH grants and disseminating research evidence for CAN prevention. This K01
award will enable the PI to conduct independent, community-engaged, and policy-relevant research
informing states' selection and implementation of policies to prevent CAN."
10877113,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inequities in substance use disorders (SUDs) among American Indian (AI) populations persist despite decades
of awareness and research. Advancements in heretofore separate areas of SUD research have (1)
underscored the importance of community based and culturally grounded research approaches in AI
populations and (2) shown the promise of clinical neuroscience's role in addressing SUD. Merging these
approaches through clinical-cultural neuroscience is a missing link in the field which holds large promise for
advancing both SUD disparities research in AIs and underserved populations, and the neuroscientific
understanding of SUD and recovery more broadly. This proposal integrates Community Based Participatory
Research (CBPR) and clinical-neuroscience approaches to better delineate the brain processes that are
important for SUD and that are impacted by traditional cultural engagement (TCE). The study aims to leverage
the large promise of multimodal neuroimaging techniques as a method for probing TCE using objective
markers of brain structure and function. Conceptualization of TCE will be done in collaboration with partners
from the Shawnee Tribe (ST). This partnership is critical to the current project as culture comprises a broad
category of human experiences common to a group of people and is often conflated with race, ethnicity,
geographic distribution, and religion. This complexity has made it difficult to parse the influence of cultural
factors and meaningfully incorporate TCE into disease and treatment models. Recently, advances in health
disparities research among AI communities have conceptualized features of TCE under the framework of
social determinants of health (SDH) to delineate specific risk and resilience factors for SUD. Furthermore, TCE
has been supported as protective against and as treatment for SUD.
The ST recognizes the impact of historical loss and degradation of cultural practices as a key factor in the
prevalence of SUD and is committed to centering community engagement in developing evidence-based
intervention and prevention efforts informed by and integrating traditional cultural knowledge and practices.
Kipiyeecipsakiciipe “coming home” is a Shawnee word chosen by the ST partners to represent the effort of
advancing the science of TCE in mitigating SUD disparities. A community advisory board of Shawnee adults
will oversee the design, implementation, and interpretation of the study. A three phased approach will be used
to provide a multi-level understanding of TCE as a protective SDH. Phase 1 will consist of focus groups aimed
at refining a conceptualization of TCE specific to the ST to provide deep conceptual validity for behavioral
probes and stimuli for neural probes of TCE. Phase 2 will examine neural probes of TCE and neurobehavioral
and cognitive risk factors for SUD across individuals with varying degrees of TCE as defined by the CAB.
Phase 3 will extend results to a sample of individual with SUD and healthy controls. This study will provide a
framework for studying analogous cultural factor across other racial minority groups to advance health equity."
10906136,"Summary
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with progressive memory loss and
cognitive decline. Early detection is critical for prevention and treatment of AD and AD related dementia
(ADRD). It has been estimated that delay of the onset of dementia by even one year would reduce the
prevalence of dementia by 10%. Recently, increasing evidence demonstrates that AD pathological changes
can occur in sensory associated brain areas 5-10 years early before typical AD symptoms present, suggesting
that they could serve as early biomarkers for AD/ADRD detection and diagnosis. Hearing is an important
neural sense. Hearing loss also is a major high-risk factor for dementia. Recent studies demonstrated that
visual and auditory stimulations with gamma oscillation cycles could reduce amyloid-ȕ (Aȕ expression in the
brain and improve memory in AD mice. We hypothesize that hearing has a critical role in AD development and
progression. However, hearing is an understudied field in AD study. Little is known about AD-induced hearing
changes. Previous epidemiological studies demonstrated that AD patients could have hearing loss. However,
since aged persons usually have age-related hearing loss (ARHL), it was hard to distinguish AD-induced
hearing decline from ARHL in those epidemiological studies. The link to AD pathology also could not be
determined and remained unclear. In this project, we will use AD mouse models to identify and characterize
AD-induced functional and pathological changes in the auditory system (Aim 1). Both familial AD (fAD) and
sporadic AD (sAD) mouse models will be used to increase experimental rigor. AD-induced functional changes
in the auditory system will be longitudinally examined and assessed during AD development and progression.
These changes will be linked to Aȕ and Tau protein expressions and genomic changes in the auditory system,
which will be assessed by RNA sequencing. The AD hearing marker, thus, can be unambiguously determined.
In Aim 2, we will use both AD and ARHL mouse models to further distinguish AD-induced hearing decline from
ARHL. We will also define the impact of hearing loss on AD/ADRD development and progression and test
whether ARHL can accelerate/exacerbate AD/ADRD development and progression. These proposed studies
can improve our understanding AD pathology and the role of hearing in AD/ADRD development and
progression. Such information is also critical and required for understanding the underlying mechanism for the
therapeutic effect of acoustic stimulation against AD and further improving treatment and prevention."
10742926,"ABSTRACT
Hearing loss is highly prevalent but under-addressed, highlighting the need to assure hearing’s place on public
health agendas across the life course (e.g., aging and cognitive decline). There is a paucity of population
research on the social, historical and cultural determinants of health on hearing, and the effects of hearing loss
on physical as well as on psychological and social health. A fuller understanding of these issues may be
advanced using new methodological approaches to address hearing health in the population (for example,
participatory research using co-production research methods involving community stakeholders). Population
Hearing Health Care (PopHHC) is a network of researchers, clinicians, students, and leading advocates in Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for people who live with hearing loss. PopHHC aims to increase the
impact of hearing health care research on global hearing health care in order to prevent hearing loss and to
improve the lives of those who live with hearing loss. Specifically, PopHHC promotes investigations of
individual-level population data using technological advances and data-sharing infrastructures that are
becoming more common. PopHHC aims to consolidate efforts across disciplines and countries so that
converging evidence can be used to promote what is known, identify gaps in knowledge, and unify resources
that can be shared to build a strong evidence base. The overarching goal of PopHHC is to facilitate growth in
the breadth and impact of interdisciplinary work in population health research related to hearing. This goal will
be accomplished through the proposed series of conferences that will provide an opportunity to exchange the
latest research and models, broaden networks and interdisciplinary collaborations, and facilitate the
recruitment and training of the next generation of diverse and dynamic researchers. Thus, three specific aims
are: (1) Facilitate building and expanding resources (databases, metrics, tools) so that knowledge transfer is
broadened and deepened among current researchers in population hearing health; (2) Promote inter-
disciplinary research by bringing together experts from areas of population health research other than ear and
hearing care to engage in discussions and activities related to population hearing health where there are
unrealized synergies between hearing health and other domains of health; and (3) Support the development of
future generations of a diverse network of researchers in population hearing, with a targeted effort to
include participants from traditionally un- and under-represented backgrounds."

Recipients of a kidney transplant from an African-American deceased donor have worse outcomes than
their counterparts receiving an organ from a European-American deceased donor. In addition, kidney
transplants from deceased donors with two apolipoprotein L1 gene (APOL1) high-risk genotypes, which is
almost exclusively found in individuals of recent African ancestry, have shorter survival. Some recipients of
these organs, however, have good long-term outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that APOL1 genes
interact with other environmental or inherited factors to cause accelerated failure of kidney transplants.
Similarly, living donors of recent African ancestry face increased risk of post-donation kidney failure
compared to European-American living donors, but the potential impact of APOL1 genotypes in these
donors is unclear. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) established the “APOL1 Long-term Kidney
Transplantation Outcomes” (APOLLO) U01 Consortium in 2017 to prospectively address several questions
regarding APOL1 genotyping in kidney transplantation. The APOLLO Consortium includes a Scientific and
Data Research Center and 13 Clinical Centers, including our University of Wisconsin Clinical Center. In the
proposed APOLLO Phase 2, we will collect extended long-term data on graft function, injury, and survival to
more comprehensively define outcomes associated with donor and recipient APOL1 genetic variants and
continue to recruit new living donors of African ancestry. Working with the SDRC, we will return APOL1
genotype results to enrolled transplant recipients and living donors. The data to be collected will define the
impact of genotypes on graft outcomes and living donors and identify secondary factors that modify
outcomes. These data are critical to improve allograft survival and quality of life for all transplant recipients."
10900605,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection globally, and is causally
linked to cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV-associated cancers have a disproportionate
impact in low-resource settings and nowhere is this evident than in South Africa, which has a uniquely
vulnerable population due to the convergence of the largest HIV epidemic globally, with HPV rates of up to
85% in young women under the age of 25. Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality
among women in South Africa. In 2014, the South African National Department of Health implemented a
national, school-based HPV immunization program. Despite a promising start, vaccine coverage and dose
completion rates dropped precipitously after 2014, with only 37% of girls receiving their first dose in 2021.
Recent declines have been attributed to COVID-related program interruptions, increased medical mistrust, and
vaccine hesitancy related to misinformation spread on social media. There are additional critical gaps in care –
specifically boys who are ineligible for this program, as well as adolescents outside the public school system.
There is an urgent need to identify effective, replicable, and scalable strategies to optimize HPV vaccine
uptake and completion in school-age children. The overall objective of the proposed R34 is to refine and
evaluate a school-based multi-level communications strategy that addresses intrapersonal, interpersonal, and
institutional factors associated with HPV vaccine uptake and completion amongst fifth graders, as part of a pilot
feasibility trial. The proposed study is led by investigators from the United States and South Africa in
partnership with the Department of Health and elementary schools in an urban setting with high burden of HPV
vaccine preventable cancers in KwaZulu Natal, South African. The project builds upon our team’s expertise in
HPV prevention, vaccine decision making, health communications, participatory design, and community
engagement to pursue the following Specific Aims. (1) To refine components of a school-based multi-level
communication strategy to improve HPV vaccine uptake and completion among girls and boys, and (2)
To evaluate preliminary effects of the communications strategy and key criteria to advance to a full-
scale hybrid type 2 trial. Our systems-focused approach leverages established partnerships with area
schools serving diverse populations who are not always effectively served by traditional healthcare channels.
We will ensure health equity is at the core of our research integrating the voices of individuals living in low-
resource settings to understand and reduce the barriers to HPV vaccine initiation and completion. This
proposal is responsive to NCI’s call for cancer prevention and control clinical trials planning grants (PAR-22-
173) both in its active stakeholder engagement, and its focus on engaging a diverse, scientifically appropriate
study population."
10845628,"Therapeutic HIV vaccines confront an immune system whose anti-pathogen responses are established and
have usually been evolving for years. T-cell responses to immunodominant epitopes have been generated
and may have been maintained—or could have forced viral escape and eventual expansion of T cells with
alternative, originally sub-dominant specificities. Many HIV-specific T cells have low proliferative capacity,
rendering them incapable of a robust response when antiretroviral treatment is stopped. Furthermore, the
established T-cell repertoire failed to control acute infection, so expansion of pre-existing T cells with their
attendant functional deficiencies is unlikely to be therapeutically effective.
The primary goal of therapeutic vaccination must instead be expansion of new T-cell clones with superior
function, and/or the restoration of function to pre-existing memory cells. We suggest that only such qualitative
improvements can provide the host with new capacity for control over the virus.
A central objective of our program is to understand the extent to which pre-existing host immune and
metabolic features constrain the quality of T-cell responses to therapeutic vaccination. Which
immunometabolic conditions predict and perhaps foster qualitatively superior responses? What fraction of the
T-cell response to vaccination is represented by new and previously undetected clonotypes, and how do the
functional capacities and differentiation of the new clonotypes differ from pre-existing ones?
A second major objective is to evaluate the relative ability of different vaccine regimens and metabolic
interventions to expand new HIV/SIV-specific T cells with stem-like qualities. We and others have shown
that HIV-specific T cells in natural HIV controllers express high levels of the memory-promoting transcription
factor, TCF-1, retain proliferative capacity, and exhibit metabolic plasticity. We hypothesize that vaccine-
induced cells with stem-like properties often derive from naïve T-cell clonotypes not previously expanded or
chronically exposed to antigen, and that different vaccine regimens differ in their ability to recruit such cells.
A third and central objective of our effort is to learn how peptide specificity, stemness, and metabolic
capacities of T cells responding to vaccination are related to control over viremia during ATI. A large
literature supports our premise that high T-cell quality is required for control over viremia, and more specifically
that T cell memory, or “stemness”, features are associated with effective host responses. However, these
connections remain relatively unexplored in the context of therapeutic vaccination, in part due to scarcity of
large therapeutic-vaccine studies that have yielded an appreciable efficacy signal. We will use samples from
human and non-human primate therapeutic-vaccine studies that have shown evidence for T cell-mediated
virologic suppression to understand if the T-cell features previously linked to control over infection are also
typical of successful immune responses to therapeutic vaccines."
10910157,"Project Summary
Public and private research funders have heavily invested in the application of implantable neurotechnologies to
improve the management of treatment-resistant conditions and loss of function (e.g., deep brain stimulation
(DBS) systems for recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, disorders of consciousness, movement
disorders, and psychiatric disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression). These
devices are trialed with people who have had severe impairments and treatment-resistant disorders for many
years. However, even when some participants show significant symptom relief or gain of function in these trials,
there is no way to systematically ensure post-trial access to beneficial non-FDA approved investigational
therapeutic devices. Loss of access or maintenance of promising neural interventions can cause recurrent
severe, treatment-resistant conditions and distress related to loss of access and the financial difficulties
associated with the costs necessary to support and maintain these devices generally without insurance
coverage. Importantly, the end of the trial is just the beginning of a long readjustment process to life with these
implanted neural devices for participants and care partners. They must renegotiate life roles and expectations
and learn to navigate the world anew with the benefits, demands, and consequences of these emerging
neurotechnologies. The goal of this research is to promote participant well-being and advance neuroscience by
gaining a deeper understanding of participants and their care partners’ trajectory following DBS trials (e.g.,
experience with device access and maintenance, clinical care after the trial, psychosocial support needs to adjust
to a life with the device), while maximizing opportunities for discovery following neural device trials. The aims of
this study are (Aim 1) to examine the perspectives of post-trial participants and care partners from a diversity of
DBS trials regarding their device, clinical, and psychosocial needs. To do this, we will conduct in-depth interviews
with former participants in experimental DBS trials (e.g., TBI, OCD, depression, and Tourette syndrome (TS)),
their care partners, and their local physicians. Interviews will examine their views, needs, and experiences
regarding post-trial device access, clinical care for the DBS indication, adjustment to life post-trial, what kind of
psychosocial support they believe could be helpful, and their attitudes about follow up studies. We will then (Aim
2) conduct in-depth interviews to examine the perspectives of researchers, device manufacturers, health
insurance providers, and key administrative personnel (i.e., representatives of academic medical centers, FDA,
and public and private research sponsors) regarding barriers and opportunities for post-trial device access,
clinical care, psychosocial support, and the scientific implications of extended device access and longitudinal
follow up. Finally, (Aim 3) we will use a modified policy Delphi technique to generate partnerships amongst the
stakeholders to articulate the most pressing challenges and promising solutions to improve post-trial device
access, clinical care, psychosocial support needs, and follow up data collection."
10891693,"SUMMARY
Many cancers carry recurrent, change-of-function mutations affecting RNA splicing factors, resulting in
sequence-specific changes in RNA splicing that promote disease initiation and progression. These
“spliceosomal mutations” are the most common class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and
related hematologic disorders, which have few effective, FDA-approved treatments. Despite the high frequency
of spliceosomal mutations and corresponding need for new therapeutics, there currently exist no therapies that
specifically and selectively target these lesions.
Here, we propose to address this clinical need by creating new precision therapeutics that selectively
kill cells with spliceosomal mutations. Our interdisciplinary team consists of a physician-scientist with expertise
in cancer biology and patient care (Abdel-Wahab), a basic scientist with expertise in RNA splicing and
functional genomics (Bradley), and a bioengineer with expertise in drug delivery (Heller). In preliminary
experiments, we developed the “synthetic intron” technology to harness altered RNA splicing activity
caused by spliceosomal mutations to drive cancer-specific gene expression, showed that synthetic
introns permit highly selective expression of therapeutic payloads in cancer cells while leaving healthy
cells unharmed, and used this system to suppress the growth of diverse cancer types in vivo (North et
al, Nature Biotechnology, 2022). We additionally demonstrated that synthetic introns enable simultaneous and
selective delivery of multiple therapeutic payloads and allow for detailed mechanistic dissection of the cis- and
trans-acting sequence elements and splicing factors that govern pro-tumorigenic mis-splicing caused by
recurrent spliceosomal mutations.
We will now build on these preliminary studies to develop synthetic intron-based therapeutics for
myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(CMML), and additionally utilize synthetic introns to understand the mechanistic basis for aberrant splicing in
these diseases as follows: Aim 1, Dissect and exploit the molecular mechanisms underlying common as well
as allele-specific splicing changes induced by different SF3B1 mutations; Aim 2, Develop synthetic introns that
enable selective therapeutic protein expression for each of the commonly mutated RNA splicing factors in
leukemia; Aim 3, Optimize in vivo delivery and rigorously test an immunostimulatory therapy for treating
SF3B1-mutant hematopoietic malignancies.
The significance of these studies is that they will develop a new
technology that enables mechanistic studies of cancer-associated spliceosomal mutations and also provides a
specific means for therapeutically targeting these mutations. The health relatedness is that the proposed work
will create specific therapeutic products for treating cancer types that currently have few effective, FDA-
approved treatments."
10723404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth have a gender identity different from society's expectations based
off their sex assigned at birth. Stigma, distress with pubertal changes associated with sex assigned at birth, and
societal expectations of gender and beauty, are factors that can affect a TGD youth's relationship with their body,
eating, and exercise. TGD youth are at higher risk of disordered eating behaviors (DEB) and experience unique
cognitions that contribute to DEB; however, they have historically been excluded from DEB research.
Additionally, extant DEB research with TGD youth is limited due to a lack of representation of subpopulations of
TGD youth participants, mainly non-binary youth and TGD youth of color. These gaps in research limit the field's
ability to provide culturally specific clinical care to a vulnerable group with unique health disparities associated
with DEB. To advance this care, we urgently need to extend DEB research beyond cisgender females and recruit
racially/ethnically diverse samples of TGD youth across the spectrum of age, gender identity, and access to
gender-affirming support/resources. A novel approach to address these knowledge gaps is to implement
community-engaged research methods to develop and evaluate a tailored measure of DEB in TGD youth. The
proposed research has three aims: 1. Obtain qualitative data from a diverse sample of TGD youth on facilitators
of and barriers to research participation to improve recruitment protocols for the remaining aims, 2. Use focus
groups and cognitive interviews to develop and refine a measure of DEB in TGD youth, 3. Evaluate the
psychometric properties of the DEB measure and assess correlations between DEB and TGD-specific risk and
protective factors. A TGD youth advisory board and community consultant with expertise in DEB in TGD youth
will actively participate in research protocols throughout the 4-year grant proposal. Research activities include
designing recruitment matrices, conducting qualitative interviews and analyses, and disseminating results. The
data from this innovative study will inform a longitudinal study on changes in DEB throughout: 1) eating disorder
treatment in TGD youth with DEB, 2) pubertal development in TGD youth, and 3) gender-affirming care in TGD
youth receiving gender-affirming medications such as testosterone, estrogen, and/or puberty blockers. This
proposal is highly consistent with NIMH's priority of expanding research involving sexual and gender minority
(SGM) populations to reduce the mental health disparities experienced by vulnerable SGM communities. Dr. An
Pham is an Adolescent Medicine physician with clinical expertise in gender-affirming medical care and this K23
Career Development Award will fill gaps in her training and provide her with the necessary mentorship and skills
to become an independent investigator on youth-engaged DEB research in TGD youth. Specifically, Dr. Pham
will work closely with her mentorship team and community partners to advance her knowledge and skills in
qualitative and mixed methods community-engaged research, recruitment of marginalized populations, and
advanced statistical approaches to measure development and evaluation."

Program Overview
This is a single consolidated U2C/TL1 training program (the Learners to LeAders in benign Urology, benign
Nephrology, and non-Cancer Hematology [LAUNCH] Program) that seeks to integrate, expand, and transform
kidney, urologic, and hematologic (KUH) biomedical research training in Northern California. Based at four
institutions with outstanding research resources and training accomplishments—University of California San
Francisco (UCSF), University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley), University of California Davis (UC Davis),
and Stanford University—we propose an innovative approach to train 22 (4 pre- and 18 post-doctoral) trainees
annually across adult and pediatric KUH disciplines. We will identify and recruit the most promising and diverse
group of trainees to enable them to conduct KUH research and provide these LAUNCH Program trainees with
outstanding basic, translational, or clinical research training. Our overall goal is to establish a unified training
program that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration and training of the most promising junior investigators
across our four institutions. Thus, we expect that the LAUNCH Program will graduate scientists who are well-
trained, able to compete successfully for research funding, and able to think creatively and collaboratively to
generate novel and impactful science. The LAUNCH Program will be led by the U2C multi-PI’s (Drs. Elaine
Ku, Marshall Stoller, and Kathleen Sakamoto) as well as the TL1 multi-PI’s (Drs. Chi-yuan Hsu, Philip Beachy,
and Mark Walters), each of whom possess complementary expertise in research and research training within
the disciplines of nephrology, urology, and hematology. The world-class training faculty whom we have
included in our program were selected not only based on their own scientific and scholarly achievements but
also their track record of mentorship and commitment to training. The LAUNCH Program is modeled after
several highly-successful training programs at our institutions that have trained numerous exceptional
scientists from a wide range of disciplines using a team science approach."
10907813,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
LATE-NC (limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa [TDP-43]
encephalopathy neuropathological change), a recently recognized form of TDP-43 proteinopathy, is the third
most impactful cause of dementia following Alzheimer’s disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and
cerebrovascular disease, accounting for 15-20% of all dementia cases in older adults. Genetic association
studies by our group and others revealed unique, LATE-NC-specific risk loci as well as those shared with other
common dementia-causing proteinopathies. A transcriptomic study from our group implicated endo-lysosomal
dysregulation as a crucial pathophysiologic process underlying LATE-NC. However, molecular and cellular
underpinnings of LATE-NC remain largely unknown: we do not even have the knowledge to develop in vitro/in
vivo disease models or nominate target pathways, and as a result, we cannot diagnose, treat, or prevent
LATE-NC in living persons yet. Defining molecular and cellular changes underlying LATE-NC is a prerequisite
to developing translatable in vitro/in vivo disease models and identifying biomarker/therapeutic targets. This
critical knowledge gap has been acknowledged by the NIH AD-Related Dementias (ADRD) Summit in 2022,
which made a high-priority recommendation to investigate molecular changes associated with LATE-NC.
Therefore, this proposal aims to define the transcriptomic, proteomic, and cellular underpinnings of LATE-NC
in the human amygdala, the brain region where LATE-NC is thought to originate. Our central hypothesis is that,
in the amygdala, endo-lysosomal dysregulation, altered RNA metabolism, glial dysfunction, and neuronal loss
underlie LATE-NC pathophysiology. To test the central hypothesis, we propose to generate and analyze
transcriptomic, proteomic, and single-nucleus multiome (transcriptome and chromatin accessibility) data from
the post-mortem amygdala samples from the extensively characterized Religious Orders Study and Rush
Memory and Aging Project participants (n=480). We will pursue the following three specific aims: First, we will
determine the transcriptomic underpinnings of LATE-NC. Second, we will identify the proteomic signature of
LATE-NC. Third, we will define the single-cell landscape of LATE-NC. We will use statistical modeling
approaches to infer causal relationships. We will consider sex-specific effects and the confounding effect of
comorbid ADNC pathology throughout the study. The expected outcomes of this project will nominate protein
biomarker targets and define plausible upstream and downstream events of LATE-NC. These results will guide
our future studies to develop in vitro and possibly in vivo LATE-NC models and, eventually, targeted
therapeutics. The large-scale amygdala multi-omic data will be broadly shared with the scientific community to
support numerous ADRD research projects, ensuring a significant lasting impact in neurodegeneration
research far beyond this proposal. Therefore, this project has the potential to fundamentally improve our ability
to diagnose, treat, and ultimately prevent dementia, including LATE."

Glia are supportive cells in the human brain, comprising microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and ependymal cells.
Glia are deeply involved in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer’s (AD), autism, pain, affective disorders,
and cancers. Different glial cell types play different mechanistic roles in disease formation, driven by specific genes.
Modulating glial gene expression via a process called gene therapy could thus be studied as a means of preventing
deleterious effects of glia in the brain. However, while significant progress has been made in delivering genes exclusively
to neurons, such capabilities are lacking for glia, despite their demonstrated role in disease formation, posing a critical
medical need. Although gene delivery to neurons can be achieved using viral vectors, their use to transmit genes to glia
in-vivo has been unsuccessful. Here, we propose to design a novel nonviral gene delivery vector targeting microglia or
astrocytes exclusively by bioengineering Modified RNAs (ModRNAs). ModRNAs are synthetic RNA molecules known
not to trigger an immune response and are strongly expressed in target cells. Currently, ModRNAs enable only days-
long expression, impeding long-duration medical applications and lacking cell specificity to glia types. We will engineer
glia-type-specific, ModRNAs-based constructs, GliaRNAs, as a platform for glia-exclusive gene therapy, with a
customizable expression duration. First, ModRNAs that enable robust and prolonged expression (7-14 days) will be
developed (Aim 1). For this purpose, existing ModRNA will be altered, through modifications and by inflicting random
mutations of structural components of the molecule, including CAP analog, 3’ untranslated region, coding region, 5’
untranslated region, and the poly-A tail. We will test the expression of these novel GliaRNAs in glial cultures from mice.
Next, the vector specificity will be optimized (Aim 2). We will screen for molecular manipulations that enable robust and
specific delivery of the GliaRNAs into either microglia or astrocytes (GliaRNA-vectors) and select the best gene delivery
vectors, specifically either lipid nanoparticles, antibody-lipid conjugates, or aptamers. As a proof of concept, we will use
the new GliaRNA-vector technology to express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in either astrocytes or microglia in
mice brains. The GliaRNA-vector platform will pave the way for genetically healing and modifying different types
of glia, opening multiple therapeutic and research avenues in humans by targeting neurodegeneration, autism,
pain disorders, mood disorders, and brain cancers."
10923936,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer (BC) is the tenth most diagnosed cancer in the world, and is strongly linked to environmental
chemical exposures including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). BaP is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and
widespread pollutant found in automobile exhaust, tobacco smoke, and charred food, but the mechanisms
underlying the links between BaP and BC remain unclear. Additionally, not all individuals exposed to BaP
develop BC, indicating that there are additional undefined or individualized risk factors associated with BC.
While human cells can metabolize BaP, host-associated microbes can too. Moreover, host-associated
microbiomes, like host genomes, are individualized, which could drive differences in host responses to BaP
exposure. However, the role of microbes in BC, and specifically, how the gut and urine microbiome modulate
exposure to BaP, is largely unexplored. There is a critical need to evaluate chemical-microbe-host interactions
in relation to high-risk chemicals – like BaP – on bladder health. The objective of this application is to define
microbial metabolism of BaP in vitro and in vivo and asses the effects of this metabolism on the urothelium.
BaP along with its metabolites are excreted in urine, have been linked to BC, and can be metabolized by
microbes. However, it is unknown if microbial metabolism of BaP is occurring in vivo and how the microbiome
may influence this metabolism. Our overarching hypothesis is that microbial metabolism of BaP is playing a
role in bladder carcinogenesis. Specifically, we predict that urine and stool microbes can either “toxify” or
“detoxify” BaP, with “toxifying” metabolism defined here as that which yields secondary metabolites more
damaging or carcinogenic to host cells. In our first aim, we will characterize metabolism of BaP in vitro by
urothelial cells and by gut or urinary tract-associated microbes. Host cells and bacteria will be grown in the
presence or absence of BaP, separately and together, and we will apply targeted metabolomics (GC-MS) to
quantify BaP metabolism. In the second aim, we will characterize metabolism of BaP in vivo through the gut
and urine microbiome and metabolome of mouse models with differing microbial community profiles. In aim
three, we will evaluate urothelial response (toxicity and inflammation) to BaP exposure in vitro and in vivo using
samples from the first two aims. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive
departure from the status quo by defining chemical-microbe interactions and their direct impact on the bladder
epithelium. This approach will create novel opportunities for bladder health and BC management through
microbial community manipulation and engineering. Upon completion of the proposed aims, we will have
identified which microbes can metabolize BaP, how they do so, if this metabolism is occurring in vivo, how
differing microbial communities influence this metabolism, and how this affects urothelial response. This
research is significant because it will establish a novel chemical-microbe-host framework for evaluating
chemical safety, bladder health, and BC development."
10739232,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) remains the leading etiologic agent of neonatal bacterial meningitis and a major
opportunistic pathogen in certain adult populations, including pregnant women. During pregnancy, GBS
asymptomatically colonizes the vaginal tract of 20-30% of healthy women but can be transmitted to the neonate
in utero or during birth resulting in neonatal meningitis upon GBS disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
10-15% mortality, regardless of antibiotic treatment. Despite this major public health concern, the
mechanisms
 specific
by which Group B streptococcal effectors mediate toxicity and drive inflammatory responses during
colonization and development of meningitis are still being elucidated. Type VII secretion systems (T7SS) have
been identified in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes and shown to secrete
functions
GBS
lacking
highly immunogenic effector proteins with
in virulence, host toxicity, or interbacterial killing; however, a T7SS had never been characterized in
 and our analysis suggests that GBS encodes unique T7SS effectors. My recent work shows that GBS
the ATPase EssC (which drives T7SS) or the secreted T7 effector EsxA areattenuated in murine models
of meningitis and reproductive tract ascending infection and exhibit decreased cytotoxicity in brain endothelium.
We have further shown that EsxA is a pore-forming protein, possibly mediating T7SS-dependent cytotoxicity.
Finally, my recent work suggests that IL-17 is important for clearance of GBS during vaginal colonization and
may be dampened by the T7SS resulting in GBS immune evasion. Based on these data, this K22 proposal seeks
to identify GBS T7-secreted effectors and elucidate the mechanism by which they mediate promote host toxicity
and elicit immune responses during GBS disease progression and colonization. These questions will be
addressed with both in vitro and in vivo models of GBS vaginal colonization and BBB penetration in the following
specific aims:
AIM 1: Elucidate the mechanism of GBS EsxA pore-formation and host cytotoxicity.
AIM 2: Identify and characterize the GBS T7SS secretome.
AIM 3: Evaluate the T7SS-dependent IL-17 responses to GBS in the female reproductive tract
This proposal is the first to characterize GBS T7SS effectors and their role in both GBS colonization and
pathogenesis and may afford novel targets and alternative therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent GBS
disease."

these goals. In recently published work, the candidate has demonstrated the feasibility of using dynamic cine-
MRI for non-invasive characterization of multiple aspects of gastric function in healthy subjects and patients with
functional dyspepsia (FD). In this proposal, the candidate seeks to apply MRI-based tools to compare the impact
of stimulation at different acupoint locations on brainstem neurocircuitry and gastric motility in patients with FD,
as well as the interaction between treatment and expectancy manipulation.
The specific goals of this study are to 1) evaluate the underlying brainstem neurocircuitry of transcutaneous
electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) in FD; 2) compare the effect of leg (acupoint ST36) versus abdomen
(acupoint ST25) TEAS on gastric motility in FD; 3) evaluate the effect of expectancy manipulation on meal-
evoked symptoms and physiological outcomes. As an integral part of this proposal, the candidate’s career
development will be complemented by participation in advanced coursework to develop expertise in placebo
research, integrative medicine, gastroenterology, and conduct of clinical trials. A formal mentorship committee,
consisting of multidisciplinary experts in placebo research, neurogastroenterology, neuroimaging, acupuncture,
and integrative medicine, will provide supervision, guidance, and assistance for the candidate to achieve her
goals. The research environment, which includes the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, the Athinoula A.
Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Center for Integrative Pain Neuroimaging (CiPNI), the
Gastrointestinal Unit and MGH Center for Neurointestinal Health, and the Harvard Medical School will provide a

10913574,"Environmental endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are associated with multiple adverse health effects. Early-
life exposures alter neurobehavioral trajectories, with increased risk for depression and poorer cognitive
functioning in childhood. However, very few studies have evaluated the effects of EDC exposure in later life
despite ongoing exposure. Patients with a history of major depression (MDD) are at increased risk for
neuropsychiatric symptoms such as low mood and cognitive dysfunction and this risk is further elevated in
women during the menopausal and post-menopausal period. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that
EDCs affect a number of biological variables implicated in mood and cognitive disorders, including inflammatory
biomarkers, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and sex hormones. The proposed study seeks to better
understand how EDCs affect mood and cognition in postmenopausal women with and without depression. We
propose to evaluate 1) the association between EDCs and neuropsychiatric symptoms (mood and cognition) in
postmenopausal women with MDD and without mood disorders (healthy controls; HC), 2) the relationship
between EDCs and biological variables including inflammatory cytokines like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6,
and tumor necrosis factor-α, BDNF, and sex hormones including estradiol and testosterone, and 3) whether the
biological variables of interest mediate any potential association of EDCs with neuropsychiatric outcomes. We
will leverage ongoing data collection of an existing study of postmenopausal women including depression rating
scale scores and detailed cognitive assessment data, as well as serum cytokine, BDNF, and sex hormone levels.
Urinary bisphenols and a suite of 16 phthalate metabolites will be measured in 75 MDD and 75 HC subjects.
Urine will be collected at 2 timepoints (at recruitment and 1 month later), then pooled for EDC assessment.
Regression and statistical methods for mixtures will be used to assess relationships between individual EDCs
and their mixtures with neuropsychiatric outcomes and biomarkers. Mediation analysis will explore the direct and
indirect effect of EDCs on outcome measures via the biological variables. Career development plan goals include
gaining competency in the interpretation of environmental exposures and inflammatory data and in biostatistics,
especially mixture methods of analysis. Training goals will be met by coursework, workshops/seminars,
conferences, lab experience, readings, and mentorship. Training experiences will mostly take place at Harvard-
affiliated BWH and HSPH. This project will identify emotional and cognitive effects and relevant biological effects
of EDCs in a population vulnerable to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Enhanced mechanistic understanding will
allow novel interventions targeting contributory biological variables, such as lifestyle changes or medications that
reduce inflammation, increase BDNF, and regulate sex hormones to mitigate adverse effects of EDCs. Increased
awareness of neuropsychiatric implications of EDC exposures may also guide public policy changes that regulate
or reduce their omnipresence in consumer products and the environment."

and masker speech sources in space. Older listeners – even those with ‘near-normal’ hearing – tend to have
compromised binaural temporal processing and exhibit less binaural advantage. Determining the factors that
underlie this is key to understanding the constraints on the abilities of older listeners to communicate and
function in the spatially and acoustically complex soundscape of our every-day environment. The purpose of
this project is to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the spatial hearing abilities of adults across a wide
age range, with a particular emphasis on differentiating effects of age and hearing loss. This will have
particular relevance to understanding the hearing difficulties of older listeners with otherwise ‘near-normal’
hearing. Specific Aims focus on binaural temporal processing and spatialized speech-in-speech recognition,
particularly under dynamic conditions. The approach uniquely combines behavioral and electrophysiological
measures, and also incorporates the listener’s cognitive profile. The findings will advance our understanding of
the benefits of spatial hearing, and the dependence of these benefits on the fidelity of temporal information
available to the listener. These outcomes will be directly relevant to the public health challenge of addressing
the communication difficulties experienced by the burgeoning older population."

The serious concerns of the health-care community around the current state of worldwide N. gonorrhoeae infec-
tions are well known and documented in the infectious diseases, microbiology and immunology communities
and literature. The major manifestations of gonococcal (GC) infection worldwide are genital tract infections and
conjunctivitis, the latter a major problem in infants born in low and middle income countries, diagnosed as oph-
thalmia neonatorum. There is a global concern about effective treatments due to antimicrobial resistance and
the threat of pan-resistant, untreatable GC infections is high. Thus, new approaches, strategies and tools are
needed to address the consequences from this exceedingly successful human pathogen. At the top of this list
are vaccines and immunotherapeutics to control GC infection and transmission. Yet, unlike its cousin, N. men-
ingitides, where vaccine-preventable disease has been obtained by targeting the immunogenic, serologically
variable capsular polysaccharides or, more recently, surface proteins for serogroup B, such vaccine targets have
not been identified on N. gonorrhoeae cells. Indeed, there are no known correlates of human immunity mediating
resistance to GC infection. Furthermore, reinfection with N. gonorrhoeae seems to occur sufficiently frequently
to suggest that vaccine antigens are either serologically variable and differ markedly among strains, or, infection
with GC simply does not engender sufficient protective immune responses.
 The goal of this research project is to develop and validate a murine model of N. gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis in
both adult and neonatal mice to study virulence and immunity to this pathogen in a readily accessible laboratory
animal model. A second goal will be to evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of antibody therapeu-
tics to N. gonorrhoeae to substantiate the utility of the conjunctival infection model for such studies. These targets
include the conserved bacterial surface polysaccharide poly-N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG) that we have shown
surrounds the outer surface of N. gonorrhoeae and serves as a target for bactericidal antibody, and the surface
lipooligosaccharide (LOS) recognized by monoclonal antibody (MAb) 2C7.
 We propose to take advantage of our extensive experience with murine models of ocular infections to study N.
gonorrhoeae conjunctivitis in adult and neonatal mice. We will determine the growth and dose parameters
needed to establish infection in both of these murine settings, the latter as a model for ophthalmia neonatorum.
We will evaluate pathogenesis of multiple N. gonorrhoeae strains, test active and passive immunotherapies for
impacting bacterial burdens and conjunctival pathology, and determine some of the in vitro and in vivo immune
effectors needed to impact these measures of infection and disease. Success would open up the potential to
readily study additional vaccines and therapies, as well as virulence factors and host innate and acquired im-
munity to N. gonorrhoeae in a clinically-relevant setting. Thus, an in vivo murine model for GC conjunctival
infection would fill in the gaps currently limiting the study of virulence and immunity to N. gonorrhoeae infections."
10906115,"AB toxins consist of a catalytic A subunit and a cell-binding B subunit. They are released into the extracellular
space but attack targets within the host cytosol. Entry into the cytosol only occurs after toxin endocytosis from
the plasma membrane of the target cell. Some AB toxins, including pertussis toxin (PT) and cholera toxin (CT),
travel to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) before toxin disassembly and A chain passage into the cytosol. We
have shown the dissociated A chain spontaneously unfolds at 37°C, which triggers its export to the cytosol
through the mechanism of ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Most ERAD substrates are extracted to the
cytosol through the action of the AAA ATPase p97, but we have shown that the catalytic subunits of PT (PTS1)
and CT (CTA1) instead require the cytosolic chaperone Hsp90 for passage into the cytosol. Hsp90 was not
thought to recognize any specific feature of an unfolded protein, but we identified an RPP binding motif for
Hsp90 at the N-terminus of PTS1 and CTA1. Recent studies have documented a functional role for Grp94, the
ER-localized Hsp90 family member, in PTS1 translocation and PT intoxication. Preliminary evidence further
suggests the tight association between Grp94 and PTS1 is disrupted by cyclophilin B (CypB), an ER-localized
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPI). Our resulting model for ERAD-mediated toxin translocation proposes
that PTS1 proline residues drive toxin-chaperone interactions on both sides of the ER membrane. This novel
concept will be examined using either loss-of-function studies in cell culture or in vitro studies on toxin structure,
toxin-chaperone binding, and toxin translocation from ER-derived microsomes. We predict CypB and its PPI
activity will be required for the release of Grp94 from PTS1, PTS1 export to the cytosol, and PT intoxication.
Both Grp94 and Hsp90 will be required for PTS1 translocation and PT intoxication. These two chaperones will
recognize distinct proline-containing regions of PTS1, and loss of either binding site will trap PTS1 in the ER.
Grp94 will prevent the thermal unfolding of PTS1 but will not refold the toxin at 37°C, whereas Hsp90 will refold
disordered PTS1 in an ATP-dependent manner that is sufficient for toxin extraction to the cytosol. This work
could establish the importance of proline residues for toxin translocation by documenting a role for CypB in
PTS1 export, a functional link between CypB and Grp94 in the processing of PTS1, and how PTS1
translocation involves the distinct functions of Hsp90 family members at both sides of the ER membrane.
Cyclophilin and Hsp90 family members can be found in a complex and frequently act on the same substrates,
but these coordinated functions have not yet been documented for ERAD-mediated toxin translocation. Both
protein families represent promising pharmacological targets for treating whooping cough through the
inactivation of PT. A deeper understanding of PTS1-chaperone interactions could thus lead to more precise
and effective therapeutics against the specific proteins required for PTS1 translocation."
10906989,"Project Summary
The average human lifespan has almost doubled over the past century, leading to an increase in the prevalence of
diseases of aging, such as cardiovascular disease, arthritis, cognitive decline and autoimmune disorders. Aging is
associated with a decline in adaptive immune function and an increase in inflammation, which underlie many
age-related diseases. These immunological changes are similar to those seen in individuals exposed to social
adversity, who may age more rapidly than those unexposed. Yet, it is unclear how social adversity alters immunity
across demographic factors - data that are essential to identify how it might increase aging-related diseases. The
central objective of this proposal is to identify the specific cell types and molecular markers of the immune
system that contribute to the aging process and how social adversity shapes the function of these cells and
markers. To test this, I draw on a longitudinal study of free-ranging nonhuman primates – the Cayo Santiago
rhesus macaques. These animals present a unique opportunity to examine aging and its social determinants. First,
rhesus macaques have a strong phylogenetic proximity to humans and show very similar aging trajectories,
making them an exceptional model for human health. Second, rhesus macaques form stable social structures that
dictate individuals' access to resources and peers, similar to human populations- making this species an ideal
model in which to study the potential effect that social adversity has on accelerating aging. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that social adversity leads to an impaired immune system, recapitulating the
effects of aging, which consequently accelerates the biological signatures of aging independently of an
individual’s chronological age. To test this hypothesis, I will collect data from the Cayo Santiago rhesus
macaque population over two years, totaling a sample size of 200 individuals. Aim 1 of this proposal will measure
and explore how both age social adversity and age alter immunity at baseline by measuring different immune cell
types – both lymphocytes and monocyte subpopulations- using flow cytometry. Aim 2 of this project will test
how age and social adversity alter the immune response to an infection, and if they do so in a similar way. Here,
we will create a pro-inflammatory (Th1) and anti-inflammatory (Th2) immune response by isolating and
stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using live pathogens and pathogens molecules. In recent
years, it has become clear that the social environment plays a critical role in the development and overall health
across different species. By combining physiological data and behavioral observations, the proposed project will
generate data that is necessary to understand the role that social adversity may play in inducing aging-related
changes in immunity. Ultimately, this project will reveal how the social environment alters the pace of aging,
which will inform the targeted development of social and physiological interventions that could reduce the burden
of aging-related disease in our aging population."
10917265,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A “good death” is often desired but seldom delivered for patients with cancer. Because oncologists often do not
recognize when a patient is near the end of life (EOL), many patients receive aggressive care until death. To
remedy this, prognostic tools are needed to identify patients nearing death. How to incorporate these tools into
routine cancer care and use them to prompt best practices, such as serious illness conversations and hospice
referrals, is not well understood. The long-term goal is to leverage evidence-based tools to improve EOL care
for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The main objective is to integrate a validated breast cancer
prognostic tool into routine practice using implementation science. This research study will pursue three aims:
1) Define the baseline frequency of documented serious illness conversations and hospice referrals among
patients with metastatic breast cancer and their relationship to prognostic risk scores; 2) Co-design an
implementation protocol with patient, caregiver, and care team partners for use of a metastatic breast cancer
prognostic tool in an oncology clinic; and 3) Pilot implementation of a metastatic breast cancer prognostic tool
in an oncology clinic and assess implementation outcomes. For the first aim, a retrospective study using EHR
data from patients with MBC will quantify baseline EOL best practices and define their relationship to
prognostic scores. For the second aim, interviews and user-centered research with oncologists, patients, and
caregivers will evaluate factors that impede or enable implementation of the tool in practice and identify desired
features of the prognostic tool implementation. These key partners will co-design an implementation protocol.
For the third aim, the tool will be piloted in an oncology clinic according to the protocol and evaluated for
implementation outcomes using surveys, interviews, and secondary data in a mixed method design. This
project seeks to innovate by shifting the paradigm from sole reliance on clinician judgement towards use of
evidence-based tools to estimate prognosis. The proposed study is significant for its potential to improve EOL
quality for patients with MBC through timely identification of high-risk patients and earlier initiation of EOL best
practices. This proposal is submitted by Emily Ray, MD, MPH, a breast medical oncologist and health services
researcher at the University of North Carolina in the Cancer Outcomes Research Program. The proposed
career development plan will equip her with skills in implementation science, mixed methods, cancer care
quality, and multi-site trials to accelerate her research from its evidence basis in large datasets towards
interventions aimed at improving cancer care quality. The academic environment at the University of North
Carolina, with leading programs in breast oncology, cancer outcomes research, and public health, and her
outstanding mentoring team including Dr. Jennifer Leeman, a well-funded, national expert in implementation
science, positions Dr. Ray to make an impact through designing, testing, and implementing evidence-based
interventions to deliver high-quality, patient-centered end-of-life cancer care."
10897066,"Project Summary/Abstract of CARE 2.0
 Despite being the fastest growing racial population in the United States, Asian American,
Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) persons remain severely underrepresented in
research. For example, less than 3% of participants in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating
Center database are AANHPI individuals and even fewer are enrolled in clinical trials of
promising therapeutics. The Collaborative Approach for Research and Education (CARE)
registry (R24 AG063718) is a US multi-lingual registry built to improve AANHPI representation
in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), aging, and caregiving research.
Launched in October 2020, CARE has enrolled 9,405 AANHPI adults (as of 10/2/22) including
55.9% with limited English proficiency and 80.9% with no prior research participation
experience. CARE has referred more than >5,500 participants to 27 studies that are in various
stages of recruitment and study completion. As a critical next step and guided by the NIA health
disparities framework, we propose CARE 2.0 to strategically expand the registry, advance the
science of recruitment and retention of AANHPI participants, and examine the factors
associated with research enrollment decisions among referred registry participants. Our specific
aims include: 1) Examine attitudes toward health research in a diverse cohort of 10,000 newly
recruited AANHPI adults in the US; 2) Elicit perspectives and recommendations from CARE
participants about registry retention, and develop, implement, and evaluate recommended
registry retention strategies. The Lightning Report Method will be used to conduct dynamic
qualitative data analysis and rapid synthesis of the findings to allow rapid comparative analyses
across groups and contexts to derive targeted strategies that are sensitive to the diverse needs
of retaining AANHPI participants; and 3) Optimize CARE registry participants’ inclusion in NIA-
funded and other aging studies and examine factors including study- and participant-level
factors associated with participation in research. These innovative aims will increase and test
the value of the CARE registry and inform the field more broadly on how best to increase
representation of AANHPI groups in research. CARE is well-positioned to complete these aims
and contribute to the growing science of recruitment and retention. This proposed application is
responsive to PAR-22-093 (Research on Current Topics in ADRD) and NOT-AG-21-033 (Notice

10874699,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There has been a significant rise in opioid use disorder (OUD) in the United States over the past decade, making
it imperative to gain a better understanding of the behavioral characteristics underlying OUD vulnerability.
Current rodent models focus on how one or few traits interact in a linear manner to predict substance use disorder
(SUD), however, OUD consists of several symptoms that interact with one another across the addiction process
and can vary between individuals to affect OUD vulnerability or resiliency. I contributed toward a rat model that
captures this behavioral complexity using male and female heterogeneous stock rats in an effort to better model
human OUD. Bayesian stochastic block model (SBM) network-based clustering analysis is used to separate rats
into resilient and vulnerable subpopulations. Using this model, we are able to assess the neurobiological
mechanisms contributing toward OUD vulnerability and resiliency, the latter of which is not well understood.
These opposing phenotypes are likely mediated by different cellular and circuitry adaptations, and will be the
focus of this proposal. The K99 aims assess how functional and morphological neuroplasticity differences in
nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) D1/D2 medium-spiny neuron (MSN) contribute to OUD resiliency and
vulnerability. I will first use whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to characterize changes in AMPA/NMDA
ratios in vulnerable and resilient subpopulations following cued reinstatement (Aim 1). I will then inject an
intracellular label into the recorded cell and examine differences in D1/D2-MSN dendritic spine morphology (Aim
2). This approach will allow for the tracking of NAcc neuroplastic adaptations within the same cell across the two
phenotypes. The R00 portion of the proposal will assess how pathway specific regulation of dorsolateral ventral
pallidum (dlVP) projections contribute to OUD resiliency and vulnerability. Comparable to the NAcc, the dlVP,
the main functional output of the NAcc, shows cell-specific functional regulation of drug seeking and refraining
behavior, making it an ideal structure to evaluate circuit heterogeneity in individual variation in OUD propensity.
Using confocal microscopy and viral tracers, I will assess functional connectivity from the dlVP to the subthalamic
nucleus (STN), a region known to enhance seeking and likely vulnerability, and to the lateral habenula (LHb),
known to mediate aversion and hypothesized to promote resiliency (Aim 3a). I will then employ chemogenetic
technology to selectively isolate and manipulate these pathways in OUD resilient and vulnerable rats. (Aim 3b).
Lastly, using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, I will evaluate input adaptations in the STN and LHb
following dlVP stimulation within the two phenotypes following cued reinstatement (Aim 4). Experiments in this
proposal employ a novel rat model capturing individual variation in OUD propensity similar to what is observed
in humans. Work from this proposal will greatly contribute to our knowledge of the cellular and circuitry
mechanisms contributing to OUD resiliency versus vulnerability."

Cancer survivors often suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as a result of their cancer
diagnosis and treatment, which impair health outcomes such as quality of life (QOL). Although traditional
office-based cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) are effective, cancer survivors often lack access due to cost
and distance barriers. At highest risk for persistent or worsening PTSD symptoms are low-income and/or
nonwhite cancer survivors who received hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) as part of an aggressive
cancer treatment. Mobile Health (mHealth) programs are increasingly used to facilitate access to CBT; some
are self-guided and others require individualized, more intensive videoconferenced sessions with therapists.
Hence, a continuum of mHealth CBT-based (mCBT) solutions with differing levels of intensity is available to
support cancer survivors with PTSD symptoms. “Right-sizing” treatment ensures optimal benefit without
wasting resources such as patient time and healthcare costs.
This grant application aims to answer the question: What is the right intervention solution for this cancer
survivor at risk for, or suffering from, PTSD symptoms? We propose to construct and refine an adaptive
(individually-tailored) mHealth approach for managing symptoms of PTSD in cancer survivors who recently
completed autologous or allogeneic HCT therapy, including those who are most at risk for poor outcomes and
have the greatest opportunity to benefit. Our research team is comprised of national leaders in the area,
including the investigators who have defined the problem as well as devised potential mCBT solutions. One of
these solutions is Cancer Distress Coach, a mobile application developed in partnership with the National
Center for PTSD, as an effective self-management tool for addressing symptoms. It will be used with more
intensive mCBT therapies that require individualized sessions with therapists to address these study aims: 1)
Evaluate the effectiveness of Cancer Distress Coach relative to a control in reducing PTSD symptoms among
HCT cancer survivors; 2) Assess treatment regimens embedded in the trial design for PTSD symptom
reduction; and 3) Estimate tailored treatment regimens for PTSD and related outcomes that generate
hypotheses about if, and how treatment should be tailored. These aims address symptom management - one
of ten National Cancer Moonshort Initiative recommendations – and the underserved have the greatest
opportunity for benefit.
Methods include using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to establish decision
rules regarding when and in what way to intensify treatment for HCT cancer survivors (n=400) with Cancer
Distress Coach and a more intensive mCBT. Electronic data collection surveys will be used and clickstream
data captured to examine usage."
10890153,"Project Summary
Genome-wide association studies for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) found that >70% loci are localized
to genes that are enriched in microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain. The most significant risk variant
for LOAD is apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) and its homozygosity increasing AD risk >15-fold. APOE is
predominantly expressed in astrocytes and significantly upregulated in microglia near amyloid plaques and by
neurodegenerative environments. While microglia protect against development of AD by clearing toxic cellular
debris and compacting amyloid plaques, environmental and genetic factors can cause microglia to enter
persistent reactive states in which they escalate disease via excessive inflammation and neurotoxicity. Given
the role of microglia in AD pathogenesis, microglia-targeted pharmacological and cell therapeutic interventions
may be able to protect against AD progression in selectively vulnerable brain regions such as the entorhinal
cortex and hippocampus. In the APPNL-G-F AD mouse model, both regions show amyloidosis, reactive gliosis,
and synaptic loss in prodromal stages, especially the entorhinal cortex shows electrophysiological impairment
prior to cognitive impairment. Thus, these regions are critical targets for preclinical development of novel
therapeutics for prodromal AD. Acute pharmacological inhibition of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor with the
brain-penetrant drug PLX5622 has been shown to selectively induce “turnover” of microglia (near complete
removal of existing microglia and self-renewal of survived microglia), which rescues abnormal hippocampal
activity, promotes brain repair, and ameliorates cognitive deficits in aging, traumatic brain injury, and maternal
immune activation models. Replacement of AD risk (proinflammatory or APOE4) microglia with APOE3 neutral
or APOE2 protective human iPSC-derived microglia may be a promising microglia-targeted AD therapeutic.
Therefore, we hypothesize that electrophysiological, molecular, and cellular dysfunctions in the entorhinal cortex
and hippocampus at prodromal disease stages is driven by proinflammatory reactive microglia signatures (Aim
1) and APOE4 genotype microglia (Aim 2). It can potentially be treated in adulthood by pharmacologically forced-
turnover of AD microglia (Aim 1) and AD microglia replacement with APOE 33 or 22 microglia-like cells (Aim 3).
In Aim 1, we will demonstrate molecular and functional changes in forced turnover of microglia on the entorhinal
cortex and hippocampus of prodromal AD mice using neuron-like electronic probes during spatial navigation
virtual reality. In Aim 2, we will determine APOE genotype effects of human microglia on vulnerability of the
entorhinal and hippocampal neurons in chimeric human/mouse AD model. In Aim 3, we will establish cell
replacement therapeutics in adulthood by replacing AD microglia to APOE3 or APOE2 cells in adult mice. The
goal of this research is to demonstrate molecular mechanisms by which AD and APOE isoform microglia affect
neuronal network and to determine the efficacy by which microglia-targeted pharmacological and human iPSC-
based therapeutic strategies protect neurons and memory circuits that are selectively vulnerable in AD patients."
10885193,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the role of environmental factors including signals derived from the diet and microbiota is key to
improving therapeutic and intervention strategies for gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD) and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer (CRC). Dietary fiber can exert immunoregulatory
effects through microbial fermentation products including short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). However, the influence
of dietary fiber on most microbiota-derived metabolites and their role in immunoregulation remain unclear. In
new preliminary studies, I identified that an inulin-rich high fiber diet triggers colonic eosinophilia in a microbiota-
dependent manner which exacerbates disease outcomes in murine models of intestinal damage and
inflammation-associated CRC. These diet-induced type 2 inflammatory responses are associated with
upregulation of microbiota-derived bile acids and activation of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s). However, the cellular and molecular components in the host and the metabolic
pathways in the microbiota that mediate the dietary effects on intestinal inflammation remain unclear. In Aim 1,
I will determine how bile acids regulate type 2 cytokines and eosinophilia during high fiber diet-induced intestinal
inflammation. In Aim 2, I will investigate how dietary fiber-induced eosinophils contribute to intestinal damage.
In Aim 3, I will employ bacterial genetics and gnotobiotic approaches to identify the microbial metabolic pathways
required for high fiber diet-induced intestinal inflammation. Upon successful completion of the proposed aims, I
expect to contribute to a fundamentally new understanding of the biology of dietary fiber, microbiota-derived
metabolites, and stromal cells in regulating type 2 inflammation which could contribute to rational design of diet-
and microbiota-based therapeutic approaches. My overarching career goals are to become an independent
investigator and an inspirational mentor at a leading academic institution and to study the mechanisms by which
environmental factors regulate intestinal inflammation and gastrointestinal diseases. Completion of my research
aims in this proposal will allow me to develop various scientific, professional, and personal skills critical to
become a successful independent investigator. These will include acquiring expertise in various fields including
metabolomic analyses and genetic engineering with help of my collaborators, as well as developing skills in
writing, mentoring, communicating and laboratory management. I will perform the K99 phase in the laboratory of
Dr. David Artis, a world leader in the fields of mucosal immunology and host-microbiota interactions. The
laboratory has access to all instruments and facilities necessary to complete the proposed aims including a
gnotobiotic animal facility and provides an outstanding environment and training program to support postdoctoral
researchers. In addition to my mentor and co-mentor, I have support from several distinguished investigators
with extensive expertise as advisors and collaborators that will greatly facilitate the completion of my experiments
during the K99 phase as I progress to become an independent investigator."

Emory University in partnership with the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), a historically Black University,
propose to establish a Southeastern Environmental Exposures and Disparities (SEED) mentored career
development scholars program, in response to the Pediatric and Reproductive Environmental Health Scholars
program (PREHS) (K12), RFA-ES-20-007. The overarching goal is to recruit junior clinical faculty scholars and
mentor them in environmental health research in collaboration with communities experiencing environmental
injustices in the Southeastern United States (US). In partnership with the Region 4 Southeast Pediatric
Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU), scholars will collaborate with community stakeholders who care
passionately about reducing children’s environmental health inequities. The objectives of the PREHS-SEED
program are to: 1) develop a research training program that produces leaders in pediatric and reproductive
environmental health disparities research; 2) enhance existing infrastructure for individualized didactic training
in research methodology as they relate to pediatric and reproductive environmental health; 3) identify and recruit
a diverse cohort of promising scholars dedicated to careers in pediatric and reproductive environmental health
research from Emory and MSM; and 4) expand existing multidisciplinary career development programs with
mentorship from accomplished environmental health scientists. The Deep South bears the shame of some of
the poorest health outcomes in US, such as high infant and maternal mortality rates among African Americans.
Low-income communities of color face environmental health threats from extreme heat and climate-related
weather events and dangerous air pollution conditions. Inequities are compounded by a legacy of unjust and
systemically racist policies. Thus, priority will be given to scholars who focus on three areas of research: 1)
documenting the burden of environmental health disparities, particularly among Black, Latinx, and
immigrant/refugee women and children; 2) engaging in community-based research with local organizations; and
3) addressing adaptive solutions to climate change. The K12 program will begin in January 2022, providing 1-2
years of release time (75% effort), research funding support, and mentored career development for 6-9 scholars
over 5 years. The program leverages programs at Emory, including the T32 program in Environmental Health
Sciences and Toxicology at the Rollins School of Public Health; the Georgia Clinical & Translational Science
Alliance KL2 program at partner institutions (including Emory and MSM); and the Building Interdisciplinary
Research Careers in Women’s Health program. The PREHS-SEED program will support scholars to advance
the breadth and depth of their research skills with training in clinical studies, team science, community
engagement and novel methodologies (e.g., exposure assessment, toxicology, metabolomics, mapping,
informatics) relevant to environmental health. The intended scholar outcomes are to advance scholars to the
next phase of their academic careers by addressing environmental health disparities in the Southeastern US."

health through enhanced understanding of how climate and oceanic processes affect the intensity and
distribution of toxin-producing HABs and to understand the potential health risks from exposure even to low
levels of their potent neurotoxins, especially during susceptible stages of life. The Center will focus on two key
HAB taxa: Alexandrium catenella, which produces the saxitoxins responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), and Pseudo-nitzschia spp., which produce domoic acid responsible for amnesic shellfish poisoning

approaches developed by the applicants and applied in situ in natural settings have revealed new controls of
A. catenella population dynamics, and have identified possible new climate links regarding toxic Pseudo-
nitzschia species. Project 1 will examine further the physiological and climatic variables affecting these HABs,
which may underlie population adaptation in different habitats and different environmental regimes. Project 2
will incorporate these new and fundamental insights on bloom regulation into coupled climate-population
models to predict HAB threats under future climate scenarios, a key step toward being able to quantify future
risks from this recurrent public health threat. In biomedical studies with the zebrafish model, Project 3 has
identified myelination in the developing brain as a target of domoic acid. They will use transgenic zebrafish and
single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify the cell-specific mechanisms underlying effects of domoic acid,
saxitoxin, and the cyanotoxin anatoxin-a in zebrafish embryos in vivo and will use human iPSC-derived 3D
brain systems in vitro to elucidate toxin effects on neural and glial cell differentiation in human cells. Studies
also will determine whether prior exposure to ubiquitous persistent organic pollutants may modify effects of
subsequent exposure to saxitoxin and domoic acid. All projects will collaborate in modeling to link oceanic
processes to human exposure, helping to define the exposure of susceptible human subpopulations and
predict the effects of a changing climate. The Community Engagement Core will facilitate integration of the
research with education and engagement of resource managers and other stakeholders. We also will improve
awareness of emerging HAB issues for the public health community and develop new educational materials

developed under the current WHCOHH grant, but include new directions and audiences to increase reach and
impact. The CEC will continue to foster communication and data sharing with stakeholders in New England
and will initiate new efforts to promote training and technology transfer. Proposed activities will further the
development and adoption of the WHOI HABhub data portal, an open source webserver that aggregates
diverse HAB data in near real time. New functionality will enable user participation in sensor image
classification, providing all users with deeper engagement and education related to HAB identification and
importance while soliciting meaningful contributions to ongoing research. Our educational outreach will develop
innovative materials and programs to serve as model curricula for teaching OHH concepts and content, with an
emphasis on empowering underserved communities of students. Finally, our efforts to develop effective
involvement of public health and healthcare providers and professionals in OHH address an area of
engagement that has been identified as a priority need for improving the accurate and timely diagnosis and
reporting of illnesses caused by OHH threats. Our efforts are local, regional, and national in scope, and involve
partners with substantial expertise and depth of experience in OHH and community engagement, as well as
the active participation of WHCOHH investigators to promote transparent communications and multi-directional
exchange of information. The CEC plan for evaluation is robust and includes joining with the Administrative
Core to establish a CEC Advisory Committee (CEC-AC) to regularly evaluate CEC progress and success.
Metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of CEC activities will be defined in collaboration with partners and
WHCOHH investigators, and are included in a program logic model for the CEC to evaluate efficacy over time."

Multipotent stem cells in animals integrate information from various extracellular signals to choose between fates.
Signal integration enables robust, context-specific decisions, while errors in this process underlie developmental
disorders and cancers. To be effective, signal integration must be tightly linked to coordination between fates,
i.e., the activation of a target fate program and inactivation of alternative fates. How is this achieved?
 My recent postdoctoral work suggested that, in cultured neural stem cells (NSCs), a gene regulatory
circuit of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors enables the integration of two signals to
simultaneously activate astrocyte differentiation and suppress alternative fates. Transcriptional interactions
among bHLHs are an important component of this circuit, but they alone could not account for signal integration.
 I hypothesize that two other key features of bHLHs play an essential role: protein-level dimerization and
oscillatory dynamics of bHLHs. Here, I will investigate how these features contribute to signal integration by the
NSC circuit using quantitative measurements of dimerization and dynamics complemented by precise
perturbations. Moreover, I will analyze the role of a bHLH circuit in the developing zebrafish spinal cord to
understand how principles of circuit function obtained using in vitro systems extend to an in vivo context.
 In Aim 1, I will investigate the role of bHLH dimerization by designing novel dimerization mutants based
on computational sequence co-evolution analysis (in collaboration with Dr. Debora Marks), validating them using
a quantitative yeast-based measurement platform that I have developed, and analyzing their impact on signal
integration in NSCs. In Aim 2, I will use a combination of timelapse imaging and multiplexed RNA-FISH in NSCs
to analyze how oscillatory dynamics in the bHLH Hes1 is controlled by upstream signals and subsequently
impacts other bHLHs in the circuit as well as downstream fate outcomes. I will also assess how ectopically
modulating Hes1 dynamics affects circuit behavior. In Aim 3, I will determine whether and how a bHLH circuit in
stem cells of the zebrafish neural plate integrates two developmental signals to enable an early fate choice in
this tissue. Specifically, I will first characterize how signaling activity in individual cells impacts their fate using a
combination of in vivo timelapse microscopy and targeted signaling perturbations. I will then investigate how
interactions in the bHLH circuit mediate the effects of signals on fate choice.
 bHLH factors are expressed in most stem cells during development and in adult tissues. bHLH circuits
could therefore play a ubiquitous role in integrating signaling information to enable cell fate decisions. This work
seeks to broadly understand how they function, leveraging quantitative approaches both in vitro and in vivo with
guidance from my mentors Dr. Galit Lahav and Dr. Sean Megason. This investigation will clarify the basis of fate
choice in diverse tissues and provide opportunities to ‘re-wire’ this process to improve the generation of desired
cell types for tissue engineering or to treat pathological fate choices in disease contexts."
10912032,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Despite major advances in therapy, pulmonary disease continues to dominate the clinical course
of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). All patients with CF develop chronic lung infections, with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) becoming a predominant organism in adulthood. Even in the face of
chronic inhalational antibiotic therapy to target Pa in the lungs, CF patients experience intermittent
pulmonary exacerbations with stepwise decline in lung function leading to eventual respiratory failure.
Novel treatment strategies are urgently needed to address the damaging effects of chronic Pa in the
lungs of CF patients. This will allow for all patients with CF to fully benefit of an evolving therapeutic
landscape to address their defective CF gene function.
 I discovered the presence of the Pa filamentous (Pf) bacteriophage, in cohorts of patients with CF
in Stanford and Denmark. Pf was associated with chronicity of Pa and more severe exacerbations
(Burgener et al, Science Translational Medicine 2019). This constituted the first demonstration of the
involvement of bacteriophage in human lung disease. This proposal aims to delve into the mechanisms
behind these associations. Given the known shortcomings of chronic inhalational antibiotic therapy, I
will test the hypothesis that in the lung Pf provides antibiotic tolerance and is a predictive biomarker to
guide in choosing effective inhalational therapeutics. The first aim utilizes banked respiratory Pa
isolates to (1a), assess antibiotic tolerance under conditions present in the lung, (1b) perform whole
genome sequencing to assess for presence of antibiotic resistance genes and (1c) perform evolutionary
experiments to investigate acquisition of resistance as a function of Pf. The second aim will assess Pf
as a lung disease predictive biomarker in (2a) a retrospective cohort evaluating response to
exacerbations therapy and (2b) perform a cross-over clinical trial to assess for differential effects of Pf
on lung function. This proposal, supported by exciting and novel preliminary data, promises to provide
rationale and mechanistic foundation for Pf to be used as a predictive biomarker to guide inhalational
antibiotic choices in CF airway disease management.
 The proposed research draws upon my prior experience in clinical pulmonary medicine and
growing expertise in translational research. Along with my mentors and advisory committee, I present
a comprehensive career development plan for didactics and technical training in microbiology,
genomics, and clinical trial design and biostatistics. This training, along with the clinical studies and
experiments outlined, will allow me to develop skills crucial for my transition to an independent
translational research career focused on bringing new therapies and treatment strategies for
transformative management of CF lung disease."

10913618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
A dire consequence of acute kidney injury (AKI) is a dramatically increased risk to develop chronic kidney disease
(CKD). CKD accounts for 6.7% of Medicare expenses. Understanding the mechanisms by which AKI progresses
to CKD is essential for developing therapies, for which none currently exist. Renal microvasculature, including
pericytes and endothelial cells, are damaged in AKI, leading to recruitment of inflammatory cells which
contributes to progression to CKD. However, cellular, and molecular mechanisms that drive this process are
largely unknown. Pericytes are a heterogeneous mesenchymal population and have been identified as a major
source of myofibroblasts that drives CKD. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that mediates maladaptive
endothelial-pericyte crosstalk leading to exacerbated and prolonged inflammation could drive therapeutic
exploitation of this phenomenon. Previously, it has been shown that the systemic blockade of Vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) blocks CKD progression. My preliminary data, knocking out
VegfR2 in renal stromally derived cells (RSC) (termed VegfR2RSC-/-) that includes pericytes, confirms the
protective nature of this loss-of-function. I found that, in CKD models by renal ischemia/ reperfusion injury (IRI)
as well as by cisplatin, VegfR2RSC-/- mice have attenuated CKD progression, along with having mitigated
inflammation and preserved vascular function. My bulk RNA-sequencing analysis with isolated RSCs
demonstrates that inflammatory pathways are activated while short-chain fatty acid metabolism pathways are
suppressed during AKI-to-CKD transition. Mechanistically, VegfR2RSC-/- kidneys (1) have reduced expression of
a pro-inflammatory signaling axis of Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)/ CD148, and (2) have increased expression of
fatty acid metabolism associated genes contributing to the enhanced protection. To home in on the timing of the
protection, I have generated a tamoxifen-inducible RSC-specific VegfR2 knockout (iVegfR2RSC-/-) mouse. I found
that, after pre-treatment of tamoxifen, iVegfR2RSC-/- mice are significantly protected against AKI. Together, these
data informed my overarching hypothesis that renal pericyte-specific VEGF-R2 signaling dysregulates pericyte-
endothelial crosstalk stimulating inflammation to exacerbate CKD. I propose the following aims to test this: Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that pericyte-specific VEGF-R2 signaling exacerbates AKI-to-CKD transition. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that pericyte VEGF-R2 signaling mediates maladaptive pericyte-endothelial crosstalk to
exacerbate inflammation, promoting AKI-to-CKD. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that inhibiting VegfR2 signaling
in renal pericytes enhances vascular repair, mitigates inflammation, and blocks progression to CKD after AKI.
For the K01 Award, I enlisted innovative mentors. The University of Pittsburgh has an extraordinary number of
faculty with research programs focused on AKI, and on vascular medicine. Successful completion of these
studies will shed light on how renal pericyte specific VEGF-R2 signaling exacerbates CKD progression."

Biofilms are intrinsically drug-resistant. While the signaling pathways mediating resistance in biofilms are documented,
only recently has the importance of electrophysiology in modifying gentamicin resistance come to light. However, the role
of electrophysiology in biofilm formation and maturation is unknown. Furthermore, we currently lack high throughput
screening techniques for assessing the bactericidal potential of treatment strategies against clinical biofilms.
During my K99 training, I will investigate how mechanically-stimulated calcium fluctuations modify the c-di-GMP pools
(Aim 1.1) and bacterial swarming (Aim 1.2) leading to biofilm formation. Concomitantly, I will deploy an assay for measur-
ing biofilm viability in high throughput to screen for antibiotic adjuvants against biofilms (Aim 2.1). During this phase, my
training will focus on the culture of biofilms, analysis of non-optical electrophysiology data, and building machine learning
models subsequently applied during my R00 phase.
Following my K99 phase, I will investigate the electrophysiology of mature biofilms using both optical and non-optical
techniques and correlate changes in antibiotic tolerance across the biofilm life-cycle with changes in electrophysiology (Aim
1.3). Concomitantly, I will build and train deep learning models to predict gentamicin adjuvants against slow-growing cells
based on viability data collected in my K99 phase (Aim 2.2).
The product of my project will enrich our understanding of biofilm electrophysiology and enable methods for mitigating
their formation or promoting their retention as is desirable for probiotics. Additionally, this work will deliver new machine
learning technologies for finding antibiotic adjuvants to combat drug-resistant clinical biofilms."
10847462,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT – Defining a type II IL-9R
 Cells communicate through specific cytokine-receptor binding to mediate immune responses and
inflammation. Targeting these interactions has become an effective approach to patient treatment in a growing
list of diseases. Among the cytokines, IL-9 is pleiotropic and is involved in allergic and autoimmune diseases
and in tumor immunity. In hematopoietic cells IL-9 signals through the IL-9Rα chain and the γc chain that is
shared with other cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-7. Numerous reports, including our own, demonstrate the
ability of IL-9 to stimulate direct effects in non-hematopoietic cells as well. Yet, the hematopoietic-restricted
expression of γc leaves a gap in our knowledge of how IL-9 delivers a signal to non-hematopoietic cells. The
related cytokine IL-4 has a type II receptor that is composed of the IL-4Rα chain and the IL-13Rα1 chain to
facilitate responses in non-hematopoietic cells. In this application we provide evidence of a type II IL-9R that is
proposed to function in non-hematopoietic cells. We hypothesize that on airway epithelial cells IL-9Rα can
combine with IL-13Rα1 to form a type II receptor and we provide preliminary data of a physical interaction
between these receptor chains. We will test this hypothesis using gene-targeted mice and both in vitro and in
vivo model systems to analyze IL-9 signaling and IL-9 function in airway epithelial cells. Together, these studies
will expand the paradigm of cytokine receptor biology, provide detailed insight into IL-9 effector functions, and
further define how targeting cytokine receptor chains impacts immunity in the patient population."

Control of the redox homeostasis is essential to cancer cell proliferation and requires the delicate maintenance
of oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways. This equilibrium is controlled by signal transduction pathways
and imbalances lead to redox stress that potently blocks cancer growth. Much work has focused on the role of
oxidative stress in cancer proliferation, however, the converse– reductive stress and its impact on malignant
cells is poorly understood. We have studied the role of redox control in cancer in the context of modification of
proteinaceous cysteines by reactive oxygen species and the NRF2 transcription factor pathway. NRF2 functions
as the master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response and promotes the expression of key metabolic and
detoxification genes to generate a reductive environment and negate oxidative stress. NRF2 is activated in many
cancers including ~30% of non small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) through mutation of its negative regulator
KEAP1. While NRF2 has been extensively studied in KEAP1-mutant NSCLCs, we wondered what role this
pathway plays in the proliferation of NSCLC cell lines which are wildtype (WT) for KEAP1. To this end, we
pharmacologically activated NRF2 in 50+ NSCLC cell lines (WT for KEAP1) and measured their proliferation.
Unexpectedly, we find that in ~16% of NSCLC cell lines, NRF2 activation results in a severe block in proliferation.
A genome wide CRISPR screen identifies that genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial fusion
and the electron transport chain (ETC) are major sensitizers to NRF2 activation when lost and can function as
companion biomarkers for NRF2-sensitivity. In line with the generation of reductive stress following NRF2
activation, key cysteines on enzymes involved in mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial fusion are reduced
as determined by chemical proteomic platforms. To explain these surprising biological characteristics we
propose the following hypothesis: NRF2 activation in a subset of NSCLC cell lines promotes an overly reductive
environment that decreases the activity of key enzymes in mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial
respiration and fusion. The inactivation of these pathways synergize to block cell growth. In this grant application,
we build on our research surrounding NRF2 sensitization and mechanistically characterize the role of reductive
stress in NSCLC proliferation. In this grant application, we will comprehensively define KEAP1-dependence by
identifying NRF2 regulation of mitochondrial metabolism/fusion at the protein, cellular and organismal levels.
The research proposed herein, takes full advantage of a series of recently conceived methods: chemical
proteomics, genome-wide CRISPR screens and untargeted metabolomics, which have previously been
deployed in isolation, to be used in an integrated manner to effectively dissect how protein reduction underlies
protein malfunction and KEAP1-dependence. These studies will not only provide a comprehensive
understanding of NRF2/KEAP1 biology but may also lay the foundation for developing translational therapeutics
to benefit lung cancer patients with deregulated NRF2 signaling."
10741794,"Signal transducers and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is frequently activated in human cancers and
aberrant activation of STAT3 signaling is involved in tumor initiation, progression, drug resistance and immune
evasion. Thus, STAT3 has been considered to be a highly attractive cancer therapeutic target. However,
discovery and development of highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors of STAT3 have proven to
be very challenging for a number of reasons.
 The proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) strategy has recently gained tremendous momentum for its
promise for the discovery and development of an entirely different type of new therapeutics through inducing
targeted protein degradation. We hypothesize that PROTAC STAT3 degraders (hereafter called STAT3
degraders) may be much more effective than STAT3 inhibitors in inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity.
To date, no STAT3 degraders have been reported.
 Based upon a class of highly potent STAT3 inhibitors, we have designed and developed the first-in-class
STAT3 degraders, as exemplified by our lead compound SD-36. SD-36 is highly potent and effective in
inducing the degradation of STAT3 protein and demonstrates an absolute selectivity over other STAT
members and all other >5,000 proteins examined. Degradation of STAT3 by SD-36 results in a robust
suppression of STAT3 transcription activity and down-regulation of STAT3 transcription network in tumor
cells. Our initial screening demonstrated that SD-36 inhibits the growth of a subset of AML and ALCL cell lines
that express high levels of p-STAT3 (Y705). Our pharmacodynamic (PD) studies showed that a single
intravenous administration of SD-36 is capable of reducing STAT3 protein by >90%, with the effect persisted
for more than 3 days. SD-36 achieves complete tumor regression in multiple xenograft models in mice at well
tolerate doss-schedules. Our data demonstrate that degradation of STAT3 protein is a highly promising
cancer therapeutic strategy.
 Based upon our compelling preliminary data, we propose to design, synthesize and develop highly potent
small-molecule STAT3 degraders as a new class of therapies for the treatment of human cancer and to
elucidate their mechanism of action. In addition to performance of extensive evaluations of SD-36 in vitro and
in vivo, we will further optimize SD-36 for potency and efficacy and address any weaknesses we uncover for
SD-36. Our goal is to select one or more highly potent and optimized STAT3 degrader for advanced
preclinical development for the treatment of human cancers with activated STAT3."

Suicide rates continue to increase in every age group in the United States and in almost every state—in 2016,
44,965 individuals in the US died by suicide. Developing scientifically rigorous surveillance, reporting, and
forecasting systems for suicide is essential to craft appropriate public health responses. Here we will bring
together geo-located data from Google Extended Trends, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Health Cost and
Utilization Project, and vital statistics coupled with the National Violent Death Registry to build and validate
statistical and mathematical models of queries, calls, attempts, and completions of suicide. Our models aim to
address the epidemic by studying it as a communicable process. Our overarching goal is to provide an
anticipatory warning system to inform school-based and community-based prevention and treatment capacity.
Our first Aim is to estimate how suicidal queries, calls, attempts, and completions cluster in space and time.
Temporal and spatial autocorrelation of suicidal behavior shares many features with communicable diseases
that can be conceptualized in terms of the epidemiological triad—agent (media reporting, person-to-person
transmission, lethal vectors), host (history of attempts and psychiatric disorder), and environment (weather,
elevation, and temperature)—for which rigorous statistical models have been used to study geographic and
temporal risk factors associated with infectious disease, even in the face of incomplete surveillance data. We
will estimate the unique and shared autocorrelation of suicide queries, calls, attempts, and completions and
test the extent to which autocorrelation varies by developmental stage (i.e., adolescents and young adults
versus older adults). Our second Aim is to understand the dynamics of suicide risk across developmental
stages through simulation of anomalous suicidal outbreaks using mathematical models that represent suicide
as a contagion. The models will be coupled with Bayesian inference algorithms to enable simulation,
optimization, and estimation of key epidemiological parameters that characterize system dynamics. This effort
will bring together 4 data sources (queries, calls, attempts, and completions) to consider the system as a
whole, rather than as separate streams of information. We will answer critical questions about the extent to
which local and temporal anomalous increases in suicidal outcomes vary across events, as well as the force of
contagious transmission, length of time of contagious suicidal crises, and contribution of lethal means. For our
third Aim, we will use the model-inference framework to produce granular, local, 6-month predictions of suicide
outbreak events. The generated forecasts will help inform when, where, and among whom we can expect
suicide outbreaks to develop, and for how long unless prevention efforts are rapidly disseminated. This project
brings together experts in mathematical modeling, communicable disease and suicide epidemiology,
prevention, and intervention, who will apply state-of-the-art modeling approaches to suicide surveillance and
forecasting."

Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is a protein posttranslational modification (PTM) that is catalyzed by a
family of enzymes called Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs). Among the various PARP enzymes, PARP1
is a nuclear protein that is critically involved in cell stress responses. In response to genotoxic stress, PARP1
binds to nicked DNA and is rapidly activated, resulting in the synthesis of a large number of PARylated proteins
and initiation of the DNA damage repair (DDR) mechanisms. Indeed, four PARP1 inhibitors have recently been
approved by the FDA to treat BRCA-mutated ovarian and/or breast cancers. Besides the role in regulating
DDR in the context of human malignancies, recent evidence suggests that PARylation serves as a death signal
in neurons. Importantly, genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PARP1 offers profound protection
against brain dysfunction in the animal models of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ALS and frontotemporal dementia/FTD. PARP1 is
directly activated by a variety of neurotoxic stimulants (e.g., pathologic protein aggregates), and aberrant
PARylation promotes the formation of biomolecular condensates. Despite the established role of PARylation in
the regulation of phase-transition, the structural aspects of this process are elusive. To address this, we will
leverage our published work and the extensive experience of my lab. These preliminary data are largely
focused on two different programs. First, PARylation is a notorious PTM for mass spectrometrists, because of
its labile and heterogenous nature. We recently were able to overcome these challenges, and develop a large-
scale mass spectrometric approach towards comprehensive characterization of the Asp- and Glu-PARylated
proteome. Using this approach, we have defined the global PARylated proteome under various genotoxic
conditions. Second, biomolecular condensates are a class of membrane-less organelles, whose structural
dynamics are less amenable to traditional biophysical tools. To address this, we previously developed a mass
spectrometry-based chemical “footprinting” method for the structural analysis of these protein fibrils. Based on
these results, we will develop a novel, tunable footprinting approach for the characterization of the structural
dynamics of biomolecular condensates that are relevant to ALS and FTD (Aim 1). Then we will use tunable
footprinting to study how PARylation regulates phase-transition in vitro (Aim 2). Finally, we will use tunable
footprinting to characterize PARylation-mediated phase-transition in induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived
neurons (iPSN) and fly models of C9orf72-mediated ALS and FTD (Aim 3). The information garnered from
these studies will provide a fundamental understanding of this critical biological process, paving the way for
targeting PARP1 for the treatment of ALS and FTD, and more broadly, Alzheimer's disease related dementias."

Children with Crohn’s disease (CD) often have low bone mineral density (BMD) and altered bone structure,
resulting in increased skeletal fragility. While bone formation is compromised in pediatric and adolescent patients
at diagnosis with CD, the factors mediating these disease-related complications remain poorly understood and
represent a critical opportunity to identify proactive measures and therapies for young patients with CD. The
majority of bone mass is acquired by late adolescence through the acceleration of bone turnover, including bone
formation and resorption. A failure to achieve peak bone mass increases the lifetime risk of osteoporosis.
Hematopoietic (red) bone marrow converts to lipid-rich (yellow) marrow during normal skeletal development in
healthy children and adolescents. Conditions that accelerate the conversion of premature red to yellow marrow
- and possibly its reversibility - are central to the deficits in bone health in youth with CD. The presence of
increased marrow fat in adolescents and adults is associated with reduced biomechanical strength, with
implications for fracture risk. In other pediatric diseases, the hormonal milieu can alter mesenchymal stem cells
to differentiate preferentially into adipocytes over osteoblasts, compromising osteogenesis. We will examine
adolescents with newly-diagnosed CD at baseline and one year later to evaluate the impact of CD inflammatory
activity on marrow fat, BMD, bone turnover markers, and to correlate with peripheral blood immune parameters.
This project is a prospective, longitudinal, case-control study with the following aims: (1) Using magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and peripheral quantitative computed
tomography (pQCT), evaluate bone marrow composition, areal and volumetric BMD in adolescents with newly-
diagnosed CD and compare to healthy matched controls; (2) Examine changes in marrow fat and BMD at one
year after diagnosis, across patients with CD versus in healthy matched controls, and investigate the
associations between marrow fat, BMD, and body composition; and (3) To evaluate the mechanism of
compromised bone formation in patients with CD, we will investigate bone turnover markers and immune
cellular/molecular parameters and their associations with BMD and marrow fat.

10890152,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) affects an estimated 17% of adolescents worldwide. Earlier onset in
adolescence is linked to more severe trajectories of NSSI, suicide plans, and poorer quality of life. Though
early intervention for NSSI is critical, most adolescents with NSSI do not seek professional help, and many do
not self-disclose their behaviors to anyone in person, limiting access to support and preventing pathways to
treatment. While several psychological interventions have been effective in reducing adolescent NSSI,
structural barriers (e.g., time, cost), attitudinal barriers (e.g., stigma, mental health literacy), and the prevalence
of non-disclosure constrain their accessibility and reach. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) present an
opportunity to reach this high-risk and non-treatment-engaged population and increase their access to
evidence-based psychological strategies. Indeed, adolescents report receptivity to digital interventions and
engage in NSSI help-seeking online at high rates. However, to date there are no publicly available DMHIs
designed to support this adolescent population. In collaboration with Mental Health America (MHA), the
nation's largest mental health advocacy organization, the proposed K01 application will address this gap by
designing and evaluating a DMHI attuned to the unique needs and preferences of adolescents (14-17 years)
who engage in NSSI. This project will leverage a moment of online information-seeking through MHA's
website, to deliver a low-intensity DMHI focused on acquisition and practice of evidence-based skills to
improve self-regulation and deliver help-seeking information, to ultimately reduce NSSI frequency and
encourage future treatment engagement. Partnering with MHA to deliver the DMHI provides a clear
dissemination pathway and access to a diverse group of adolescents who are not in treatment. To design the
DMHI, I will employ user-centered design activities, which involve key stakeholders in the research and design
process to ensure adolescents' needs and preferences are reflected in the final DMHI. I will also engage MHA
stakeholders in the development of a strategic implementation and dissemination plan through their website. I
will then pilot a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the DMHI with 80 adolescents (14-17 years of age)
randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive the DMHI (n=40) or an active psychoeducational control (n=40) for the
duration of 8 weeks. This K01 will be a critical first step in positioning me to achieve my career goal and
become a leading independent researcher in digital mental health. My four training aims are designed to
support this overarching goal by extending my expertise in: 1) UCD and summative methods including usability
testing for DMHIs and support further development of expertise in 2) the conduct of clinical trials, 3) scalable
implementation methodologies, and 4) treatment models for adolescent NSSI. Accomplishment of these
training goals and the proposed research project will provide the skills necessary for the development of an
R01 of a fully powered hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial testing the efficacy of the DMHI."
10933545,"Project Summary
There is an urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors and intervention approaches that would help to
prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). In this regard, several researchers propose that
prosocial engagement via helping others should be considered a public health intervention for tackling the AD
epidemic. This perspective is based on the accumulated evidence demonstrating how formal volunteering
confers a wide range of health benefits for the volunteer, in part through influencing neurobiological systems
that also influence AD risk. Although recent reviews indicate inconclusive evidence, a small but growing body
of correlational evidence for the link between volunteering and cognitive outcomes is corroborated by findings
from randomized control trials, such as the Baltimore Experience Corps. However, earlier studies on prosocial
helping behaviors in later life mostly focused on formal volunteering, while little is known about the cognitive
benefits of informal helping given directly to non-household individuals in the community, which may be more
relevant for African and Hispanic Americans with a richer tradition of informally serving their communities.
 The overarching goal of the project is to uncover robust evidence linking two forms of helping behaviors
(i.e., formal volunteering, and informal helping) and better cognitive functioning so as to establish prosocial
engagement as a health behavior that could reduce the risk or delay the onset of AD. Taking advantage of the
rich longitudinal data from the NIA-funded Health and Retirement Study (1998-2020), we address the
following key aims. First, we identify the extent to which helping behaviors promote higher levels of cognitive
functioning and slower cognitive decline while paying close attention to potential racial-ethnic differences for
the link between the type of helping and cognitive outcomes. We employ the recently-proposed asymmetric
modeling approach to accurately estimate the within-person effects of transitioning into (and out of) helping
behaviors. Subsequently, we disentangle rapid cognitive decline driven by genetic risk factors for developing
AD from normal, age-related changes in cognitive functioning and identify the dose-response of helping
needed to alleviate cognitive decline accelerated by high genetic AD risk. Finally, we situate the helping-
cognition nexus within the neighborhood context in which helping behaviors often take place and investigate
the extent to which helping others buffers detrimental effects of disadvantaged and/or deteriorating
neighborhood socioeconomic status, assessed with Census-tract level data. The research team includes a new
investigator and four consultants with expertise covering all facets of the proposed project, and thus the team is
well-suited to successfully address the innovative set of project aims. The project is expected to yield high
reward outcomes not only in terms of contributing to the scientific literature but also for developing strategies
for effective, evidence-driven community-based AD intervention programs, an urgent priority of NIA."
10873797,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
There are 13 cancer subtypes that are linked to obesity and these account for 40% of all cancers diagnosed in
the United States annually. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations are 1.6 times more likely to be
obese than the general population. Many factors influence this elevated risk including poverty, nontraditional
foods, related social determinants of health, and physical inactivity. Furthermore, AI/AN people have the worst
cancer survival rates of any US racial group. Obesity-related inflammation likely drives cancer risk and adverse
outcomes, and yet, this is a reversible process. AI/AN are known to be underrepresented in clinical trials and
research, and even more importantly, they have never been included in an intervention designed to modulate
inflammation prior to cancer surgery. A small handful of studies in non-AI/AN featuring lifestyle interventions
following diagnosis of obesity-related cancer and implemented during the short window of opportunity (WOO)
before cancer surgery, a strategy known as prehabilitation (prehab), have shown some significant findings.
These include alterations in the expression levels of inflammatory markers in serum and the tumor
microenvironment (TME), factors that may influence carcinogenesis. Given the higher prevalence of obesity
and worse cancer outcomes, the AI/AN population may have the greatest gains from this line of research. We
hypothesize that a prehab intervention modeled after published literature then adapted with community
collaboration for AI cancer patients will be feasible, acceptable, and successful at modulating inflammatory
biomarkers. The proposed project is to (1) complete the adaptation of a prehab intervention using the
candidate’s preliminary research, (2) implement the prehab translational clinical trial for AI patients with
obesity-related solid tumor cancer preparing for surgery, and (3) measure inflammatory biomarkers pre and
post-intervention to assess responsiveness. Study outcomes include pre and post comparisons of serum
biomarkers (insulin, leptin, hsCRP, IL-6, TNFα, cortisol AM, prealbumin); tissue biomarkers (Ki67, insulin
receptor, TNFα, NFκB, NOS2, cleaved caspase-3); anthropometric measurements (blood pressure, weight,
waist circumference); lifestyle behavioral measures (validated diet/exercise tools: REAPS, IPAQ, 6MWT, STS).
The proposed training plan builds on the applicant’s background in surgical oncology, public health, and AI/AN
cancer disparities to include new training in (a) clinical trial design and implementation, (b) biomarker
measurement and (c) professional development. The rigorous research and training strategies will promote the
candidate’s goal of successfully transforming into an independent, funded translational clinical trialist working
on behalf of AI/AN to narrow cancer disparities. This will be achieved with the support of a highly experienced
mentorship team and the well-resourced training environment of The University of Arizona, an AI/AN-serving
institution and home to the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the state of Arizona."
10931562,"TITLE: Targeting P2RX7 Signaling as a Biomarker for ADRD
ABSTRACT
Inflammation in the brain has been proposed to be an early predictor for a range of neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias, Parkinson’s disease, ischemia-reperfusion injury,
epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and traumatic brain injury. Identification and development of biomarkers
of neuroinflammation would permit researchers and clinicians to identify “at risk” subjects for these disorders,
evaluate severity of disease stage, and effectiveness of possible treatments. Previous work on imaging agents
to monitor neuroinflammation has resulted in sub-optimal radiopharmaceuticals that are only correlative in
nature. To overcome these limitations, we propose to target the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) found within the central
nervous system and expressed primarily on immune cells. These receptors become activated in
neurodegenerative diseases, and are an ideal target to monitor disease progression and therapy response.
Previous efforts to develop ligands against this target have been stymied by the presence of P451L mutations
that cause dysfunctional P2X7R signaling commonly used animal models. Recent development and
characterization of a wild-derived mouse panel showed a high degree of overlap with human neuroinflammation,
which is likely due to the retention of functional P2X7R, making them an ideal tool to advance ligands against
this receptor. We hypothesize that neuroinflammation is a major initiator of neurodegenerative disease,
where P2X7 receptors play a central role; and that developing a novel PET tracer against this receptor
will enable phenotypic and therapeutic assessment during aging. Our goal is to characterize the third
generation agent (i.e. [18F]GSK1482160) in human cell based assays, and in acute and chronic
neuroinflammation models. In Aim 1, we will characterize [18F]-GSK14821604 in vitro in human iPSC derived
microglia expressing human P2X7R (hP2X7R) in the APOEE3/E3 or APOEE4/E4 to understand: a) the radioligand
depletion conditions for Ki (Aim 1.1); b) binding kinetics for kon, koff, Kd, Bmax (Aim 1.2), and Bp via saturation and
association/dissociation kinetics (Aim 1.3). To understand the role of P2X7R in acute and chronic
neuroinflammation, in Aim 2, we will use dynamic PET/CT in cross-sectional cohorts of female CAST/EiJ,
PWK/PhJ, PWK.APP/PS1 and CAST.APP/PS1 mice. Using dynamic PET/CT we will determine the role of acute
(Aim 2.2) and chronic (Aim 2.4) inflammation, where biodistribution (Aim 2.3), thus permitting allometric organ
dosimetry for first in human studies. In addition, to validate the sensitivity and specificity of this ligand, (Aim 2.5)
dynamic [18F]-GSK1482160 PET/CT at peak P2X7R expression will be conducted, allowing determination of
maximum (CAST.APP/PS1) and non-specific (CAST.APP/PS1P2X7R-/-) binding relative to homeostatic levels of
microglia (CAST/EiJ). Lastly, to establish test-retest reliability (Aim 2.6) we will repeat imaging in the same
subjects separated by 1 week. In all cases, post-mortem brains will undergo Autorad and IHC ex vivo for
confirmation. Combined these data will support first in human imaging studies in collaboration with the ADNI."
10732089,"Project Summary
Alexandrium catenella and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. threaten human health through their production of potent
neurotoxins that respectively cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning. Both are
widespread across coastal waters of the U.S. and globally. Climate change is altering marine ecosystems in
many unanticipated ways, and a major concern is that the occurrence of these harmful algal blooms (HABs)
and their concomitant human health impacts will grow. This project addresses key uncertainties regarding the
impact of climate change on the timing and severity of HABs through detailed biological and ecological study of
Alexandrium and Pseudo-nitzschia blooms within the Gulf of Maine (GOM). The GOM is an ideal system not
only because of already observed impacts from climate change, but also the long history of regional HAB
issues and associated groundbreaking research by WHCOHH. Comprehensive studies of bloom physiology,
toxicity, and oceanographic drivers have led to construction of coupled physical-biological models that have
improved our understanding of key HAB dynamics and set the stage for continued interdisciplinary
investigation of mechanisms at the cellular-to-GOM scale that are relevant to human exposure and health. In
particular, the physiological responses of these HABs — growth, toxicity, and life cycle transitions — to shifting
environmental conditions remain uncertain. We hypothesize that long-term HAB trends in the GOM are
inherently linked to interactions between the environment and cells' physiological processes, particularly
transitions between sexual and asexual life cycle stages. Studies within this project aim to directly observe life
cycle processes and other physiological responses that are often highly ephemeral in situ. We apply a wide
variety of innovative approaches for study of natural bloom populations, leveraging a unique region-scale HAB
observing system (HABON-NE). Aims 1 and 2 focus on A. catenella and seek to characterize cyst dormancy
cycles, cyst formation, and subsequent bloom termination. These aims build upon prior successful approaches
and models from study of inshore systems, asking the question if open water populations of the GOM are
governed by similar dynamics. Aim 3 investigates the physiology underlying the emerging bloom dynamics of
Pseudo-nitzschia in the GOM with in situ physiological observation coupled with targeted metatranscriptomics.
Through the direct assessment of life cycle processes and physiology of HABs in the GOM, the results from
this work will be directly applicable to the successful integration of physiology into climate response projections
(Project 2) and inform estimates of potential risk for human exposure to HAB toxins (Project 3)."
10732090,"1. Summary / Abstract
Our goal is to understand and predict how climate variability influences harmful algal bloom (HAB) dynamics
and exposure of human populations to HAB toxins, with implications for human health. We hypothesize that
climate-induced environmental changes will influence the composition, distribution, and severity of HABs in
ways that are predictable based on response to previous climate forcing. Our studies will focus on the
dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella and diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia, organisms that produce
saxitoxin and domoic acid, respectively. Focusing on the Gulf of Maine (GOM), we will construct hindcast
simulations based on dynamically downscaled climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), into which a revised model of A. catenella model and a to-be-developed model of
Pseudo-nitzschia spp. will be incorporated. The A. catenella model revisions will incorporate the latest
advances in how cyst germination and loss processes affect bloom timing and development. Hindcasts will be
evaluated against climate data records assembled herein, documenting fluctuations in abundance of the target
species as well as toxicity (toxin accumulation) in coastal shellfish resources. A submodel will be developed to
estimate human exposure to these toxins. Discrepancies between the hindcasts and observations will guide
iterative model improvement. Once satisfactory agreement has been achieved, the models will be run in
forecast mode with various climate change scenarios. We will also assess potential climate impacts on HAB
dynamics in two other model systems: a temperate embayment with Nauset Marsh (NM) and the coastal
Arctic. The proposed research will be integrated into the WHCOHH in several ways: (1) what is learned about
bloom dynamics in Project 1 will be used to improve HAB models; (2) development of the exposure submodel
will be undertaken in collaboration with Project 3; (3) all three projects will participate in the analysis of climate-
forced variations in HABs and how they affect human exposure to toxins; and (4) results will be communicated
through the Community Engagement Core."
10732091,"The overall objective of the proposed research is to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of toxicity
from developmental exposure to harmful algal bloom (HAB) toxins. The HAB toxins domoic acid (DA), saxitoxin
(STX), and anatoxin-a (ATX-a) occur in marine and coastal water bodies as well as in food sources and pose a
significant threat to public health. Current regulatory guidelines for HAB toxins in seafood are designed to
protect against acute exposure to adults. However, seafood with HAB toxins below the regulatory limits is
regularly harvested and the consequences of exposure to low levels of HAB toxins particularly to children and
young adults are not well understood. It is well known that the early life environment can profoundly influence
health throughout the life course (the developmental origins of health and disease concept). The central
hypothesis of the proposed research is that exposure to HAB toxins during early development alters various
neuronal and glial cell types independently, leading to cell-type specific transcriptional changes, ultimately
contributing to altered neurobehavioral outcomes. We propose to test this hypothesis using two
complementary model systems: zebrafish, an established model organism for characterizing molecular,
cellular, and behavioral changes in vivo, and human iPSC-derived 3D brain systems in vitro for elucidating the
effects of toxins on differentiating human neural cells. In Aim 1, we will use transgenic zebrafish embryos and
single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
neurodevelopmental toxicity of DA, STX, and ATX-a. Building on our previous studies, in Aim 1.1 we will test
the hypothesis that DA exposure of zebrafish embryos affects oligodendrocyte-neuron interactions in part by
targeting oligodendrocytes that are necessary for the maturation and survival of axons. In Aim 1.2, we will test
the hypothesis that STX exposure during development alters extracellular matrix at the synapses in the brain,
with impacts on neural circuit formation in larvae. In Aim 1.3, we will test the hypothesis that developmental
exposure of zebrafish embryos to ATX-a causes nervous system deficits by activating nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors. In Aim 2, using human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, we will investigate the effects on exposure
to HAB toxins on mechanisms of neuronal and glial cell differentiation. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that
combined early life and preconceptional exposure to low levels of PCBs influences the responses to HAB
toxins. In Aim 4, we will use probabilistic models to assess human exposure to DA during susceptible windows
of development and collaborate with Project 1, 2 and CEC to use coupled HAB biophysical models and
exposure models to predict the impact of climate change on human exposure to STX and DA. Overall, the
results from this research will contribute to improved understanding of the potential health consequences of
developmental exposure to HAB toxins in humans, critical for assessing public health risks associated with the
possibly increasing exposure to these toxins."
10722799,"Project Abstract
Protein kinases constitute one of the largest enzyme families in humans, and their aberrant and carcinogenic
function in a vast array of cancers is well known. However, despite the now known inherent druggability of this
enzyme class, only approximately two dozen kinases have been successfully exploited as drug targets,
highlighting the need for major innovations for functional characterization and drug discovery. Moreover, nearly
200 kinases remain poorly/completely understudied at this time, and they can be considered as the ‘dark
kinome,’ due to a lack of sensitive measurement platforms for their investigation.
 The goal of this proposal is to develop next-generation sample multiplexing-based proteomics
technologies to transform kinome research. Accomplishing this goal will allow us to reliably measure relative
and absolute kinase abundance across hundreds of cancer samples, shed light on their functions, elucidate
mechanisms underlying kinase inhibitor resistance, and identify compounds as potential kinase degraders.
Specifically, I propose to i) develop a targeted kinome assay to enable simultaneous absolute and relative
quantification of the full human kinome (Aim 1), ii) develop a streamlined platform incorporating automated
sample preparation to enable high-throughput kinome-focused compound library screening (Aim 2), and iii)
perform compound library screening to identify new kinase degraders (Aim 3). The end result from the
proposed studies will be an integrated paradigm-shifting platform to elevate human kinome research. I note
that the platform can easily be adapted to characterize other entire protein categories (e.g., transcription
factors) that are relevant to cancer pathology. Moreover, the data from this application will generate multiple
first-of-their-kind resources, including a kinome expression map across different human cancer cell lines, a
kinome response map of known kinase inhibitors, and a kinase degradation map with compound libraries.
 This proposal draws on my training in chemistry, proteomics, and bioinformatics. During my
postdoctoral research, I have successfully applied my knowledge to understand a variety of biological and
pathological processes, including platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, tissue-specific machinery in aging, impact
of genetic variation on protein expression and lipid metabolism, and amyloid precursor protein processing in
endo-lysosomal system. As cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, my career goal is to
develop a research program with the focus on mechanistic understanding of cancer, and therapeutic
development for its treatment. I aim to become a leader in kinase biology using proteomics and chemical
biology approaches, which will distinguish my independent work from that of my mentors."
10909365,"This application will combine the neuroimaging expertise of the investigator with new knowledge of biomarkers
for aging pathology, advanced computational methods and Down syndrome clinical translational research. The
goal is to produce a unique skill set which will be used to advance the candidate’s career as an independent
lifespan developmental cognitive neuroscientist focusing on Down syndrome. Neurodegenerative changes
associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are present in almost all individuals with Down syndrome by age 40
years, and the lifetime risk of developing dementia is more than 90% in this population. Understanding patterns
of neuropsychiatric and pathological brain changes before AD diagnosis is critical in order to facilitate
interventions prior to onset of irreversible neuropsychiatric and pathological brain changes. Yet charting of
pathological brain changes and diagnosis of dementia is extremely challenging in individuals with DS who have
brain and neuropsychological differences present through the lifespan. Here we propose a computational
neuroscientific framework in which we will utilize conventional resting state functional MRI, advanced
quantitative MRI and multimodal biomarker data to disentangle brain and neuropsychological changes specific
to DS and AD (within the context of DS). Specifically, we will test the overarching hypothesis that whole brain
connectivity (i.e. connectomes based on resting state functional MRI) and brain microstructure (quantitative
MRI) represent intermediate phenotypes between primary brain pathologies and neuropsychological outcomes
in DS and AD. First, we will leverage data from the Alzheimer's Biomarkers Consortium — Down Syndrome
(ABC-DS) to identify connectome-wide signatures specific to DS, and a separate set of signatures specific to
AD in the context of DS. Then, we will examine relationships between connectome-wide signatures and AD
pathology within the amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration (ATN) framework. Next, we will examine relationships
between connectome-wide signatures and critical neuropsychological functions including memory, social
cognition, and executive function dimensionally. Finally, we will enroll a novel cohort of adults with DS and
collect complementary advanced MRI studies (not available in ABC-DS) and fluid biomarkers, to examine brain
microstructural properties which may be more a) sensitive to neurodegenerative changes when compared to
traditional MRI and b) complementary to PET imaging. Together, the results of this proposal will advance a
mechanistic understanding of DS- and AD-specific pathological brain changes and how reorganization of
functional networks relate to neuropsychological changes. Further, these data form the basis for a follow-up
R01 combining ABC-DS emerging longitudinal data with advanced complementary MRI and multimodal
biomarkers."
10911335,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Despite the landmark approval of anti-PD1 therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the majority of
patients still progress. Compensatory activation of lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), to suppress T cell
activation is an established mechanism of resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in cancer. Our recent work suggests
that IL-6 is an upstream inducer of LAG3 in patients with NSCLC. We have demonstrated an association
between IL-6 and STAT3 activation and decreased response in patients with NSCLC receiving anti-PD-1
therapy. However, we do not know (1) the mechanism of IL-6-induced LAG3 expression which leads to anti-
PD-1 resistance, or (2) if IL-6 blockade prevents T cell dysfunction in vivo. This proposal hypothesizes that (1)
increased plasma IL-6 induces LAG3 expression via STAT3 activation in peripheral CD8+ T cells leading to T
cell dysfunction and decreased response to anti-PD-1 therapy in patients; and (2) LAG3-mediated T cell
dysfunction can be rescued with IL-6 blockade in vivo. This proposal will significantly impact future studies
regarding immunotherapy resistance in cancer. Specifically, this project will inform our understanding of a
novel IL-6-induced LAG3 mediated mechanism of anti-PD-1 resistance and will serve as the pre-clinical
rationale for investigating the combination of IL6/STAT3 inhibition and PD-1 blockade in an early phase clinical
trial for patients with advanced NSCLC. This proposal will provide Dr. Somasundaram with the opportunity to
continue work with (i) animal models (design and oversee murine models), (ii) quantify changes in tumor size,
volume and number in mice, and (iii) evaluate the immune landscape in murine T cells by
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry, and RNA sequencing (RNAseq). He will continue his current
work with patient samples also. These skills will be reinforced by a team of mentors, advisors, collaborators,
and core resources available at the University of North Carolina and the University of Pittsburgh. The primary
mentor, Dr. Jonathan Serody, is an internationally recognized, NIH R01-funded scientist with 28 years of
experience in tumor immunology, and co-mentor, Dr. Dario Vignali, is an NIH R01-funded tumor immunologist
with decades of experience in murine research. Also, an advisory committee of accomplished investigators
with expertise in tumor immunology, IL-6, LAG3, PD-1, and NSCLC will monitor Dr. Somasundaram’s progress
with quarterly meetings ensuring the completion of Dr. Somasundaram’s short-term goal of scientific
independence and long-term goal of becoming a tenure-track physician-scientist with expertise in systemic
inflammation, tumor immunology, checkpoint blockade resistance, and NSCLC. The results from this proposal
will form the basis for an R01 studying the translational role of IL6 induced anti-PD-1 resistance in NSCLC."
10932904,"Overdose has risen sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting an urgent need to understand the
impact of disasters on overdose. We need research to identify the types of policy measures that can prevent a
similar increase in overdose in future disasters. We also need to understand why certain communities are
particularly vulnerable to experiencing rises in overdose during and after a disaster, so that we can optimally
target prevention and disaster response efforts. We propose to use Big Events Theory as a framework to: 1)
study the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on overdose and related outcomes; 2) identify policy responses
to COVID-19 that affected individual-level overdose risk; and 3) examine how the pandemic's impact on
overdose risk varied across communities and populations. We hypothesize that COVID-19 containment
policies (e.g., workplace closings) contributed to social isolation, increasing the risk of consuming drugs alone
and limiting access to treatment and harm reduction services, thus increasing overdose risk. In contrast, public
health (e.g., take-home methadone waivers) and economic support policy responses to COVID-19 (e.g.,
housing eviction moratoria) may have eased access to health services for people who use drugs (PWUD) and
alleviated economic difficulties arising from the pandemic, blocking health and economic pathways through
which the pandemic could increase overdose risk. We hypothesize that communities with more structural
sources of despair (e.g., high rates of unemployment, poverty), and those that concurrently experienced other
major societal crises (natural disasters, political conflict, mass shootings) were more vulnerable to the effects
of COVID-19 on overdose. In contrast, social and economic policies enacted before the pandemic to protect
vulnerable populations (e.g., higher state Medicaid income threshold) may have reduced the impact of the
pandemic on overdose risk. Our Aims are to: (1) Determine how individual overdose risk in localities
(overall and by race/ethnicity) changed over 2019–2025 after county-level elevations in COVID-19 health
burden (hospitalizations, deaths). (2) Determine which county- and state-level policies targeting COVID-19
infection containment, public health of PWUDs, and economic support during the pandemic mediated
relations between changes in county-level COVID-19 burden and changes in overdose incidence, overall and
by race/ethnicity. (3) Identify which community conditions affected the strength of the relationships
between changes in county-level COVID-19 burden and individual overdose risk, overall and by race/ethnicity,
including: a) pre-existing community structural characteristics (e.g., poverty rate); b) pre-existing policies to
protect vulnerable populations (e.g., state Medicaid program income threshold); and c) intersecting crises. We
will build a multi-center cohort of ~2.4 million patients aged 18+ in six PCORnet® networks across the country
to track the impact of community COVID-19 burden on individual overdose risk. Our study findings will inform
the response to the current overdose crisis and to future disasters."
10912790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) depends on the prompt delivery of bystander
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (B-CPR), which is often administered by layperson community members until the
arrival of emergency medical services personnel. There is wide variability in both B-CPR participation rates and
survival of OHCA throughout the United States, particularly in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status. Our
central hypothesis is that unique modifiable barriers to B-CPR participation exist in high-risk neighborhoods in
Birmingham, Alabama, which can be used to inform a targeted community B-CPR intervention to increase B-
CPR rates and ultimately improve OHCA survival. We will test our hypothesis through the following specific aims:
In Aim 1 we will utilize geospatial mapping of local cardiac arrest and census tract data to identify and
characterize high-risk OHCA neighborhoods in Birmingham, AL. For our study, high-risk neighborhoods are
defined as those with a high incidence of OHCA and low B-CPR participation rates. In Aim 2 we will utilize
qualitative methods to understand barriers to B-CPR participation in high-risk neighborhoods and elicit
community feedback on the current American Heart Association CPR Anytimeâ training kit. Focus group
interviews with members of the Bystander Support Network will provide critical insights into the real-life bystander
experience, which will help inform local focus group discussions. Stakeholder interviews and focus group
discussions with community members residing in a high-risk Birmingham neighborhood will identify
neighborhood-specific barriers to B-CPR participation and provide feedback regarding the usability of the CPR
Anytimeâ training kit. Finally, in Aim 3 we will adapt the CPR Anytimeâ training kit using the feedback received
from community focus groups; and then pilot a prototype targeted community intervention specifically designed
to overcome modifiable barriers to B-CPR with the goal of increasing layperson OHCA awareness, CPR
education, and willingness to perform B-CPR in at-risk neighborhoods. This project is complemented by a
structured career development plan that has been designed with the input of an expert multidisciplinary
mentorship team that is committed to provide guidance throughout this award. During the 5 years of this award,
Dr. Ryan Coute, an early investigator committed to reducing OHCA treatment and outcome disparities, will learn
geospatial mapping, multimethod qualitative research, community intervention design, and implementation
science. This K23 award will ultimately support Dr. Coute’s transition to lead an independent research portfolio
and will provide the training and preliminary data needed for future R-level proposals; such as (1) evaluating the
impact of a targeted community-level B-CPR intervention on OHCA survival, (2) a multi-site trial to determine
the impact of the intervention on other communities, or (3) exploring the dynamics of neighborhood make-up and
social determinants of health on cardiac arrest survivorship for residents of at-risk communities."
10930108,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that has emerged as the most prevalent
form of late-life dementia in humans, in which the formation and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein
and amyloid-β (Aβ) are believed to play key roles in AD pathogenesis. Of note, the recent multiscale causal
network analysis in Accelerated Medicines Partnership for Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD) cohort identified that
VGF is the only downregulated key driver for AD. VGF is synthesized by neurons in the brain where it promotes
growth and survival of neurons, and is involved in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and energy homeostasis. VGF
plays a critical role in learning, memory, and pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this
proposal aims to develop a novel effective gene therapy for AD by targeting VGF. The major challenge in
the field of gene therapy for AD is to design a safe vector that can cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and target
the desired cells. We propose to develop innovative and targeted nanoparticles conjugated with human VGF
cDNA plasmid (pVGF) for the treatment of AD by delivering into brain after intravenous and intranasal
administration. Intranasal route provides a direct entrance of CNS therapeutics to the brain and therefore this is
a promising non-invasive pathway for gene to reach the brain parenchyma by bypassing the BBB. We would
synthesize two types of nanoparticles- liposomal nanoparticles and ω-3 fatty acid grafted chitosan based
nanomicelles. Both types of nanoparticles will be grafted with targeting ligands [transferrin (Tf), mannose (MAN),
and brain and neuron specific cell penetrating peptide (CPP)]. It has been found that the Tf and GLUT-1 receptors
are present on the surface of brain endothelial cells as well as on neurons. MAN is a substrate for GLUT1. In
addition, the CPP will further improve the penetration of nanoparticles/nanomicelles into brain. Therefore, we
propose to design liposomal nanoparticles encapsulating gene and modifying the surface of nanoparticles with
Tf, MAN and CPP. Similarly, ω-3 fatty acid grafted chitosan will be also modified by grafting with Tf, MAN and
CPP. These graft polymers will form self-assembled cationic nanomicelles in aqueous environment to provide
selective targeting of complexed pVGF to brain. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to design a
non-viral gene delivery carrier for efficient delivery of pVGF to brain through intravenous and intranasal
administrations for prevention and treatment of aging-related cognitive decile including AD. We propose three
specific aims to accomplish the long-term goal of the proposed research. Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize
nanoparticles/nanomicelles loaded with pVGF: The CPP-liposomal nanoparticles will be synthesized using
thin film hydration technique followed by insertion of Tf- and MAN- coupled micelles using post-insertion
technique. We propose to use three BBB and neuron specific CPPs: (i) a non-toxic fragment of tetanus toxin
known as tetanus toxin C fragment (TTC), (ii) penetratin, and (iii) rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG-9R containing
a nerve binding region). For nanomicelles, we will synthesize graft polymer (GP) of chitosan with ω-3 fatty acid.
The GP will be further grafted with MAN, Tf and CPP, and characterize by infrared (IR) and NMR spectroscopy.
The GP will self-assemble in aqueous media to form nanomicelles. The nanoparticles/nanomicelles will be
evaluated for particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, cell uptake and uptake mechanism(s),
transfection efficiency, cell cytotoxicity, and hemolysis assay. The transport efficacy of pVGF loaded
nanoparticles/nanomicelles will be evaluated across an in vitro BBB model designed by combining primary
human epithelial cells (HBMECs) and primary human astrocytes (HA). We will evaluate the effect of
nanoparticles/nanomicelles on transfection efficiency, Aβ levels and tau-phosphorylation in the cell culture BBB
model by seeding the APP Swe/Ind or MAPT P301L-overexpressing SHSY5Y cells in 24-well plates. Secretion
of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the culture supernatant, as well as intracellular accumulation in cell lysates, will be
determined by ELISA. Total tau and phosphorylated tau levels in the cell lysates and culture medium will be
measured by Western blot assay/ELISA. Aim 2. Evaluate the in vivo biocompatibility, organ toxicity,
pharmacokinetics and VGF expression in wild type mice of varying ages: To establish successful gene
therapies for AD, we will validate the nanoparticles/nanomicelles for their biocompatibility, organ toxicity, and
pharmacokinetics (biodistribution) after administering intravenously or intranasally into wild type mice at 3
months of age. In addition, the VGF gene delivery will be further validated in wild-type mice at 3 and 24 months
of ages. Aim 3. Assess the therapeutic effects of the nanoparticle/nanomicelle-mediated VGF gene
delivery on cognitive impairment and Aβ pathology: To establish successful gene therapies for AD-related
phenotypes and age-related cognitive decline, we will examine effects of VGF gene therapy through the
functionalized-nanoparticles/nanomicelles on neurobehaviors, synaptic functions and/or amyloid pathology. The
nanoparticles will be administered intravenously or intranasally into amyloid model 5xFAD mice and aged wild-
type mice, and the effects will be assessed. For human relevance, we will also use iPSC-derived neurons and
cerebral organoids from AD patients and assess the effects on neurodegeneration and Aβ/tau pathologies.
Collectively, we anticipate that the proposed study will contribute towards the development of high efficiency
non-viral gene delivery system to deliver pVGF into brain for successful gene therapy for AD and other
neurodegenerative diseases."

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), consisting of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE),
affects approximately 1 in 200 hospitalized patients <21 years old, and annual health care costs of pediatric VTE
can be estimated at $72M in the U.S. alone. As in adults, PE can be fatal in pediatric patients, and DVT can
result in long-term chronic venous insufficiency (the post-thrombotic syndrome [PTS]). However, treatment and
prevention of VTE with anticoagulant medications carries a risk for bleeding, which can be life-threating. In order
to optimize net clinical benefit, pediatric subpopulation-specific risks assessment models (RAMs) must be
developed and validated, and prognostic factors identified, in patients <21 years old. This has been the focus of
my career-long research work and mentorship. Recently, my multinational collaborators and I have made
significant advances in pediatric VTE treatment via publication in JAMA of practice-changing findings from the
U01-funded Kids-DOTT randomized trial on duration of anticoagulation for acute VTE in patients < 21 years old,
and have also generated published evidence on several subpopulation-specific RAMs over the past 3 years.
Yet, critical knowledge gaps remain regarding RAM development in critically ill patients and the investigation of
prognostic markers for clinically-important VTE outcomes, including recurrent VTE and PTS. In this K24
proposal, I will mentor six junior faculty clinical/translational researchers focused in VTE prevention and
treatment, from across four pediatric disciplines (hematology, critical care medicine, hospital medicine,
pharmacy) and three academic institutions (Johns Hopkins University [JHU], University of Alabama at
Birmingham, Harvard University), including three females and three individuals of color or historically
underrepresented backgrounds. The proposed studies build upon existing collaborations in data science and
biomarker-informed prognostic modeling, and will leverage data and/or biospecimens from multicenter studies
in which I play a leadership or senior collaborating role. In each project, the junior faculty mentee will also have
direct interaction with new or existing patients on study, for de novo data collection. Under this K24 proposal, I
will enhance my mentorship expertise via the JHU Master Mentor Program and grow my knowledge in both
Bayesian methods and plasma proteomics through online coursework and regular interactions with experts in
these fields, who also serve as co-investigators in the proposed projects. By facilitating the expansion of my
interdisciplinary research in pediatric VTE and strengthening my abilities to successfully mentor future junior
faculty clinical and translational researchers in the field of pediatric VTE from across a range of disciplines and
institutions, the proposed K24 will have significant impact as a force-multiplier in the pediatric VTE field."
10908614,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tobacco and alcohol are the most commonly used substances of abuse, resulting in heavy personal and public
health costs. The ability to identify risk prior to substance initiation has important potential to inform prevention
efforts and tailor more effective treatments through precision medicine approaches. Continuing technological
progress and reduced costs of genotyping have resulted in very large sample sizes in genetic association
studies, findings of which have allowed for the prediction of individual genetic risk, through polygenic risk scores.
These results have ignited interest in the use of polygenic scores to inform personalized prevention efforts,
population-level screening, and as statistical controls or genetic instruments within research. The incorporation
of polygenic scores in clinical and research settings shows promise, however there are several limitations to their
current use including modest predictive accuracy and limited portability across populations. The proposed
research will leverage a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of tobacco and alcohol use in 3.4 million
individuals, combined with ~2.5 million additional participants with microarray, exome, or whole-genome
sequencing data to improve polygenic prediction of substance use behaviors and to maximize predictive
accuracy of such scores across individuals of diverse genetic ancestries. There are two major research aims: 1)
to pool large cohorts of diverse ancestry genetic studies that include information on common and rare genetic
variation, and gene expression, to improve genomic risk prediction for substance use, and 2) evaluate and
correct for the sources of reduced cross-ancestry portability of polygenic scores in order to increase their utility
with higher predictive accuracy across all genetic ancestries. To accomplish these research aims and to achieve
the goal of an independent research career, this proposal includes new mentored training in 1) advanced and
functional genomics, 2) advanced statistic and population genetics, 3) ethical, legal, and social implications
(ELSI) of genetic research. This proposal directly aligns with NIDA’s goals to identify the genetic mechanisms
that influence substance use and to use this research to address health disparities. The candidate will receive
extensive mentorship and guidance with a team of leading experts in the fields of addiction, genetics, and
bioethics. The training and support provided by this award will facilitate the candidate’s long-term career goal as
an independent research scientist, building on her background in quantitative psychology, drug addiction, and
behavioral genetics. The proposed research, coupled with the candidate’s research potential, has the ability to
greatly expand the personal, clinical, and research utility of genomic prediction and to refine our understanding
of the genetic architecture of substance use."
10886807,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal will address the mechanisms underlying neuromuscular degeneration in Charcot-Marie-Tooth
disease (CMT). CMT is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder with causative
mutations found in over 100 genes. While considered a rare disease, CMT is the most common inherited disorder
of the peripheral nervous system, affecting ~1 in 3,500 people worldwide. Dominant mutations in 6 different tRNA
synthetases (aaRSs) cause forms of CMT (aaRS-CMT), making them the largest family of CMT-associated
genes. Each of these genes is involved in protein synthesis suggesting a common mechanism that leads to
defects in protein production and ultimately CMT pathologies.
Our recently published work uncovered a potential mechanism underlying aaRS-CMT. We found that mutant
aaRSs inappropriately sequester tRNAs from the ribosome, which stalls ribosome function and activates an
integrated stress response (ISR) via a sensor protein, GCN2. ISR activation causes two major cellular events:
1) shutdown of a major form of protein synthesis and, 2) upregulation of the transcription factor, ATF4, and its
target genes. The relative contributions of each of these events is currently unknown.
One goal of this project is to determine the role of ATF4 and target genes in the pathophysiology observed in
aaRS-CMT. Preliminary results show that ATF4 overexpression is toxic to motor neurons and produces a CMT-
like phenotype in mice, evidence that ATF4 could be a viable therapeutic target for aaRS-CMT. In Aim 1 we will
manipulate ATF4 expression levels in validated mouse models of aaRS-CMT to determine whether the disease
pathology is driven by decreased protein translation or by increased expression of the ATF4 gene.
To advance toward therapeutic applications we need to establish that human motor neurons also activate the
ISR in response to aaRS-CMT mutations. Therefore, in Aim 2 we will establish and validate human induced
pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neuron cultures which have been genetically engineered to model
aaRS-CMT. We will also test therapeutic strategies in these human cell-based models. Interestingly, ATF4
expression is common in many different types of neurodegeneration. Therefore, in Aim 3, we will integrate data
from ATF4 mice in Aim 1, and hiPSC-derived motor neurons in Aim 2 to identify common genes and cellular
pathways involved in ATF4-mediated neurodegeneration. These hiPSC-based models will be a powerful tool to
help identify and develop new targets or pathways for potential therapeutic interventions.
This MOSAIC (Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers) Postdoctoral Career
Transition Award to Promote Diversity will be supported by excellent career development resources and a
mentoring team of globally recognized experts in CMT (R.W. Burgess) and human stem cells (M.F. Pera) at The
Jackson Laboratory for Mammalian Genetics."
10914270,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) resulting from underlying chronic lung disease (Group 3, CLD-PH) is a common
disorder associated with significant symptoms and risk of death. Traditional concepts of CLD-PH pathogenesis
focus on mechanisms of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction yet vasodilating therapies have failed to provide
benefit for CLD-PH patients. Current evidence indicates that pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic changes in
pulmonary vascular cells lead to CLD-PH through progressive pulmonary vascular remodeling. Altered
mitochondrial energy metabolism plays a key role in this pulmonary vascular remodeling and is a potential but
unexploited treatment target. This proposal outlines research and training that will enable the PI to build on his
experience in clinical PH care and epidemiology. The PI’s long-term goal is to become an independent
collaborative leader in patient-oriented clinical and translational research focused on developing and evaluating
novel treatment approaches for CLD-PH. To achieve this goal, the PI will require further training in: 1) practical
and theoretical aspects of cellular metabolic phenotyping and application to human samples; and 2) conduct of
prospective clinical trials to assess mechanistically-targeted interventions in patients with PH. Abundant
preclinical evidence demonstrates that reductions in the expression and function of the major metabolic
regulator, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), play a critical role in mitochondrial and
metabolic derangements in pulmonary vascular cells. Evolving evidence demonstrates that abnormal
mitochondrial metabolism extends beyond pulmonary vascular tissues and is observed in right ventricle
cardiomyocytes, skeletal muscle, and circulating platelets, suggesting more global metabolic perturbations in
PH. Further, activation of PPARγ with clinically available, antidiabetic, thiazolidinedione (TZD) medications can
prevent or reverse experimental PH. The overarching hypothesis for this project is that mitochondrial
bioenergetic derangements in CLD-PH are reflected in circulating platelets and can be improved with TZD
therapy. Aim 1 will examine platelet glycolytic and mitochondrial bioenergetic function in a cross-sectional
study recruiting subjects with CLD-PH, CLD without PH, and healthy controls. The proposed studies will
provide the first definition of bioenergetic function in freshly isolated CLD-PH platelets and test for ex vivo
treatment with pioglitazone (a TZD). Aim 2 will involve a phase 2 randomized cross-over trial to assess the
metabolic impact of pioglitazone in CLD-PH patients. The influence of pioglitazone versus placebo on
mitochondrial energy production will be assessed (primary mechanistic outcome) as well as safety and disease
efficacy (secondary outcomes). The proposal leverages an outstanding training plan and environment with the
support of an experienced multi-dimensional mentorship team to address a critical clinical need in the field of
pulmonary vascular biology. Completion of the proposed training and studies will position the PI to compete
successfully for independent funding and exert durable impact on the clinical management of PH."

Bioenergetic dysfunction is likely an early, critical component of neuropathogenesis of the second-most common
neurodegenerative dementia, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). However, it has been difficult to elucidate the specific
patterns and mechanisms of bioenergetic dysfunction, such as mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction, glycolytic failure, or
failure of energy reserves in vivo in the neuropathogenesis of this disease. Elucidating the different mechanistic pathways
of metabolic dysfunction involved in DLB pathogenesis, and determining the temporal sequence and pattern of these
events, will be critical to developing targeted therapies. Capitalizing on our combined expertise and our advancements in
neuroimaging methodologies, we have the capacity to combine a new PET radioligand that quantifies brain mitochondrial
Complex I, with both fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET to assess glycolytic energy metabolism, and ultra-high field strength
7T 31P-MRS for assessment of ATP and other high-energy phosphate bioenergetic metabolites. Utilizing this multimodal
neuroimaging, along with extensive clinical characterization, we will determine mitochondrial respiratory and glycolytic
contribution to ATP dysregulation across the clinical spectrum via evaluation of control, at-risk, prodromal, and clinically
established DLB. We will address the following aims: 1) characterize specific mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction
in the brain as DLB pathogenesis progresses from at-risk to established disease; 2) dissect specific bioenergetic pathways
contributing to ATP dysregulation in DLB; 3) analyze the relationship between brain mitochondrial and bioenergetic
dysfunction and changes in cognitive function and peripheral measurements of bioenergetics; and 4) explore differences
in bioenergetic pathway dysfunction between DLB and Alzheimer’s disease."
10741812,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The potential of checkpoint immunotherapy to combat cancer has been established in several cancer
types. However, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), checkpoint immunotherapy has not led to
clinical benefit. Although multiple factors likely contribute, one significant factor is the extensive infiltration of
PDAC by multiple lineages of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Therefore, one promising therapeutic strategy
is the targeting these myeloid cells to improve T cell-mediated immunity. These realizations have led to a
significant number of clinical trials combining myeloid targeted agent with checkpoint immunotherapy.
However, all current therapeutic strategies are subject to compensatory actions by untargeted subsets of
monocytes, granulocytes, and/or tissue resident macrophages, which may ultimately limit therapeutic efficacy.
To overcome this limitation, our team has developed a small molecule allosteric agonist of CD11b, ADH-503.
Our data will clearly demonstrate: 1) CD11b-agonism both rapidly repolarizes TAMs to support anti-tumor
immunity while simultaneously blunting the recruitment of multiple lineages of suppressive myeloid cells
without the compensatory mechanisms seen with other myeloid-targeting agents. 2) CD11b-agonist-induce
myeloid reprograming reawakens T cell immunity that in-turn significantly limit disease progression. 3) The
combination of CD11b-agonist with checkpoint immunotherapy leads to dramatic tumor regression and long-
term survival in PDAC models that are otherwise completely resistant to PD-1 therapy. These stunning data
drive our hypothesis that CD11b agonism reprograms the TME to overcome resistance to checkpoint
immunotherapy. To test this, we will:
Aim 1: Determine the molecular mechanisms by which CD11b-agonism directly impacts myeloid cells.
Aim 2: Determine the cellular mechanism(s) by which CD11b-agonism enhances T cell immunity.
Aim 3: Determine if chemotherapy or radiation therapy better maximize the anti-tumor immunity and
the efficacy generated by ADH-503 plus checkpoint immunotherapy.
Impact: These studies investigate a new approach in current clinical development that can render PDACs
responsive to immunotherapy."

Despite recent advances in treatment, the overall mortality for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) remains high and current treatment regimens incur significant long-term morbidity. Targeting the
immune checkpoint PD-1 with pembrolizumab and nivolumab has revolutionized HNSCC treatment. However,
the overall response rate of these immunotherapies remains low, around 15-20%. This highlights the urgent
need to identify novel therapeutic options for HNSCC to improve mortality, reduce morbidity, and enhance the
activity and response rate of immune oncology (IO) approaches for HNSCC. We hypothesize that targeting
HNSCC oncogenic signaling networks and disabling their immune evasive mechanisms may increase the
response to anti-PD-1 treatment as part of a novel rational therapeutic strategy. In this regard, our laboratory
contributed to the discovery that the persistent activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling circuitry is the most
frequent dysregulated signaling mechanism in HNSCC, and that mTOR inhibition exerts potent antitumor activity
in multiple experimental HNSCC model systems and in a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT01195922). Remarkably,
~20% of HNSCC lesions harbor driver PIK3CA mutations encoding active PI3Kα subunits, and yet ~90% of
HNSCC lesions exhibit aberrant PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. In search for the underlying mechanisms, we
conducted a kinome wide RNAi screen, which revealed that persistent HER3 tyrosine phosphorylation and
association with PI3Kα sustain pathway activation in most of the HNSCC lesions. Indeed, HER3 is highly
expressed and persistently activated in most HNSCC lesions, correlating with poor prognosis. The best-in-class
anti-HER3 monoclonal antibody CDX-3379 inhibits the ligand-dependent and -independent activation of human
and murine HER3 by locking HER3 in its auto-inhibited configuration, and has demonstrated pharmacodynamic
and clinical activity in HNSCC patients. CDX-3379 exhibits potent antitumor activity in PIK3CA wild type HNSCC
tumor xenografts and patient derived xenografts (PDXs). Furthermore, we have obtained strong preliminary
results supporting that CDX-3379 administration 1) abolishes PI3K-mTOR signaling, 2) reverses the immune
evasive HNSCC microenvironment, and 3) can result in complete remission when combined with anti-PD-1
therapies in recently developed syngeneic mouse HNSCC models. Our premise is that co-targeting the HER3
signaling circuitry combined with anti-PD-1 blockade may represent a novel multimodal precision therapeutic
approach for HNSCC aimed at achieving durable responses and cancer remission. We will now aim 1) to
elucidate the contribution of genomic alterations in the PI3K-mTOR signaling network to anti-HER3 sensitivity
and resistance, and 2) to establish the impact of targeting and co-targeting the HER3-PI3K/mTOR signaling
network on the tumor immune microenvironment and response to PD-1 blockade, aiming at achieving a single
cell level understanding of the anti-cancer immune response. These studies will inform the molecular
stratification for patient selection in future multimodal precision immune oncology trials."

10886772,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cognitive dysfunction and dementia rates are increasing worldwide in part due to the significant increase
in life expectancy. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the main cause of dementia, is a progressive
neurodegenerative brain disease characterized by impairments in cognitive function. Aging is the main risk
factor for AD and unfortunately there is no effective treatment for slowing down aging or treating AD.
Current approaches to treat AD (e.g., amyloid beta accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation) have been
unsuccessful which calls for novel approaches to treat the full spectrum of this disease. Recent studies
have postulated that cognitive decline and AD might be manifestations of metabolic disorders. In particular,
changes in glucose metabolism and brain insulin sensitivity have been identified as common features
observed in AD. Our published works reveal that the endocrine hormone fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) decreases body weight during obesity, improves insulin sensitivity, and corrects metabolic
dysfunctions in animal models. Clinical trials with FGF21 mimetics have also demonstrated the efficacy of
targeting this pathway to improve metabolic profiles in humans. Interestingly, recent data suggests that
FGF21 administration may also prevent neurodegeneration and pathological deficits in animal models of
AD. While circulating FGF21 levels are derived primarily by the liver, our recently published study reveals
the unexpected discovery that FGF21 is also expressed in a very specific region of the central nervous
system. Specifically, FGF21 is expressed in the retrosplenial cortex and can signal to the hippocampus
and can regulate learning and memory. A previous study demonstrates that FGF21 is induced from
neurons in response to mitochondrial stress. These observations are the backbone of our main hypothesis
in this proposal which seeks to interrogate whether FGF21 signals to neurons in hippocampus to not only
improve neuronal metabolism and memory, but also improves AD symptoms. This proposal employs
various genetic AD mouse models to explore different aspects of AD, as well as genetic and
pharmacological approaches, to investigate the effects of FGF21 and in the improvement of memory and
cognition. Together, these studies will not only further our knowledge of the role of FGF21 in neuronal
metabolism but will also provide a better understanding of potential metabolic abnormalities during AD.
Finally, these studies may reveal a potential therapeutic approach to treat AD and its related dementias."
10894758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT:
Vitiligo is an autoimmune skin disease characterized by the progressive destruction of melanocytes by
autoreactive CD8+ T cells, resulting in disfiguring patches of white depigmented skin that cause significant
psychological distress among patients. The gold standard treatment involves narrow band ultraviolet B
(NBUVB) therapy, which induces the migration of hair follicle melanocyte precursors, in conjunction with topical
steroids to suppress the local immune. Unfortunately, treatment is time consuming and re-pigmentation is often
uneven. It is unknown why some depigmented areas persist and others re-pigment within the same lesion. Our
recent work using non-invasive multiphoton microscopy (MPM) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
has demonstrated that a subpopulation of keratinocytes enriched in vitiligo skin is important in disease
persistence. We termed these cells ‘stress keratinocytes’ as they upregulate molecules associated with
inflammation, wounding and other injuries. In this K08 application, we propose to study how local signals from
keratinocytes interact with T cells and melanocytes to drive vitiligo persistence and repigmentation after
treatment. Using MPM imaging, scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, we will define if stress keratinocytes
signals to T cells and paucity of melanocyte recruiting factors are enriched in treatment resistant areas
(specific aim 1). We will also compare test to see whether adding these factors locally is sufficient to promote
repigmentation (specific aim 2). Completion of this work will define how local tissue factors shape immune
responses and melanocyte homeostasis in the skin has implications beyond vitiligo.
This K08 application is designed to provide Dr. Jessica Shiu, MD PhD, the scientific training and professional
development necessary to become an independent R01-funded investigator in the field of cutaneous biology.
She will be mentored by Dr. Anand Ganesan, a physician scientist and a pigment cell biology expert with
expertise on single cell genomics and skin imaging. Her secondary mentors, Drs. Bogi Andersen and Qing Nie,
have extensive experience in keratinocyte biology and single-cell RNA sequencing analyses. Additional
scientists, Drs. Mihaela Balu and Tinoco will provide further expertise in noninvasive imaging and cutaneous
immunity. The work takes place within the outstanding scientific environment at UCI in the Department of
Dermatology and Skin Biology Resource Center and has the support of multiple state-of-the-art centers
including the NSF-Simons Center for Multiscale Cell Fate Research and Genomics High Throughput Facility.
This training plan will help her develop technical skills on noninvasive imaging and spatial transcriptomics as
well as quantitative methods needed for the analysis of dynamic populations of keratinocytes so that she will
be positioned as a leading physician scientist in the field of cutaneous biology."

In response to NOT-21-039 and related PAR-22-093, we propose this project to address several urgent needs
in the field. Mouse models spanning different ages and sexes are routinely used to quantify anatomic, molecular,
and pathologic changes in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Yet, the only available
standard mouse brain atlases are constructed from 2-month-old adult male mice. Furthermore, although both
normal aging and AD neurodegeneration display sexually dimorphic features, the scientific community lacks the
sexually differentiated rodent brain atlases necessary to study these attributes. By applying cutting edge
technologies, we have developed for BRAIN Initiative connectomic and cell type mapping projects, we will (1)
generate sexually dimorphic 3D aging and AD brain atlases with granular hippocampus (HPF) molecular
domains, that can be used as standard atlas templates for all HPF work and (2) we will comprehensively
characterize morphological dystrophies, as well as connectional and synaptic disruptions, in aging and AD. In
Specific Aim 1, publicly available standard 3D HPF atlases of aging and AD brains will be created. Data will be
generated in 2-, 9-, and 18-month-old wildtype (WT), 5xFAD (early AD onset), and MAPT(H1)*N279K (late AD
onset) male and female mice. Fine HPF domain delineations will be facilitated by 3D volumetric images of cyto-
and myeloarchitecture, while additional histopathological markers (Aβ plaques/tau tangles) and
chemoarchitectural details (glutamate, GABA, PV, SST, Calb1) will be mapped to create comprehensive
histopathological and chemoarchitectural HPF atlases. In Specific Aim 2, We will systematically apply a genetic
MORF3 sparse labeling approach to label, reconstruct, and analyze cell type specific neuronal morphology of all
HPF regions at the granular level of their domains in WT, Vglut1.MORF3/5xFAD, PV.MORF3/5xFAD,
Vglut1.MORF3/MAPT(H1)*N279K, and PV.MORF3/MAPT(H1)*N279K mice across age and sex. Our whole
brain 3D clearing, immunostaining, imaging, and 3D neuronal reconstruction pipeline will be applied. Given that
an etiology of AD-related cognitive decline is selective HPF synaptic disruptions, with dorsal HPF nodes being
some of the earliest affected in AD, in Specific Aim 3, will examine progressive connectional disruptions along
amyloid and tau pathology progression. Male and female MORF3 and double transgenic mice, MORF3/5xFAD
and MORF3/MAPT(H1)*N279K, at 2m, 9m, and 18m of age will be used to reveal potential connectivity changes
across aging and AD. The same groups will be used to determine synaptic-level HPF disruptions with the
application of Expansion Microscopy that will capture super-resolution images of synaptic connections. In
Specific Aim 4, we will create a web-based data portal that enables visualization, comparison, and analysis of
neural circuits and cell types in 3D aging and AD brains. Our team, with decades of experience in connectomics,
brain atlasing, and online visualization, is sure to deliver standard HPF atlas templates for all neuroscience
research and to determine sexually dimorphic anatomic regions vulnerable across age and AD progression."
10742942,"Project Summary
The cytokine IL-27 is a critical mechanism for restraining immune hyperactivity during infection. During
Toxoplasma gondii infection, the loss of IL-27 results in a lethal, CD4+ T cell mediated immune response as
well as elevated inflammatory cytokine responses and systemic thrombosis. How these mechanisms mediate
pathology, and possibly intersect with one another, is unclear. GM-CSF production by CD4+ T cells is
enhanced in IL-27 deficient mice, and we have recently observed that blockade of this cytokine leads to
survival of infected IL-27-/- mice. GM-CSF can enhance monocyte and macrophage responses as well as
contribute to immunothrombosis, suggesting that this may be a potential central mechanism by which IL-27
mediated protection is achieved. Additionally, we have observed that the loss of IL-27 results in enhanced
monopoiesis and monocyte responses to infection. Monocytes do not express the IL-27 receptor, but long-term
hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) do and can be skewed towards several differentiation pathways by IL-27.
Thus, we hypothesize that the loss of IL-27 leads to enhanced monocyte development during infection which
may in turn be impacted by GM-CSF during later stages of infection to mediate pathology. To test this, we will
analyze if HSC development and monocyte phenotypes are impacted by IL-27 during the early stages of
toxoplasmosis and if enhanced monocytes responses are pathological in this setting. This will be achieved
through a combination of cell transfers, high-dimensional flow cytometry, and scRNA-seq as well as selective
depletion experiments. We will then determine the mechanisms by which GM-CSF mediates pathology in the
absence of IL-27. This will be done by blocking GM-CSF during infection of IL-27-/- mice and analyzing the
immune parameters connected to pathology. Following this, the GM-CSF receptor will be selectively removed
from potential cell types to determine if this rescues IL-27 deficient mice during infection. Together, these
studies will enhance our understanding of cytokine driven pathologies and mechanisms of immune protection."

Despite its historical importance as a plague on humankind, syphilis remains among the most poorly
understood of all human infections. This is a direct result of severe research constraints imposed by the
historic inability to cultivate Treponema pallidum (Tp) continuously in vitro. In a departure from more
conventional approaches, about 15 years ago we embarked on a bold structural biology-based initiative to
characterize Tp’s lipoproteins (LPs), molecules critical to the membrane biology, bioenergetics, and
intermediary metabolism of Tp, as a means of unlocking the mechanistic evolutionary “secrets” of Tp
infection and syphilis pathogenesis. This progressive research avenue has become a very successful
discovery platform, yielding many highly novel findings, including establishing a number of new bacterial
molecular paradigms. For example, we discovered a novel bi-functional FAD pyrophosphatase/FMN
transferase in Tp; this, in turn, led us to identify a post-translational protein flavinylation pathway in Tp’s
periplasm, yielding flavoproteins that ostensibly influence cellular redox reactions. We then obtained
evidence for Tp encoding an atypical flavin-based Rhodobacter Nitrogen Fixation (RNF)-type redox pump,
likely representing the longstanding missing link between Tp’s membrane electrochemical gradient, redox
balance, ATP generation, and an acetogenic energy conservation pathway. Historically, Tp has been
thought not to encode such systems. Our contention of a flavin-based redox system not only addresses a
number of longstanding unexplained metabolic dilemmas for Tp, but it also engenders a paradigm shift by
now establishing Tp as a flavin auxotroph. We also have demonstrated that TP0572, a putative FMN-
dependent ferric reductase, is flavinylated by Ftp (TP0796), likely an essential prerequisite for Tp’s
reductive iron assimilation pathway(s). In addition, predicted cytosolic flavoproteins must play prominently
in protecting Tp from oxidative stress and in maintaining the balance of NAD+/NADH. These collective
notions support that, with limited potential for ATP generation in the absence of quinones, Tp has evolved
a “flavin-centric metabolic lifestyle” to fulfill its metabolic requirements for human infection. This project
shall address three core metabolic features relevant to Tp’s flavin biology: protein flavinylation and
flavoprotein biogenesis (Aim 1), reductive iron assimilation and Fe-S protein biogenesis (Aim 2), and redox

inhibitor(s) targeting Tp’s flavin auxotrophy as a potential new research tool(s) and/or new
antimicrobial(s) against Tp and other pathogenic spirochetes (Aim 4). Taken together, this project shall
elucidate key features concerning how Tp has evolved to exploit flavins as an underpinning of its stealth
pathogenicity, potentially leading to new strategies to thwart human infection."
10871836,"Project Summary
Our team has demonstrated availability of evidence-based supportive care services in community oncology to
support informal (unpaid/ family) caregivers in caring for themselves and their care recipient undergoing cancer
treatment (e.g., psychosocial support, self-care/ wellness classes, medical task training), but connection to
these services is abysmal. A scalable and systematic process is critically needed to identify caregiver needs
and connect caregivers with services. This may be especially valuable for lung cancer caregivers who report
exceptional supportive care needs and high levels of caregiver burden. We previously demonstrated strong
feasibility and acceptability of Caregiver Oncology Needs Evaluation Tool (CONNECT) in a pilot randomized
clinical trial with 40 lung cancer caregivers at one academic medical center. We also observed significant
improvements in caregiver burden and a clinically significant decrease in depression in the intervention group
relative to control group. We propose in this next step of multi-site intervention planning, to also include
navigation to address barriers that may hamper caregiver supportive care use. The overall goal of this program
of research is to develop innovative and scalable programs to improve supportive care delivery for cancer
caregivers in the community. In this application, we propose to gather essential data for a future multi-site
efficacy trial of CONNECT in collaboration with the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program
Research Base (WF NCORP RB) and key stakeholders. For Aim 1, we will survey NCORP sites to determine
outpatient oncology practice (N=60) interest and capacity to test the CONNECT Intervention across the broad
NCORP network. For Aim 2 and Aim 3, we will conduct a multi-site randomized pilot trial. For Aim 2, we will
assess the multi-site feasibility (accrual, participation, and retention) of the CONNECT Intervention enrolling
120 lung cancer caregiver-patient dyads (CONNECT, n=40; Standard Care, n=40; Generic Resource List,
n=40) with the goal of informing methods for the future trial. For Aim 3, we will obtain preliminary data on site
training needs, time needed for site participation, and communication processes between participating sites
and study personnel to optimize multi-site intervention delivery in the future fully powered trial. Pending
demonstration of feasibility, we will conduct a future fully powered efficacy trial using the NCORP network."
10867390,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will investigate a novel small-molecule strategy as a means to activate necroptosis, overcome the
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and rekindle immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
responsiveness of human solid tumors. Our recent work with influenza virus (IAV) has outlined a new pathway
of nuclear necroptosis. Nuclear necroptosis during IAV infections is initiated when the host sensor protein ZBP1
detects viral Z-RNA (left-handed dsRNA) and triggers RIPK3-dependent necroptosis from the nucleus, releasing
nuclear “danger signals” (DAMPs and alarmins), and driving a potent inflammatory response. But what is
deleterious in severe influenza may be beneficial for cancer immunotherapy, because triggering inflammatory
nuclear necroptosis in the TME is an attractive way to make a cold tumor hot. We have discovered a compound
(CBL0137) which activates ZBP1 and potently reverses ICB unresponsiveness in mouse models of melanoma.
CBL0137 activates ZBP1 by inducing Z-DNA formation in cells, bypassing need for active virus replication.
Here, we propose to test the combination of CBL0137+nivolumab/ipilimumab in a small feasibility trial in patients
with locally advanced and metastatic melanoma, a tumor type in which ICB has shown great promise, but where
unresponsiveness remains a significant problem. We hypothesize that that induction of necroptosis with
CBL0137 in combination with immunotherapy will not only invigorate the anti-melanoma immune response to
ICB, but will also overcome the resistance conferred by CAFs and MDSCs in the melanoma TME. We propose
two Aims to test this hypothesis:
Aim 1. Conduct a proof-of-concept clinical trial to examine the feasibility of CBL0137+ICB (nivolumab
and ipilimumab) in melanoma. This Aim will establish whether intravenous administration of CBL0137 is safe
and tolerated in the setting of the frontline immunotherapy by combining CBL0137+nivolumab/ipilimumab in
locally advanced and metastatic melanoma.
Aim 2. Elucidate the biological effects of neoadjuvant CBL0137+ICB in melanoma patients. We will
systematically analyze on-treatment biopsies: (1) to evaluate Z-DNA formation and necroptosis activation in the
melanoma TME; and (2) to characterize treatment-induced changes in both malignant and reactive cell types
(e.g., CAFs and MDSCs) in the melanoma TME, using in situ spatial transcriptomics and immunofluorescence
approaches, each coupled with cutting edge informatics. These studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic
insight into the effects of CBL0137 on the tumor stroma during ICB therapy.
A team of experts in clinical and translational oncology (Olszanski, Astsaturov), and necroptosis and immunity
(Balachandran) will lead the proposed studies. This concept will establish CBL0137 synergy with ICB and will
open an entirely new range of opportunities for using this necroptosis-activating ‘virus mimetic’ as a means to
make immunologically cold tumors hot."
10888407,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) has become a major public health
crisis. To date, therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease have been largely ineffective resulting in an
increased focus on identifying effective prevention strategies. Daily 24-hour activity behaviors (sleep, physical
activity, and sedentary time) may be modifiable risk factors for ADRD. A better understanding of these risk
factors may provide an opportunity for early prevention, particularly in the asymptomatic phase prior to the
development of ADRD-related pathology. The availability of longitudinal actigraphy data to objectively-measure
24-hour activity in a strongly ADRD-phenotyped cohort has created the ideal opportunity to investigate
potential pathways linking 24-hour activity behaviors with ADRD. The objective of this K01 is to longitudinally
investigate changes in 24-hour activity with changes in cognition, structural neuroimaging, and fluid biomarkers
of Alzheimer’s disease and concomitant pathological pathways prior to the onset of clinical dementia. I will
leverage data from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project (VMAP) cohort with repeated measures of
actigraphy, brain MRI, and fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology and concomitant injury. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is changes in 24-hour activity will be associated with cognitive decline,
structural neuroimaging changes, and Alzheimer’s disease and concomitant pathway changes, preceding
symptom onset. Based on this hypothesis, the proposal aims to 1) characterize associations between changes
in 24-hour activity and cognitive decline, 2) examine changes in 24-hour activity in relation to MRI markers of
neurodegeneration and small vessel disease, and 3) evaluate changes in 24-hour activity behaviors with fluid
biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology and concomitant pathways. Taken together, these aims will
combine objective measurement of 24-hour activity with cognitive, neuroimaging, and state of the art fluid
biomarker data to fill existing gaps in the research. Simultaneously, throughout the award, the candidate will
gain advanced training in 1) Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and epidemiology; 2) measurement and
modeling of structural imaging and fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer’s neuropathology and concomitant pathways
of injury; and 3) advanced statistical methods, positioning the candidate to become a leader in the fields of
aging and Alzheimer’s disease epidemiology. Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the Vanderbilt Memory
and Alzheimer’s Center provide the ideal environment to complete the proposed research and training
activities. The overall goal of this K01 is to inform a series of R01 awards and independent research program
focused on identifying and characterizing behavioral risk factors for ADRD. With the support of this K01 award
and expert mentorship, the candidate will achieve this goal and successfully transition to independent
investigator status by the conclusion of the training period."
10846778,"Summary/Abstract
Candidate: I am a neurologist-scientist at UCSF with a long-term goal to lead an independent laboratory-
based research program focused on T cell autoantigen targets in autoimmune neurologic diseases. The K08
application is key for my career development, providing me with (1) mentorship from an accomplished team of
scientists and physician-scientists, (2) dedicated teaching to expand my knowledge in basic and clinical
immunology and synthetic biology (3) extensive hands-on training in biosensor engineering and T cell Ag
detection, and (4) data collection for an R01 application.
Research: T cells are important contributors to autoimmune neurological disorders including MS, MOGAD,
and autoimmune encephalitis. Deeper understanding of pathogenesis is needed to develop more precise
therapeutics that promise both improved efficacy and better safety profiles relative to broad-based
immunosuppressant medications currently used. While high throughput methods for antibody discovery have
transformed the field of autoimmune neurology by producing crucial diagnostic biomarkers, T cell Ags remain
largely undefined given the lack of high throughput T cell Ag discovery platforms. This knowledge gap is
significant given that T cells play important roles in disease pathogenesis. The current proposal introduces a
novel technology to address the challenge of simultaneously evaluating many candidate Ags against a diverse
T cell repertoire, which is based on an engineered biosensor that detects immune synapse formation at the
single cell level, allowing multiplexed analysis. This proposal outlines the first experiments to further develop
immune synapse sensing technology for the purposes of Ag discovery in autoimmune T cells.
Mentorship and Training: My training will be accomplished through formal coursework and under direct
mentorship of world leaders including Wendell Lim, PhD, who has extensive expertise in synthetic biology and
cell engineering technologies. Professor Lim has over his 20 years at UCSF mentored ~50 postdoctoral fellows
as well as 5 clinical fellows. I will be co-mentored by Scott Zamvil, MD/PhD and Michael Wilson MD, MAS, both
physician-scientists with extensive experience in Neuroimmunology and autoimmune antigen biology.
Environment: The University of California, San Francisco is an exceptional research environment with state-
of-the-art facilities and world-renowned faculty. As a member of the UCSF Neurology Division of
Neuroimmunology and Glial Biology and the UCSF Cell Design Institute, my work and training will bridge
synthetic cell engineering and autoimmune Ag discovery. I will benefit from existing clinical autoantigen
discovery infrastructure including the UCSF Center for Encephalitis & Meningitis led by Dr Wilson."
10904957,"Project Summary/Abstract
The production of functional proteins is a multistep process whereby newly synthesized
polypeptides are enzymatically processed, folded, and assembled into oligomeric complexes. Key
maturation processes occur co-translationally by coupling mRNA translation and nascent protein
maturation on the ribosomes, assisted by a network of regulatory proteins. Despite decades of
basic research, our understanding of co-translational processes is shaped predominantly by
genetic manipulations in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell models, but limited data exists in cells
from intact mammalian physiological systems. To overcome this hurdle, this project aims to
develop a comprehensive understanding of co-translational regulation of nascent proteins as they
reach their functional state within the angiogenic signaling pathways of the endothelium in the
heart during aging. We have recently developed an approach and tested the potential for
simultaneous isolation of proteins present within the actively translating polyribosome/mRNA
complexes within the endothelium of the heart. State-of-the-art multiplex labelling and
quantification of these proteins has permitted the identification of concordant and discordant
regulated cell-specific pathways based on actively translating mRNA and protein profiles
associated with the endothelial stress. Leveraging this innovative advancement in “functional co-
translatomics”, we aim to study the changes in co-translational complexes within endothelial cell
angiogenic ligand-receptor and cell-cell interaction signaling networks within the aging heart. In
Aim 1
, we will define changes in the co-translational regulation of concordantly regulated
angiogenic signaling pathways during neonatal and adult life with aging and gender. In
Aim 2
, we
will define the post-translational modifications of proteins within discordantly regulated angiogenic
signaling pathways which may contribute to the impairment angiogenesis in the heart during
aging. Ultimately this knowledge could aid in the development of more effective means for
diagnosing and treating the impairment of angiogenesis that occurs with aging and predisposes
the heart to cardiovascular disease and injury."

Our application addresses a fundamental need of the scientific community focused on curing Multiple Sclerosis
(MS). MS is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that affects more than 2.5 million people
worldwide with an unknown etiology. Progress in the understanding of MS has been constrained by a lack of
understanding of the reciprocal interactions between behaviorally-relevant neuronal activity and changes in
myelination in health and disease. The link between behaviorally-relevant neuronal activity and circuit-specific
changes in myelination remain unknown, as does the role of behavior interventions in enhancing remyelination.
Recently, we have developed new approaches to visualize myelin, oligodendrocytes, and their precursors in
the intact mouse brain, allowing an unprecedented view into their dynamics and behavior in health and
disease. In this application, we propose to capitalize on the inter-individual, longitudinal, subcellular insights
revealed by these techniques to discern the effects of changes in local circuit activity and myelination on motor
behavior. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) evaluate how behaviorally-relevant neuronal circuit function
regulates myelination during learning and myelin repair and 2) to elucidate how changes in myelin specificity
modulate motor learning and behavior. This proposal represents a novel synthesis of approaches to study
neural circuit function during behavior and oligodendrocyte biology, and breaks new ground in the
understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor learning and dysfunction following demyelinating injuries."
10741827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 As a member of the class of neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), the serotonin transporter (SERT)
regulates levels of serotonin in the brain through reuptake or forward transport. Dysfunction of SERT has been
associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and autism in humans. As such, SERT is a major target for
therapeutic development as well as sites of action of drugs of abuse. Transport of serotonin from the synapse
into the presynaptic cell is energetically coupled to symport of sodium and chloride ions. However, in the
presence of amphetamine derivatives, this mechanism is altered. Molecules in the amphetamine class induce
reverse transport by NSSs, leading to increased synaptic levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.
This reverse transport mechanism is mediated by the N-terminus of the transporter, a hub for protein-protein
interactions and signaling, and is modulated by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a lipid enriched in
the plasma membrane of neurons. The central objective of this proposal is to examine the conformational
dynamics underlying transport for human SERT (hSERT), illuminating the role of its N-terminus in both
forward and reverse transport. Aim 1 will use double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy to
probe conformational equilibria of full-length hSERT under different conditions to benchmark structural
transitions across the transport cycle. Aim 2 will characterize the conformation of the N-terminus through
surveying the mobility and solvent accessibility of singly labeled sites and define its structural reorganization in
the presence of PIP2. The N-terminus and PIP2 are hypothesized to impose structural changes to the hSERT
transmembrane domain, which prompts reverse transport in the presence of amphetamine. The proposed
experiments are expected to reveal insights into the transport mechanism of eukaryotic NSSs and could be
foundational for understanding how the presence of disease-linked mutations or exogenous molecules such as
amphetamine could disturb this mechanism.
 The laboratory of Dr. Hassane Mchaourab specializes in revealing the conformational dynamics of
transporters, including bacterial homologs of NSS, utilizing the tools of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
Our collaborator, Dr. Eric Gouaux has expertise in the field of eukaryotic NSS proteins and has determined
several high-resolution structures of hSERT. Together, the mentorship of Dr. Mchaourab and the guidance of
Dr. Gouaux will enable the success of experiments outlined in my aims from mammalian protein expression and
purification through EPR data acquisition and analysis and culminating in mechanistic models that integrate high-
resolution structures with conformational dynamics."
10911336,"The public health crisis of overdose continues unabated in King County, WA, with over 500 deaths in 2020, 700
in 2021, and rates continuing to rise with vast disparities in those affected. Emergency Medical System providers
(EMS) are first to arrive at the scene of an overdose and are critical partners in care for people who use drugs.
We partnered with people who use drugs, EMS leadership, and community partners to collect pilot data and then
co-design EMS-delivered interventions tailored to reduce stigma and increase access to care for people who
use drugs. These interventions are being rolled out as the EMS Overdose Prevention Project (EMS-OPP), and
hold great potential to reduce racial disparities in access to evidence-based medical services and to improve
long-term outcomes. EMS-OPP includes training for all EMS providers on stigma reduction and trauma-informed
care, an EMS naloxone leave-behind program, and warm hand-off to a follow-up team for connecting to care.
King County EMS teams will adopt these programs iteratively, and plan to have 90% of teams participating by
2026. Although this provides an excellent opportunity to assess the effectiveness of EMS-OPP, currently no
investigation of patient-level, population-level, or equity impacts is planned. Thus, we will capitalize on the natural
experimental conditions using a concurrent triangulation mixed methods design to examine the impact of EMS-
OPP on racial disparities in health outcomes. Specifically, guided by Public Health Critical Race Praxis, we will
partner with people who use drugs and Public Health Seattle & King County to: 1) evaluate the effect of EMS-
OPP on racial disparities in patient-level experiences (e.g., discrimination in EMS interactions) and outcomes
(e.g., linkage to buprenorphine treatment) (Aim 1); 2) further evaluate EMS-OPP from the perspectives of Black,
Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native non-fatal overdose survivors using in-depth interviews (Aim
2); and 3) examine the impact of the EMS-OPP on racial disparities in population-level outcomes (e.g.,
connections to follow-up care) (Aim 3). Aims 1 involves the creation of a cohort of non-fatal overdose survivors
with recent EMS interactions, linking multiple data systems. Aim 2 uses a qualitative study design involving semi-
structured interviews with Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and American Indian/Alaska Native survivors from Aim 1. Aim
3 uses data from the EMS Records Management System data using an interrupted time series design comparing
disparities in overdose outcomes for patients treated EMS-OPP-trained teams vs. not. In response to the
escalating overdose crisis, and racial disparities in outcomes, state governments have expanded EMS funding,
training, and scope of practice. Our proposed study capitalizes on this key moment in the opioid crisis to assess
the population-level and equity impact of a structural community-level intervention with real-world complexities
that has the potential for spread and scale. Findings will be shared in community venues (e.g. posters, community
zine), policy briefs, conference presentations, and academic journal articles.

10910177,"Sleep, breathing, hemodynamic oscillations, and cerebrospinal fluid movements – Building toward a
novel treatment approach for Alzheimer's disease
 Sleep deficiencies/problems are common in Alzheimer's disease with several hypothesized connections
to the movement of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. For example, within Alzheimer's disease the
accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau proteins may reflect inefficiencies in neuro-metabolic waste clearance
during sleep (a glymphatic system process that is intricately linked with CSF movement). Within
neurodegenerative research, the circulation of CSF has hypothesized links to several biological/physiological
processes (e.g., sleep, hemodynamic oscillations, breathing); however, we are limited in our understanding of
how to potentially improve CSF movement and neuro-metabolic waste clearance to ultimately slow the
progression of Alzheimer's disease. The present study fills these critical gaps by (1) quantifying sleep-coupled
CSF movement and (2) documenting how CSF movement is coupled with other (more easily assessed and
manipulated) biological signals (i.e., hemodynamic oscillations, breathing). The overarching goals of this line of
work are to improve our understanding of CSF movement and how this knowledge can be leveraged to slow the
progression of Alzheimer's disease.
 Unlike blood circulation, CSF has no `engine' to drive its flow; therefore, changes in cerebral blood volume
(CBV) likely serve as a `driver' of CSF movement. Previous research demonstrates that increases in CBV can
be neuronally driven (e.g., sleep); arterial pulsation driven; or breath driven (e.g., meditation/guided breathing).
However, we do not understand the magnitude of these changes/couplings. Improving CSF
movement/circulation for individuals with Alzheimer's disease has the potential to slow the pathology progression
and could prolong higher quality of life for the millions of Americans currently diagnosed.
  Aim 1: Assess the degree of coupling between cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral spinal fluid
 (CSF) movement during wake and sleep states.
  Aim 2: Assess the relative contributions of breathing oscillations on CBV and CSF fluctuations during
 wake and sleep states."

Candidate: Maria I. Carlo, MD is an Assistant Attending in Medicine at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSK) with a dual appointment in the Genitourinary Oncology and Clinical Genetics services. Dr.
Carlo's clinical and research interests are in hereditary RCC, a cancer that has a poor prognosis when
identified in advanced stages. Under the mentorship of Kenneth Offit, MD, MPH and Ari Hakimi, MD she has
begun work to elucidate the role of KEAP1 in the susceptibility to RCC and to define the phenotype of RCCs
with KEAP1 mutations. Dr. Carlo's goal is to develop an independent laboratory to do translational work in the
genetic predisposition to RCC and its implication for cancer screening and targeted treatment.
Career Development Plan: Drs. Carlo, Offit, and Hakimi have developed a plan to ensure that Dr. Carlo has
the necessary training, mentorship, and support to effectively transition to an independent researcher who can
successfully lead genomic discovery studies in RCC. This plan entails formal courses in genetic epidemiology,
bioinformatics, and cancer modeling, informal collaborations with scientists from MSK laboratories, and training
with personnel from MSK core facilities. Dr. Carlo has organized an Advisory Committee with expertise
relevant to her proposal, and they will guide her in successfully completing the goals of her proposed research.
Dr. Offit and the Advisory Committee will also guide Dr. Carlo to ensure progress in the promotion process and
garnering independent research funding towards the end of the K08 award period.
Research Plan: Despite several known genetic RCC syndromes, the majority of familial RCC remains
unexplained. The proposed project will use a large cohort of 928 patients with RCC who have undergone
parallel tumor and germline targeted exome sequencing. In a subgroup of patients with RCC of unclassified
histology, germline and somatic predicted loss-of-function variants were identified in KEAP1, which encodes a
negative regulator of NRF2, the key activator of the antioxidant response pathway. These tumors are
histologically similar to Fumarate Hydratase (FH)-deficient RCCs, which arise from germline mutations in the
FH gene. Loss of function of FH or KEAP1 can activate the NRF2 pathway. Dr. Carlo hypothesizes that,
similar to FH, KEAP1 loss-of-function germline variants increase risk of RCC, and mutations in KEAP1
contribute to the development of RCC in an NRF2-dependent manner. Dr. Carlo aims to (1) characterize
KEAP1-mutated RCC using genomic, transcriptomic and metabolic techniques, and (2) delineate the
effects of KEAP1 and FH mutations on malignant transformation in RCC model systems. The overarching
goal is to elucidate the role and implications of germline and somatic KEAP1 mutations in RCC to direct cancer
screening and develop rational targeted therapies."

 Seasonal influenza (“flu”) remains a serious public health threat with the highest burden of severe disease
and complications affecting older adults, particularly those over age 75. In addition to vaccine itself, responses
to vaccination and vaccine effectiveness in older adults are likely influenced by comorbidity (e.g., frailty),
immune senescent remodeling (i.e., immunosenescence and inflammaging), repeated annual vaccination,
intra-seasonal immune waning, and virus strain variations both in vaccine formula and in circulation.
 Since 2014, we have established a study cohort in community-dwelling older adults >75. The cohort has
accumulated 815 person-seasons with comprehensive demographic, clinical, functional and laboratory data, as
well as banked pre- and post-vaccination serum, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
samples. We also identified 15 breakthrough flu infection cases with banked post-infection serum, plasma and
PBMC samples. Importantly, 20 subjects participated in all 7 seasons, 36 in 6 seasons, 31 in 5 seasons, 16 in
4 seasons, and 165 in 3 seasons or less. Here, we propose to leverage this unique cohort and employ cutting
edge immunologic research tools to develop state-of-the-art “immune signatures” reflecting both general
immune status (distribution and function of immune cell subsets through high-dimensional flow analysis and
RNA-Seq; cytokine profiling) and influenza-specific immunity (breadth and depth of flu-specific T cell repertoire;
distribution/function of homotypic/heterotypic anti-flu T cells through flow analysis and scRNA-Seq; deep
serological profiling of strain-specific and cross-reactive flu antibodies). Our objective is to characterize
immune signatures and their intra- and inter-seasonal changes over time as determinants of vaccine
responses and risk of breakthrough infection in older adults >75. Our specific aims are: 1) Characterize
seasonal baseline (pre-existing) immune signatures as determinants of vaccine response and how
they change over time. We will not only determine inter-season longitudinal trajectory, but also identify
specific baseline immune signatures predict responses to vaccination; 2) Characterize seasonal immune
signature responses to vaccination as determinants of risk of breakthrough infection and how they
change over time. We will evaluate and compare differences and similarities of immune signature responses
elicited by vaccination vs natural infection to explore immune mechanisms of vulnerability; and 3) Characterize
intra-seasonal waning of immune signature responses to vaccination and its change across seasons
through monthly blood sampling until the end of each flu season across multiple seasons.
 Upon completion, the proposed studies will advance our understanding of immune signatures as key
immunologic mechanisms for vaccine responses and risk of breakthrough infection in a typical geriatric
population. Ultimately, these studies will help define correlates of protection and develop more effective
immunization strategies including a universal vaccine for this highly vulnerable subset of older adults."

This application is a request for continuation of support for a pre-doctoral Training Program in Virology at Yale
University. The goal is to provide multidisciplinary research training to predoctoral students in the molecular
biology of viruses, virus-host interactions, and pathogenesis in human viral diseases. This is expected to
provide the intellectual and research foundations necessary for productive careers in virology-related
disciplines in academia, industry, and government. The program offers training in virtually all aspects of
modern virology including viral genetics, the molecular, cellular and structural biology of viruses, adaptive and
innate immune response to viruses, virus-host interactions at the cellular and organismal levels as well as
translational research towards the treatment of viral diseases. The program is co-directed by Drs. Priti Kumar
and Walther Mothes, and a 5 member Advisory Committee. The program has been strengthened by the
addition of new Faculty trainers and courses to cover emerging critical areas of virology. As a group, the 22
trainers have an outstanding record of research accomplishment and training and many are national or
international leaders in their fields. These trainers have primary appointments in 14 different Yale departments
and currently have 51 predoctoral virology trainees working in their labs.
 Students enter the program through the Combined Program in Biological and Biomedical Sciences
(BBS). The BBS unites nearly 375 faculty in basic biological and biomedical sciences at the Yale Medical
School, Science Hill on the main University Campus, and the newly developed West Campus. Admission is
granted to students with outstanding academic record with particular attention to research experience. The
Faculty makes extensive efforts to attract and retain trainees from diverse backgrounds, particularly under-
represented minority groups. The program is supported by strong institutional commitment to graduate training.
Predoctoral training leading to the Ph.D. degree involves formal course work and laboratory rotations in the
first year. This provides a solid and broad conceptual foundation and experimental training in microbiology,
immunology, cell biology, genetics, as well as other areas of biology. Students select a research advisor at the
end of the first year and defend a research proposal in a qualifying exam at the beginning of the second year.
A Thesis Committee monitors student progress throughout the thesis research process. Intensive training in
the methods, logic, and responsible conduct of research are supplemented with a wide array of opportunities
for teaching and scientific interactions. The median time to obtain the Ph.D. degree is 5.4 years. This
application requests funding to continue support for four predoctoral trainees in each year, with each trainees
supported by this grant for a maximum of two years."

Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to an infection and can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome
(MODS). There are no effective treatments for sepsis-induced MODS most likely because of the heterogeneity
of the syndrome. Delineating MODS endotypes and molecular signatures of organ failures may lead to a better
understanding of the mechanisms involved in sepsis heterogeneity and allow for personalized treatment
strategies. It is difficult, however, to obtain clinical specimens from critically ill patients that would enable
investigations into organ-specific mechanistic changes. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are spherical microparticles
enclosed by bilayer phospholipid membranes. Exosomes or small EVs (sEVs) are a subtype of EV formed by
endosomal biogenesis. Small EVs can be released from almost any cell type into a variety of bodily fluids and
contain many cellular components. The cell-specific cargo can serve as cell-to-cell communicators and be taken
up by distant cells which can affect the inflammatory profile. Our preliminary data show that sEVs harvested from
serum of pediatric patients with sepsis have a distinct pro-inflammatory trait compared to sEVs of children without
sepsis and in vitro sEVs from septic patients can induce atypical inflammatory responses in immune cells. Since
circulating sEVs manifest characteristics of the cell of origin, they have been used as liquid biopsy. Thus, sEVs
hold potential as useful biomarker for organ-specific changes. There are no available biorepositories of sEVs for
pediatric sepsis research, in part, because of the lack of standardized methodology for sEV isolation. The overall
goal of our proposal is to establish standardized procedures for reliable biorepositories for sEV biomarker
research in critically ill patients with sepsis. This proposal will prove the hypothesis that quality and consistency
of isolation and purification protocols of plasma and serum samples enable setting-up reliable biorepositories for
future research on sEVs in sepsis. We will take advantage of two large critical care-division based repositories
which has biospecimens from pediatric critically ill septic and non-septic studies. The R21 phase Aim 1 is to
develop a methodology for sample collection and isolation of sEVs with high yield and purity and Aim 2 is to
demonstrate suitability of banked sEVs for high throughput analyses of RNA cargo profile. Once milestones for
the R21 phase are met we will proceed to the R33 phase to retrospectively characterize sEV endotypes in
critically ill patients with specific organ injuries (Aim 3) and then prospectively determine whether patients can
be classified based on their sEV characteristics. Results from these investigations will allow for the novel
development of a biorepository of sEVs in pediatric sepsis. This biorepository will enable investigators to explore
organ-specific molecular signatures for mechanistic studies of sEVs."

Prescription opioids, such as oxycodone, remain a common treatment for pain disorders. Although effective in
the short-term, long-term use can result in tolerance, dependence and fatal overdose. While oxycodone is not
the primary driver of fatal overdoses from opioids, the exposure to and subsequent withdrawal from oxycodone
can lead susceptible individuals to relapse, potentially substituting intake fentanyl or other more potent
synthetic opioids. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of oxycodone-induced withdrawal will provide a better
foundation for the treatment of opioid use disorder. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is an integrative
brain region that contributes to the generation of negative affective states. Prior work has demonstrated
increased neuronal excitability within the CeA in rodent models of morphine withdrawal, and inhibition or lesion
of the CeA resulted in a reduction of the aversive, and, to a lesser extent, somatic withdrawal behaviors from
morphine. Most studies investigating the CeA’s role in opioid withdrawal have done so in a global sense,
ignoring potential contributions of specific cell types to the manifestation of opioid withdrawal behaviors. The
central hypothesis in the present application is that activation of molecularly distinct neuronal subpopulations
within the CeA are necessary and sufficient for the expression of somatic opioid withdrawal and contribute to
future drug seeking behaviors. Uncovering the specific subtypes responsible for the expression of opioid
withdrawal has the potential to lead to a more effective and specialized approach for the development of
treatments of opioid use disorder. To this end, I will employ the use of targeted recombination in active
populations mice, which express the tamoxifen-dependent CreERT2 recombinase from the Fos promoter to
gain genetic access to oxycodone withdrawal activated (OWA) neurons. Using this strategy, I propose to
evaluate the activity of OWA during oxycodone withdrawal and evaluate their contributions to the expression of
behaviors related to somatic withdrawal and negative affect. In Aim 2, I will seek to use both known probes and
single-cell RNA sequencing to identify CeA neuronal populations preferentially activated during oxycodone
withdrawal. In the independent (R00) phase I will evaluate different subpopulations of CeA neurons based on
hits from Aim 2. Highly enriched projections and genes will be evaluated for their ability to influence behaviors
pertaining to oxycodone withdrawal and seeking. These experiments will provide me with an outstanding
technical skillset and an enriched data set to build the foundation of my independent research program
studying the framework of the CeA during opioid dependence and withdrawal. The results of these
experiments will provide a clearer understanding of the CeA’s role during opioid withdrawal, potentially to
leading to more targetable treatments for opioid use disorder."
10913562,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. While cannabis, nicotine, and alcohol remain the most widely endorsed
substances during adolescence, mechanistic pathways by which the social determinants of health influence
substance use outcomes among youth are unclear. Structural racism and discrimination results in poorer
quality environments in many neighborhoods within the United States, with a greater disproportionate impact
for marginalized populations. Neighborhood-level structural racism (NSR) is the totality of ways by which
structural racism disproportionately disadvantages neighborhoods in areas of socioeconomic conditions,
environmental health, and educational opportunities. NSR features, such as neighborhood inequities in access
to healthy food, green space, housing, and poverty rates, comprise important social determinants of health that
negatively affect neurocognitive skills as well as increase the risk for more negative consequences of
substance use. This project will use a concurrent mixed method approach to investigate the impact of
neighborhood-level structural racism on youth substance use and determine the extent this relationship is
mediated by neurocognitive markers of decision-making and distress tolerance. We will use both qualitative
and quantitative methods throughout the project to study NSR influences on SU in middle school youth (ages
12-14 years) in the R61 phase and in high school youth (14-17 years) in the R33 phase. We will leverage the
availability of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development ® (ABCD) Study dataset (N = 11,880) to
concurrently conduct quantitative analyses to test the neurocognitive pathways on the influence of NSR.
Community engagement research approaches will be implemented throughout both the R61 and R33 phase
and include oversight from a Community Advisory Board and a Youth Advisory Board. During the R61 phase,
interviews with middle school Latino/a/x and Black youth (N = 30) will obtain youth perceived neighborhood-
level risk factors for substance use. The quantitative studies will then investigate whether NSR impact youth
cannabis, nicotine, and alcohol through neurocognitive pathways of decision-making and distress tolerance.
Qualitative and quantitative findings from the R61 phase will be triangulated to inform the precision of the NSR
for high school youth during the R33 phase. In addition, the R33 phase will use photovoice with high school
youth (N=30), a photographic technique to identify and represent neighborhood features youth perceive
contribute to engagement with substance use. Cohort effects will be tested by comparing findings from the high
school cohort (R61) with the middle school cohort (R61). Findings from the project will be disseminated to
community stakeholders and policy makers. In addition, findings may inform community-level interventions on
the neighborhood features that pose risk to adverse substance use trajectories, as well as at the individual-
level for neurocognitive interventions for substance use prevention."

This application from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) seeks continuation of funding for the
Learning for Early Careers in Addiction and Diversity (LEAD) for clinical researchers. Historically
underrepresented racial and ethnic minoritized groups (URGs) experience personal and institutional-level
barriers that may hinder the progression of their academic career, including obtaining independent NIH research
funding. Although all new investigators face difficulty securing NIH funding, and efforts are being made at the
NIH to address the challenges experienced by URGs, disparities persist. The overarching goal of LEAD is to
support the career advancement of URG scholars to increase diversity in NIH funding. The program continues
its mission to provide training to postdoctoral fellows and assistant professors from URGs with the primary goal
of increasing the number of NIH-funded URGs who conduct NIH-supported substance use and substance use
disorder (SUD) research. LEAD builds on the platform of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical
Trials Network (CTN), a network of scientists and healthcare organizations that offers a broad infrastructure for
multisite testing of science-based SUD therapies. During the next five years, LEAD will bring innovation by
enhancing mentor training for both scholars and mentors to increase effective mentoring of URG trainees.
Specific aims are to: 1) Match trainee scholars with senior scientists in the CTN who provide scientific mentoring,
sponsorship, and professional guidance; 2) fund pilot studies to provide Scholars with preliminary data to support
subsequent NIH applications; 3) assist Scholars in developing grant-writing skills and submitting competitive NIH
applications during the LEAD training period; 4) offer training in cultural tailoring of evidence-based treatments
and implementation research methods; 5) enhance skills for successful mentoring; and 6) foster a networking
structure to build relationships with leading experts in SUD clinical trials research. Scholars participate in 3 years
of training, including an annual 4-week summer intensive program of courses and workshops at UCSF, mentoring
and training during the academic year, and participation in CTN national research and training meetings.
Scholars are matched with CTN senior investigators who mentor them through the 3-year training period as well
as with a Diversity Advisor and a separate UCSF Mentor. A successful NIH award for research or career
development is the key measurable outcome for participating Scholars. The program addresses the need for
URG investigators who have expertise in conducting SUD treatment research that impacts healthcare policy and
practice. The long-term goals address disparities in NIH funding for URGs and diversity of the scientific workforce
in the addictions field."
10742930,"ABSTRACT: The overall goal of this research program is to delineate the role of germline
epigenetic alterations (epimutations) in the onset and progression of inter-and transgenerational
reproductive defects. So far, published scientific literature suggests that environmentally induced
epigenetic alterations, mainly DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA modifications
(epitranscriptome), are transmitted to subsequent generations via germline (eggs or sperm)1.
However, the role of observed epimutations in the development of reproductive phenotypes is not
well understood because of a lack of clear understanding of PGC to germline and germline-to
soma transfer of reprogramming-resistant epimutations during the turnover of generations. Here
in the proposed study, we are asking three big questions: a) Do germline epimutations establish
age and developmental stage specifically in males? b) Do ancestrally established
transgenerational epimutations predispose future generations to increased risks for reproductive
impairment if exposed again to emerging environmental chemicals of concern? c) Is the role of
the observed epimutations in the development of progression of phenotypic traits causative or
correlative? This R01 research project will systematically answer these questions in three different
aims. BPA will be used as a ubiquitous model endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC), and
Bisphenol S (BPS) will be used as an emerging contaminant of concern, and medaka fish as a
comparative vertebrate animal model. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that male germ cells at all
stages of development are susceptible to BPA, the model EDC. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
exposure of the F3 generation offspring with pre-existing epimutations to emerging contaminants
will result in an increased incidence of reproductive impairment. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis
that the EDC-induced epimutations are associated with reduced fertility in males and females and
that these epimutations can be corrected by reprogrammable CRISPR-dCas9 epigenome editing
in vivo. The project will identify footprints of the past exposure, determine the role of
epimutations in reproductive impairment, determine whether inherited epimutations predispose
current and future generations to increased risks of reproductive health due to exposure to
emerging contaminants of concern, and provide significant insights into mechanisms underlying
germline transmission of the epigenome and longitudinal health risks of exposure. Understanding
of key time points during which epimutations transfer would provide insights into strategies for
the mitigation of future estrogenic chemical-induced reproductive health effects in humans."

 Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality rates are the highest in African American (AA) men
compared to any other racial/ethnic population. These differences persist even after accounting for
socioeconomic factors, suggesting genetics and unknown biological factors may contribute to PCa health
disparities. However, common genetic alterations, such as TMPRRSS2-ERG gene fusions and PTEN loss,
were found to occur much less frequently in AA PCa than in European American (EA) PCa. Instead,
prominent differences in tumor immunobiology between AA vs. EA men were reported in several studies,
including a clinical trial with a cancer vaccine, Sipuleucel-T, which AA men had a median nine-month of overall
survival advantage over EA men.
 To mechanistically dissect the immunological and/biological factors that determine tumor cell sensitivity
and resistance to immunotherapy of different races, we have developed primary cultures of AA and EA PCa
patient-derived tumor organoids, normal organoids, carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and benign-
associated fibroblasts (BAFs) from many patients and cryopreserved their peripheral blood lymphocytes
(PBLs) from the same patient over past years.
 Our preliminary data show that AA CAFs secrete increased levels of active TGF- in the culture
medium than EA CAFs. In addition, we are the first to show that Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant
(GARP), the docking receptor for the release of active TGF-β, is over expressed in the adjacent stroma
of AA PCa compared to adjacent stroma of EA PCa and AA PCa tissues. Interestingly, the adjacent stroma of
AA PCa has increased infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+T cells compared to the adjacent stroma of EA PCa and to
the distant stroma of AA PCa, suggesting that immune response is higher in AA stroma but may not be
effective due to the increased TGF-β1 and GARP. Our preliminary data of co-culture studies with CAFs
and T cells lends further support to the scenario as we observed increased TGF-β1 and reduced IFN-
 in these co-cultures.
 These results suggest that although AA PCa patients may be more responsive to immunotherapies,
GARP/TGFβ signaling represents a vulnerable point in AA PCa and may be used as a target for developing
more effective immunotherapies. Therefore, we hypothesize that the interaction between tumor and stroma
in AA and EA PCa differentially affect the tumor reactivity of T cells and that GARP/TGF-β signaling
contribute to the differences in the T cell tumor reactivity among patients.
 To test the hypothesis, first we will determine whether T cells from AA and EA PCa patients display
differences in tumor reactivity in co-cultures with autologous tumor organoids and/or CAFs. Second, our
preliminary data have shown that Dabigatran etexilate, an anticoagulant drug for preventing stroke in people
with atrial fibrillation, effectively blocks GARP/TGF-1 signaling and that its combination with anti-CTLA4
results in a durable regression of Myc-CaP xenograft tumors. We therefore will determine whether
Dabigatran can enhance the anti-PD1/anti-CTLA4’s anti-PCa efficacy in the HiMyc and TRAMP transgenic
PCa mouse models. Third, to further enhance the clinical relevance of our study, we will utilize available
formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks from 141 AA and 141 EA matched PCa cases by age and
Gleason score and determine the relationship between GARP/TGF-β signaling and various infiltrating immune
cells in tumor and stroma of AA and EA PCa.
 Impact: This proposal capitalizes on the development of unique organoids and cell resources, which
allow dissecting factors and mechanisms (i.e. GARP/GARP/TGF-β) signaling leading to immune differences
between AA and EA PCa. In addition, a novel strategy for enhancing immune checkpoint therapies in PCa in
general and AA PCa in particular may be developed by repurposing Dabigatran etexilate through targeting
GARP/TGF-β signaling that is highly activated in the tumor microenvironment of AA PCa, as suggested by
our preliminary data. Dabigatran etexilate has shown similar safety profiles or side effects as Aspirin
in humans."

 Aortic dissection and aneurysmal disease accounts for over 10,000 deaths in the United States each
year, and 1-2% of all deaths in Western countries. Consistent with prior studies that reveal that tight regulation
of the TGFβ signaling pathways is essential for vascular development and the maintenance of the vessel wall,
our preliminary data suggest overactivity of this pathway contributes to aortopathy. In addition, our preliminary
proteomic data suggests activation of the PDGF pathway in two animal models of aneurysm and dissection.
 The Ucuzian lab, under the mentorship of Dr. Strickland, has utilized two murine models of aortic disease
to identify several dysregulated pathways associated with aortopathy: 1) a smooth muscle cell specific LDL
receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) deficiency model; and 2) a lysyl oxidase (LOX) inhibition model using the drug
-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Exciting preliminary data by the Ucuzian and Strickland labs has identified a novel
finding that mild aerobic exercise attenuates the aortopathy associated with both smLRP1 deficiency and LOX
inhibition. The objectives of this proposal are to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which aneurysms and
dissections develop, and to investigate exercise intervention to attenuate these processes. We will utilize both
a mouse models of aortopathy and a human subject study to address these questions.
Specific Aim 1. To define mechanisms underlying the development of aortic disease using two mouse
models of aortopathy. The hypothesis is that smLRP1 and LOX protects against the development of aortic
aneurysm and dissection by attenuating TGF and/or PDGF mediated signaling events.
Specific Aim 2. To define mechanisms by which mild aerobic exercise attenuates the development of
aortic disease using two mouse models of aortopathy. The hypothesis is that exercise prevents aortic
aneurysm and dissection formation by attenuating TGF and/or PDGF mediated signaling events.
Specific Aim 3. To identify dysregulated molecular pathways in patients presenting with ascending
aortic aneurysms and Type A dissections. The primary hypothesis is that TGF signaling will be activated
in human subjects presenting with thoracic aneurysms and dissections. The secondary hypothesis is that the
presence of these pathway disturbances will correlate with the severity and extent of aortic disease
presentation.
 The long-term goals of Dr. Areck Ucuzian, the trainee, is to become an independent physician-scientist
in the field of Vascular Biology. His short-term goal is to cultivate the skills and experience required of a
researcher to become an independent clinician-investigator. The current proposal focuses specifically on a
fundamental mechanism of vessel wall homeostasis which prevents a broad range of vascular diseases. The
Aims of this study are planned to be completed at the Center for Vascular and Inflammatory Diseases (CVID)
and the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) under the mentorship of Dr. Dudley Strickland, PhD."

Hypersomnolence (HYP), or excessive daytime sleepiness, is the most common symptom encountered in
sleep medicine, and can present as linked to other medical disorders or independently. Discriminating
among the multiple possible causes of HYP is a complex process, and the underlying cause is often
unknown. Furthermore, there are currently no reliable electrophysiological parameters or biomarkers for
HYP, which is a severe limitation to the diagnostic and therapeutic process. Understanding the
biophysical presentation of HYP in sleep brain dynamics is essential to both the identification of reliable
electrophysiological biomarkers and to building a mechanistic understanding of the physiological
manifestations of HYP.
Most studies of sleep EEG dynamics focus on rhythms uniformly grouped by their dominant frequency,
sometimes addressing their spatial presentation, but overall ignoring the articulation of sleep rhythms in
space-time organized events. In recent work on typical adult populations the PI has introduced data-
driven techniques that reveal the space-time patterns of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles, both sleep
rhythms cardinal to sleep homeostasis, with SOs explicitly tied to the restorative-ness of a night of sleep.
This research line has also shown that differentiation of sleep rhythms in space-time patterns is a powerful
approach to revealing biophysical differentiation among events classified as the same “rhythm”
suggesting their potential differential contribution to sleep functions. Here, we propose to apply these
data-driven approaches to describe in detail the space-time presentation of HYP in sleep brain dynamics,
in order to determine HYP biomarkers and to advance our understanding of the manifestations of HYP in
brain activity important to health and cognition.
This study will re-analyze a well-characterized dataset including the sleep studies of persons with HYP
and controls, with both groups also articulated based on presence/absence of major depressive disorder.
Specifically, we will describe the space-time patterns of SOs and spindles on the scalp and their main
biophysical properties, comparing them among the HYP and control group (aim 1). We will then use
machine learning classification to determine for each individual the estimated cortical-subcortical currents
that most differentiate SOs space-time types, compare the results in HYP and controls (aim 2). Finally,
we will statistically evaluate the link between these biophysical quantifiers of space-time sleep patterns
and clinical/behavioral assessments of HYP symptoms, depression, and anxiety. This research will lead to
new insights into potential brain mechanisms that underlie HYP, as well as refined diagnostic and future
therapies for the multitude suffering with HYP disorder."

 This NIMHD Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K23) for Dr.
Allyn Bove, an Assistant Professor of Physical Therapy at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, will establish Dr. Bove as an independent health equity
investigator with expertise in health disparities in musculoskeletal rehabilitation and use of
implementation science methods to trial strategies to mitigate disparities. The proposed
research aligns with several of NIMHD’s research interests related to clinical and health
services research. This multi-level health services research project aligns with NIMHD’s goals to
pursue “multilevel interventions” that seek to “increase health equity” and “improve access to or
quality of care for populations affected by health disparities”. It also aligns with NIMHD’s pursuit
of “research to understand barriers and facilitators to the adoption of and adherence to
evidence-based practices and interventions in healthcare settings”.
 The research proposed in this four-year K23 award will occur in three phases. In the first
aim, we will engage with provider and patient partners to identify barriers and facilitators to
implementing optimal post-arthroplasty rehabilitation care pathways designed to improve
outcomes and mitigate outcomes disparities based on patient race and income/insurance
status. In the second stage, we will combine our preliminary data with information from Aim 1 to
develop an evidence-based approach for equitable implementation of optimal rehabilitation care
pathways to reduce disparities in community-based rehabilitation and physical function after
arthroplasty. In the final step, we will pilot test implementation of these evidence-based novel
rehabilitation care pathways. This work is important because it will progress rehabilitation
disparities research beyond simply identifying differences toward designing and implementing
novel interventions to reduce disparities and improve patient outcomes.
 The proposed work draws on Dr. Bove’s prior research on health disparities, qualitative
research methodology, and rehabilitation for individuals with osteoarthritis and joint arthroplasty.
This work will extend Dr. Bove’s work into the development and implementation of multi-level
interventions to address health disparities in this population. Upon conclusion of the proposed
research, formal training and mentorship outlined in this K23 application, Dr. Bove will be well-
positioned to seek R01 funding for a large hybrid effectiveness/implementation trial of these
care pathways that are designed to maximize function and promote equity in outcomes after hip
and knee arthroplasty surgery."

 Pertussis (aka whooping cough) is a serious, re-emerging public health concern despite
available vaccines. The acellular vaccine against Bordetella pertussis, used in the U.S. since the
1990s, prevents serious disease, but not colonization or transmission, resulting in a larger reservoir
from which infants, who are most vulnerable, can be infected. New vaccines that protect against both
colonization and disease are needed.
 The BvgAS and PlrSR two-component systems control Bordetella virulence. The BvgAS
two-component regulatory system (TCS) has long been considered the master regulator of Bordetella
virulence. It controls production of all know protein virulence factors, including those in the acellular
vaccine. We discovered another TCS, called PlrSR, that is essential for Bordetella viability and for
BvgAS activity in the lower respiratory tract (LRT). We found that PlrSR is required for LRT infection
even when BvgAS is constitutively active, indicating that PlrSR controls expression of unidentified but
critical virulence functions independently of BvgAS. These currently unknown virulence factors
could serve as therapeutic targets or new vaccine components, and hence their identification
is critical for controlling pertussis in the future.
 Drs. Cotter and Julio are experts in Bordetella pathogenesis and molecular biology, and Dr.
Bourret is an expert in TCS biochemistry. Together, we have characterized PlrS and PlrR proteins
biochemically and have discovered a way to bypass the apparent essentiality of plrS in vitro so that
we can construct strains to collect gene expression data without knowing the stimuli sensed by PlrS.
In Aim 1, we will identify genes regulated by PlrSR using RNA-Seq to reveal positive or negative
regulation, and ChIP-Seq to reveal direct or indirect regulation. In Aim 2, we will investigate PlrSR
signaling by making reporter fusions to key PlrSR-regulated genes and assessing responses to
physiologically relevant stimuli, as well as the consequences of using PlrS lacking PDC or PAS
sensory domains.
 Identification of the PlrSR regulon is low risk/high reward and will lay the foundation for a
R01 project. The proposed methods are well-established, suggesting a high probability of achieving
our Aims. Identifying the PlrSR regulon will be transformative in understanding Bordetella
pathogenesis and enable a future R01 project in which we can determine (i) why PlrR is essential for
viability, (ii) the roles of PlrSR regulated gene products in LRT infection by Bordetella, (iii) how PlrSR
regulates gene expression, (iv) connections between the PlrSR and BvgAS TCSs, and (v) perhaps
gain insight into the stimuli sensed by PlrS."

Although opioid dependence and addiction continue to constitute a major health and economic burden, our
limited understanding of the underlying neurobiology limits better diagnostics and interventions. Dysregulation
of the mesocorticolimbic reward circuit is acknowledged to contribute to various aspects of drug addiction, with
alteration in the activity and output of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) known to
contribute to the rewarding aspects of drug use. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes
in VTA DA function remain relatively unexplored. Therefore, our overarching goal is to identify molecular
mechanisms in VTA DA neurons mediating long-term changes in drug reward that contribute to the persistence
of drug addiction. To this end, we used translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to identify gene
expression changes in mice that specifically occur in VTA DA neurons following chronic morphine exposure.
While we found approximately the same number of gene expression changes by morphine in our input and VTA
DA fractions, our RNA sequencing analysis found very little overlap between these datasets emphasizing the
importance of this approach to identify mechanisms in VTA DA neurons as these are likely obscured in whole
tissue analyses. We have validated gene expression changes via qPCR and intriguingly, we find that expression
of number of neuropeptides not traditionally described in the VTA are robustly induced by morphine exposure.
Neuromedin S (NMS) was of particular interest as it was enriched in VTA DA neurons, and its expression was
robustly increased following chronic morphine exposure. While a role for NMS neurons has been described in
the suprachiasmatic nucleus in circadian regulation, NMS function outside this structure has not been
characterized, making it a highly novel gene of study. It is known that the primary receptor with which NMS
interacts, neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMUR2), is expressed within the target regions of VTA DA neurons, such
as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, whether all VTA DA neurons express NMS, and their potential
functional impact has yet to be determined. Thus, in this application we seek to characterize the expression and
functional impact of VTA DA neurons that co-express NMS via completion of three specific aims: 1) identify the
VTA DA neurons that express NMS and their projection sites, 2) determine whether modulation of VTA NMS
neuronal activity alters morphine-elicited behavior, and 3) determine if NMS knockout in VTA DA neurons alters
morphine-elicited behavior. Our studies will utilize cell type-specific CRISPR-mediated deletion to manipulate
the output of these novel VTA NMS-expressing neurons to assess their functional role in adult mice along with
transgenic mice and DREADDs to identify and alter VTA-NMS neuron activity. Critically, our new preliminary
data suggest that activation of VTA-NMS neurons affects morphine-elicited behavior, supporting the premise
and feasibility. These studies are expected to set the stage for future work investigating the role of specific VTA-
DANMS circuits, their activity during behavior, and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention."

Urothelial carcinoma is a common, aggressive, morbid, and understudied disease. Many patients are not cured
with the current standard of care for localized muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma, which is neoadjuvant
combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by radical cystectomy. But overall survival is significantly
longer in patients who obtain a pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that
intensification of systemic therapy will improve survival. It is critical that we develop reliable predictive biomarkers
that can select patients that will or will not have a complete pathologic response to receive, respectively, either
chemotherapy or an intensified peri-operative regimen. Preliminary evidence in urothelial carcinoma and other
cancers suggests that infiltrating immune cells play a role in treatment response, but this has not been rigorously
studied in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma. In this study, we will interrogate pre- and post-treatment
samples from a completed, pivotal phase II clinical trial, harnessing our expertise in spatial transcriptomics and
proteomics to interrogate differential gene and protein expression in tumor, immune, and stromal cells in
annotated tissue specimens before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without a checkpoint inhibitor.
Specifically, we will evaluate baseline CD8:FOXP3 ratio and responses to therapy (Aim 1), determine the effect
of neoadjuvant therapy on CD8:FOXP3 ratio (Aim 2), and leverage the full capacity of spatial
transcriptomic/proteomic assays to develop and evaluate the performance of novel predictive biomarkers of
response to neoadjuvant therapy (Aim 3). This study will result in predictive biomarkers while concurrently
profiling the immune infiltrate composition and how it is influenced by treatment. The ultimate goal is to design
rational combination or sequential peri-operative regimens for biomarker-driven clinical trials to improve patient
survival and cure rates. The project will provide the candidate, Katharine Collier, MD, MSc, MSE, MS, with
training in rigorous quantitative methods, cutting-edge spatial molecular analyses, and high-dimensional
biomarker development. The proposal capitalizes on Dr. Collier’s quantitative background in Chemical
Engineering, clinical training in Medical Oncology, and formal training in clinical trial design, while providing an
opportunity to gain additional skills and knowledge in multi-omics techniques and data analyses, preclinical
studies, leadership, presentations, and grant writing. Dr. Collier is committed long-term to improving outcomes
for patients with genitourinary cancers as a translational physician-scientist. Dr. Collier will be supported by an
experienced mentorship team (Amir Mortazavi, MD, Zihai Li, MD, PhD, Daniel Stover, MD, Steven Clinton, MD,
PhD), skilled collaborators, the rich academic environment of the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer
Center, and an invested institution committed to providing protected time and resources for career development
and research. This award will ensure Dr. Collier’s successful transition to independence as a physician-scientist
and translational researcher improving outcomes for patients with genitourinary cancers."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia are one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders in
the aging population, affecting more than 1 in 10 people aged 65 and older each year in the United States alone.
Since AD is a slow and complex progressive brain disease, early identification of brain changes before the onset
of clinical symptoms is critical for minimizing brain tissue damage and improving the effectiveness of clinical
interventions.
 Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising tool for the early detection of AD because of its
non-invasiveness, wide availability, and sensitivity to subtle brain microstructural changes. Unfortunately, current
diffusion MRI techniques can be inadequate for several reasons, including (1) insufficient spatial resolution to
accurately delineate important but fine-scale white matter pathways in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), a critical
region in the early propagation of AD; and (2) a lack of specificity to reveal the underpinning brain microstructural
changes from early neuronal injury and dysfunction. The innovation of this proposal mainly lies in the joint use
of SNR-efficient high-resolution diffusion acquisition and advanced diffusion encoding strategies to effectively
address the accuracy and specificity limitations of current diffusion MRI methods. Specifically, this project will (1)
develop a high-resolution MRI protocol for more accurate segmentation of white and gray matter regions that
are first affected by and play critical roles in AD propagation; (2) develop advanced diffusion encoding waveforms
for more sensitive and specific characterization of subtle brain microstructural changes at the early stage of AD;
and (3) use existing AD molecular biomarkers to rigorously evaluate the efficacy of the new diffusion biomarkers
for early AD detection.
 The outcomes of this proposal will lay the foundation for studying the longitudinal AD progression,
elucidating the underlying AD pathogenesis, and evaluating new intervention strategies to prevent and/or slow
down AD onset and/or progression. The candidate has a strong background and extensive training in MRI
physics, engineering, image processing, and brain imaging. With the additional training in cognitive neuroscience,
biostatistics, and multimodal neuroimaging provided by this program, he will be well equipped as an independent
researcher focusing on (1) developing advanced neuroimaging techniques with a strong focus on MRI; and (2)
employing a multimodal toolset to address fundamental questions in basic neuroscience research and
neurodegenerative disease studies."

We are requesting funds to purchase a Miltyeni MACSima imaging system. These new technologies allow for
researchers to apply single cell proteomic analysis to cells in their resident tissue environment. For our
investigators in the aging, cancer, immunology, and neuroscience research fields, the ability to advance
conventional imaging analyses to examine an order of magnitude more proteins would provide much deeper
insight into their scientific questions. Automation provided by this instrument will also allow more efficient and
rapid analysis of more samples. The advantages of this new technology include using conventional antibodies
already in use by the investigators and easy to use instrumentation. The resultant data can then be analyzed
using state-of-the-art single cell informatic approaches. For example, this instrumentation would allow aging
researchers at the OKC VAMC to identify senescent cells in a tissue section, determine what type of cell they
are and examine senescence associated secretory factor – all in the same tissue section. Additionally, flexibility
with the type of samples, human/laboratory animal, fixed/fresh frozen should allow the greatest number of
investigators to benefit from this instrumentation.
Iterative immunohistochemical imaging is the result of advances in antibody reporter technology, imaging, and
automated image analysis. This enables single cell proteomic studies heretofore no possible. Samples are
collected according to existing methods but can then be probed much deeper than with conventional imaging.
The specific MACSima technology was identified through a needs assessment and offers greater simplicity of
use and less method optimization as compared to mass cytometry and nucleic acid barcoding approach. This
MACSima enabling technology has wide application to studies at the Oklahoma City VA Center and will advance
variety or research programs.
A survey of all VA researchers at OKC VAMC showed a wide variety of researchers will utilize the system. This
instrument will be used by eight major users, and two junior investigator minor users with VA career development
and pilot funding. The projects that will be enhanced by this instrumentation represent a large number VA Merit
and career scientist grants."

I am a neurotologist and assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at
the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I am applying for a K08 mentored surgeon-scientist career
development award (CDA) to obtain further training related to chemical engineering-based approaches to
improving drug delivery in the ear for treatment of hearing loss. Specifically, I am interested in developing
magnetic nanoparticles as a novel drug delivery platform in the treatment of hearing loss. My long-term career
goals are to lead the translational development of novel drug delivery technologies that can enable the safe
and effective delivery of emerging pharmaceutics into the inner ear.
Despite rapid emergence of promising therapeutics such as protein-based neuronal growth factors and gene
therapies for various forms of sensorineural hearing loss, their clinical translation is limited by the lack of a
delivery vehicle that can be administered in a minimally-invasive and redoseable fashion in the clinic. Magnetic
nanoparticles have unique chemical and physical properties that may be well suited as a cochlear delivery
vehicle for macromolecular pharmaceutics. Their polymeric coating has payload capacity for proteins and
DNA, while their superparamagnetic iron oxide nanocores can move in a magnetic field gradient, allowing for
magnetically-assisted delivery across the round window membrane and into perilymph. However, rational
design of magnetic nanoparticles for cochlear drug delivery requires an understanding of how nanoparticle
properties relate to transport and pharmacokinetic behavior in the cochlea.
This CDA proposes leveraging my previous experience in translational engineering research of the inner ear to
elucidate how chemical and physical properties of custom-synthesized magnetic nanoparticles affect their
consequent transport properties as cochlear drug delivery vehicles in vitro and in vivo. Specific training goals
include: 1) training in nanoparticle science and drug delivery, 2) training in the guinea pig pharmacokinetic
model, and 3) training in immunohistologic and histologic assays of the temporal bone, 4) training in ethical
conduct of research, and 5) development of skills, techniques, and preliminary data that will lead to submission
of a successful R01 application.
The research plan investigates the hypothesis that nanoparticle size is an important mediator of magnetic
nanoparticle transport in the cochlea and performance as a drug delivery vehicle. Using a guinea pig model
validated for the study of perilymph pharmacokinetics of applied drugs, the specific aims of the proposal are to
understand the impact of nanoparticle size on 1) transport across round window membrane explants in vitro, 2)
perilymph concentration profiles and biodistribution in cochlear tissues in vivo, and 3) ability to deliver brain-
derived neurotrophic factor into cochlear perilymph in vivo."

 2 Rotaviruses (RVs) of group A (RVAs) remain an important cause of acute gastroenteritis and mortality in young animals
 3 and children. Despite their significance, mechanisms of RVA cell entry, replication and attenuation remain poorly
 4 understood indicating a critical need to address these knowledge gaps and design universal control approaches.
 5 We have previously conducted comparative sequence analysis that identified two key amino acid substitutions
 6 associated with cell culture adaptation and attenuation: D385N in the VP4 of most human and porcine RVA strains and
 7 D393H in porcine OSU strain VP4 only. While these or similar mutations were previously suggested to be important for
 8 cell culture adaptation/attenuation, their function has not been confirmed experimentally. Using our porcine intestinal
 9 enteroid (PIE) system, we have demonstrated that contrasting modes of interactions with the host glycans determine
10 replication efficacy of different RVA strains. OSU replication was uniquely and significantly down-regulated by the
11 removal of terminal sialic acids, while the latter significantly enhanced the replication of a novel porcine G9P[13] strain.
12 OSU is a historic dominant RVA variant characterized by robust in vivo and in vitro replication and consistently
13 associated with diarrheal disease in piglets for several decades, while G9P[13] and G9P[19] are recent, globally
14 emerging RVA variants in swine and humans. It is possible that the latter strains have evolved to acquire some biological
15 advantage allowing for their efficient spread and replication in different hosts. Virulent OSU and G9P[13] strains have
16 unique aa substitutions in the aa positions 385 and 393 of the VP4 hydrophobic loop, which could be a reason for
17 variable interactions with host glycans. Additionally, our recent study demonstrated that the host (PIE) transcriptome
18 response associated with OSU and G9P[13] infections differed drastically altering glycan expression, cholesterol
19 metabolism and innate immune signaling in a strain-specific manner. These findings suggest that evolutionary
20 adaptation of RVAs to the host and host glycans is a critical mechanism allowing for their interspecies (including
21 zoonotic) transmission.
22 Following a previously optimized protocol, our lab has successfully cloned 11 segments of virulent RVA OSU into the
23 pT7 plasmid and rescued infectious virus. We now propose to use this reverse genetics system for in-depth exploration
24 of the molecular mechanisms of RVA virulence, cell attachment and replication. The specific aims to achieve this goal
25 are summarized below:
26 Aim 1: Evaluate if the D385N and D393H substitutions (individually or in combination with other mutations in the OSU
27 VP4) introduced into OSU RGS (ic-virOSU) will confer an attenuated phenotype to the progeny virus (ic-attOSU). Aim
28 2: Evaluate if G9P[13]-like mutations (S385N and D393N) will confer the G9P[13]-like glycan specificity to the progeny
29 virus (ic-G9OSU). Aim 3: To conduct comparative transcriptome analysis of the wild-type (ic-virOSU) and mutant (OSU-
30 att and OSU-G9) OSU variants. Our PIE and Gn pig models as well as the newly established RGS will allow to study
31 how the identified VP4 mutations alter RVA virulence and the selective interactions with host glycans.

10930930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Climate change (CC) and related weather events are expected to impact intimate partner violence (IPV). Women
in informal settlements in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are more likely to be experiencing IPV,
less likely to have access to services, and more vulnerable to the effects of CC and related extreme weather
events (EWEs). Despite the potential impacts of CC on IPV, strategies to adapt to CC in these settlements, i.e.,
reducing the consequences of mounting climate challenges, have overlooked violence-related outcomes. In
particular, there is a paucity of interventions to help residents of informal settlements experiencing IPV to adapt
to or minimize the impact of CC on their safety and well-being. The purpose of this exploratory/developmental
R21/R33 study is to develop and test the preliminary efficacy of a smartphone-delivered climate adaptation safety
and harm reduction intervention for women experiencing IPV in informal settlements in Kenya using ecological
momentary intervention (EMI) and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). We will achieve this goal through
the following aims: R21: Aim 1 is to develop and pilot a smartphone-based application to collect real-time EMA
information about IPV experiences, emotional stress, IPV self-efficacy, receipt of IPV-related social support and
services, safety, climate-related comfort, social and environmental context, and current behaviors from 320 IPV
survivors in informal settlements. Participants will complete EMAs thrice daily for a two-week baseline period
and for two-weeks following three common types of EWEs (heatwave, cold spell, heavy rainfall). R21: Aim 2: is
to use AIM 1 data to explore important, but understudied associations between climate and IPV. R33: Aim 1 is
to adapt an evidence-based Wings of hope intervention (WINGS) for integration into the EMA application
developed in the R21 study. R33: Aim 2 is to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the event-triggered
WINGS-based EMI adapted in R33: Aim 1 through a randomized control trial (RCT). Participants retained from
the R21 phase (n=272), will be randomized to receive either a single-session, mobile version of WINGS (n=136)
or the event-triggered, WINGS-based EMI adapted in R33: Aim 1 (n=136). For nine months, participants
assigned to the event-triggered EMI will be prompted to participate in daily EMIs for two-weeks following EWEs.
They will also be prompted to complete daily EMAs during these two-week periods. All participants, regardless
of assignment, will be asked to complete digital assessments at baseline, immediately following receipt of the
single-session of WINGS, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-months. The goals of this study are: to provide women with a
low-cost, accessible, smartphone-based tool that empowers them to develop, utilize, and revise personal safety
and harm reduction strategies that are specifically responsive to climate-related IPV and to provide survivors
with interventions in real-time. Findings could support a low-cost, sustainable, and easily adaptable climate
adaptation and IPV response application and implementation model for informal settlements or other under-
resourced settings, globally."

 2 A primary goal of this K01 proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr. Alexander Lucas, with the expertise to become
 3 an independent investigator who is able to utilize state-of-the-art imaging techniques to evaluate subclinical
 4 outcomes that predict future cardiovascular (CV) events in cancer patients, and that respond to behavioral
 5 adaptations (i.e., exercise). Prostate cancer (PC) patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
 6 experience deleterious changes in CV risk factors (body composition, exercise intolerance, metabolic
 7 dysfunction). Exercise training interventions are an effective non-pharmacological approach for managing these
8 negative effects of treatment. Furthermore, the use of non-invasive methods to determine CV and
 9 musculoskeletal contributors to exercise capacity can inform the design of more precise exercise prescriptions
10 to address specific functional deficits in men initiating ADT. However, while supervised exercise training is
11 effective, many men lack access to such programs and establishing whether home-based behavioral exercise
12 programs can effectively improve exercise capacity (peak VO2) is important. Dr. Lucas’s preliminary data from
13 PC patients and other populations of cancer survivors support the feasibility and potential of exercise training to
14 limit treatment side effects. The proposed research project will provide critical data important for determining
15 whether exercise training leads to improvements in aerobic fitness (peak VO2), and whether central and/or
16 peripheral factors and components of body composition are key determinants of peak VO2 among men
17 undergoing treatment with ADT. Our primary hypothesis is that a combined aerobic and resistance training
18 intervention will improve peak VO2 by maintaining cardiovascular function, enhancing oxygen extraction at the
19 muscle, maintaining lean body mass, and reducing accumulation of fat mass. We propose a 2-arm, randomized
20 controlled trial to test a 12-week home-based and remotely delivered exercise intervention among
21 60 men undergoing ADT for intermediate to high-risk PC (Aim 1). We will use highly sensitive, non-
22 invasive cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques with cardiopulmonary exercise testing
23 (CPET) to test effects of the intervention. We will also determine the relative contribution of central and peripheral
24 components of peak VO2 and their association with body composition (Aim 2). Surveys and qualitative semi-
25 structured interviews will be conducted with men who complete or dropout of the intervention to assess
26 intervention acceptability and to refine both content and delivery of a future intervention to be tested in a larger
27 RCT. This work focuses on optimizing cardiovascular health in men diagnosed with prostate cancer – a growing
28 population. The proposed K01 will provide essential training for the candidate, who will work closely with an
29 expert mentoring team with regard to study design and execution and the Career Development Plan. A specific
30 goal of training is to also gain advanced skills in design and conduct of clinical trials thus supporting the
31 implementation of future programs aiming to improve health outcomes in diverse communities."
10893576,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are significant non-motor manifestations of Parkinson disease (PD) that can precede PD motor symptoms by years; cognitive dysfunction is an important late, non-motor manifestation. Braak’s hypothesis proposes that α-synuclein (αS) aggregates propagate along vagal or olfactory afferents to the central nervous system (CNS), leading to motor and non-motor features of PD. However, αS aggregates are also identified in enteric neurons in elderly people without PD. Squalamine prevention of αS aggregates improved constipation in PD. Density of nigrostriatal dopamine transporters (as assessed by 123I-FP-CIT SPECT) are relevant to cognitive processing in PD. αS oligomers in CSF is a marker of early synucleinopathies and αS protein misfolding in PD implies propagation from the gut to brainstem via the vagus nerve. The relationship between density of nigrostriatal dopamine or aS misfolding in gastrointestinal mucosa and the GI pathophysiology in human PD is unknown. To date, prior studies have typically addressed one pathological mechanism and one GI manifestation. Our multidisciplinary characterization of GI and neural phenotype in PD is key for this first study in 3 groups of humans of the mechanistic roles of the central neural circuitry, central dopamine receptors’ density, autonomic pathways, as well as αS expression in the gastrointestinal and colonic mucosa and microbiome in gut pathophysiology in human PD. Our overall hypothesis is that reduced nigrostriatal dopamine transmitter, autonomic dysfunction and increased αS expression or misfolding in the gastric, duodenal or sigmoid mucosa are associated with abnormal GI motor and barrier functions and with submucosal neuronal dopamine and αS expression in patients with PD with GI symptoms. We propose a prospective cohort design study with two aims in 3 groups, that is, PD patients with Hoehn and Yahr motor stages 1-3 with/without GI symptoms, and age-matched controls with n=24 per group: 
Aim 1: To compare GI motor functions (gastric emptying and accommodation, colonic transit, defecatory function), small bowel permeability, duodenal and stool microbiome and putative mechanisms (GI and sigmoid mucosal transcriptome, including αS misfolding, tight junction protein, and dopamine receptor expression). 
Aim 2: To quantitate nigrostriatal dopamine transporter expression, autonomic symptoms, and vagal and sympathetic functions using validated 123I-FP-CIT SPECT, COMPASS-31 questionnaires, and CASS scores, respectively and compare the central dopamine transporter expression and autonomic functions 
In sub-aims, we compare central and autonomic functions, GI transit and permeability, and mucosal αS mucosal expression or mis-folding in the 3 groups. The significance of the proposal lies in identification of mechanisms, and potential targets for future interventions directed to vagal and autonomic dysfunction, aggregation or misfolding of αS in gut mucosa, as well as dopamine expression to treat GI manifestations of PD."

Substance use disorder (SUD) and HIV are synergistic epidemics (syndemics) disproportionately affecting
Black Americans. Structural racism related to inadequate access to healthcare, stigma, and criminalization,
especially among those with intersectional identities related to gender and sexual minorities, further exacerbate
disparities in HIV and SUD outcomes.
SUD is often unrecognized and untreated among PLWH. Only about half of HIV care sites routinely screen and
refer to SUD treatment. In preliminary work, we found that nearly half of patients assessed in an HIV clinic
waiting room met criteria for a SUD, but 65% had not been diagnosed with SUD. A promising strategy to
address structural barriers to SUD screening for PLWH is use of electronic patient portals. Portals are secure
websites that give patients access to health information and allow for secure messaging with providers. They
are associated with improved health outcomes and patient engagement. Importantly, while most SUD
screening currently occurs during clinic visits, portals can be utilized for SUD screening to reach patients who
miss clinic visits, which is more common among people with HIV and SUD. Our preliminary work has
demonstrated the potential of the portal for use in a population health approach to behavioral health screening,
but minoritized populations are less likely to enroll in portals. Approaches are need to enhance engagement of
Black PLWH for utilization of the portal for SUD screening.
Beyond SUD screening, Black PLWH face structural barriers to SUD treatment, including the lack of treatment
centers in communities with higher proportions of Black residents. However, a new model of treatment
(Collaborative Care Model (CoCM)) integrates a social work care manager and consulting psychiatrist into the
primary setting and has been shown improve SUD outcomes. CoCM for SUD could address treatment barriers
related to stigma and structural racism for Black PLWH and SUD.
This proposal will implement and evaluate multi-level interventions to decrease barriers to SUD screening
(clinic-based, in-person) and treatment (referral-focused), a program we call ePORTAL HIV-S. ePORTAL HIV-
S will be implemented at the Chicago Department of Public Health-funded South Side Health Home (S2H2),
the main provider of HIV prevention and care services for Chicago’s South Side, a majority Black community
disproportionately impacted by HIV and SUD. Alongside our Community Advisory Board, we propose to carry
out 4 aims: 1) Design and implement a strategy to increase patient portal engagement among Black PLWH; 2)
Perform a randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness of population health vs. usual (clinic-visit) SUD
screening among PLWH in an HIV clinic; 3) Implement and evaluate CoCM for SUD in an HIV clinic; and 4)
Develop an implementation guide for external dissemination of ePORTAL HIV-S. Our ultimate goal is to
achieve health equity in SUD screening and treatment among Black PLWH."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
(WLH) bear a disproportionate risk of invasive cervical cancer (CC) due to greater
human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Despite the availability of effective
Women living with diagnosed HIV
CC screening methods, there is low CC screening uptake among WLH. Reasons for suboptimal CC screening uptake
among WLH are complex and multifactorial. Multilevel interventions that simultaneously address modifiable barriers to
screening at different levels of influences are therefore needed to effectively reduce CC disparities among WLH. To
achieve the World Health Organization’s recommended global target to eliminate CC by 2030, accelerated progress in
complex health problems may also likely come from the integration of social innovations and technological advances.
 The overall objective of this proposed K01 project is to conduct formative research and pilot test the provider-level
and patient-level components of the My Self-Sampling for HPV Awareness, Results, and Empowerment (MySHARE+)
intervention. MySHARE+ aims to harness the power of technology and apply a multilevel approach to promote the
adoption of CC screening (HPV self-sampling; Pap triage adherence) among under/never-screened WLH, a vulnerable
population. The specific aims are to: 1) identify facilitators and barriers to implementing a healthcare provider prompt in a
primary care setting and 2) conduct a pilot RCT to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a
mHealth educational intervention in promoting CC awareness and HPV self-sampling among WLH. These aims align
with the NCI’s mission to advance scientific knowledge to reduce the unequal burden of cancer and purposely addresses
their areas of research emphasis in biobehavioral research and in improving health disparities by targeting multiple levels
of influences. Study findings will generate implementation feasibility and acceptability data from the provider and patient
perspectives, and inform a subsequent R01 that will test the impact of the MySHARE+ intervention in a large cluster
randomized trial where the independent and overlapping effects of the different components can be evaluated.
 Strongly supported by mentors and advisors who are leading experts in the methodological and content areas specific
to her long-term goals, Dr. Le’s proposed K01 includes a comprehensive training plan that will help her acquire new
knowledge and advanced skills in: 1) quasi-experimental studies and cluster-RCTs using multilevel approaches, 2) digital
health/technology-based interventions to promote patient-centered care, and 3) implementation science methodologies and
frameworks. Over the 5-year award period, she will participate in mentored research, one-on-one and advisory/team
meetings, didactic instruction, directed readings, training seminars, and scientific meetings. The aforesaid research and
training activities will undoubtedly help Dr. Le achieve her overall academic career objective of leveraging academic-
community-government partnerships to successfully execute and sustain community-driven and clinically-embedded
intervention research supported by health information technology and the remote delivery of primary health care services
to enhance patient-centered care. GW is well poised to support Dr. Le in undertaking these research endeavors, especially
due to the expertise on faculty, its location and reputation in the city, and the institution’s high quality research setting."

The proposed research aims will provide support for a novel pathway of intergenerational trauma through new-
born amygdala network connectivity programmed in utero influencing infant emotion regulation problems that
may lead to less optimal mother-infant interactions (e.g., disorganized attachment), resulting in increased risk
for psychopathology. The proposed training will add to the applicants’ background in perinatal psychology and
developmental psychopathology to include needed training in newborn brain imaging and enable their future
independent career as a clinician-scientist with expertise in novel pathways of intergenerational trauma through
in utero programming of early brain-behavior leading to increased risk for psychopathology, informing critical
malleable windows for early intervention. In one study, 40% of children developed anxiety disorders when their
mother experienced childhood maltreatment (MCM), as compared to only 24% in the absence of MCM. Most
known pathways of transmission are behavioral, with limited evidence for biological transmission. Well-estab-
lished behavioral pathways are through maternal psychological state and parenting sensitivity influencing infant
emotion regulation and mother-infant attachment. Emerging evidence supports MCM effects on infant out-
comes through biological pathways such as in utero programming of brain development, e.g., MCM was asso-
ciated with greater newborn resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the amygdala and regions of
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and key brain networks implicated in stress processing. However, associations be-
tween MCM-influenced alterations in amygdala network connectivity with infant behavior or child outcomes
have yet to be established, limiting the clinical application of emergent literature. The candidate will address a
critical gap in the literature by investigating a novel biological pathway of intergenerational trauma: MCM-influ-
enced prenatal programming shaping newborn amygdala network connectivity prior to postnatal influences
(i.e., substantiating prenatal programming of MCM transmission), in association with infant emotion regulation
problems (i.e., making emergent research more clinically relevant), resulting in increased risk for psychopathol-
ogy. Mediators and moderators will also be considered, such as maternal prenatal psychological state, psycho-
social health, health behaviors, social determinants of health, infant health, and infant biological sex. The appli-
cant will obtain training in newborn functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), laboratory observational
assessment of infant behavior, theory and science of intergenerational trauma, and biostatistics. The K99/R00
will inform the candidate’s first R01 proposal with specific hypotheses about brain circuits associated with in-
fant emotion regulation problems and disorganized attachment as RDoC informed indicators of future risk for
child psychopathology, and guide decisions for obtaining subsequent fMRI and interdisciplinary longitudinal
multi-level assessment. Future R01s will build a research program to investigate novel pathways of intergener-
ational trauma through early brain-behavior programmed in utero leading to changes in infant and child social-
emotional development and family dynamics, with mediators and moderators prior to and throughout preg-
nancy, to help mitigate risk for intergenerational transmission of trauma and psychopathology. The K99/R00
will culminate in a successful transition to career independence."

Americans of African descent are more than four times as likely to reach end-stage renal disease than those of
European descent (2021 USRDS report). Acute kidney injury along with diabetes and hypertension are top risk
factors for developing end-stage renal disease. Acute kidney injury can be initiated via diabetic and/or
hypertensive events causing nephron injury, among other causes. New nephrons cannot regenerate after injury.
Following acute kidney injury, epithelial cells lining proximal tubules of the nephron can repopulate damaged
tubules to promote repair. However, a portion of cells fail to repair (termed failed-repair proximal tubule cells)
and express proinflammatory and profibrotic markers. Failed-repair proximal tubule cells are hypothesized to
cause local inflammation and fibrosis which can promote the acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease
transition, which leads to end-stage renal disease. Using single nucleus RNA-seq we identified a Traf2 and Nck
interacting kinase (Tnik) to be specifically expressed in failed-repair proximal tubule cells after acute kidney injury
in mice. In this MOSAIC K99/R00 career development proposal, Dr. Shayna Bradford aims to define the role of
Tnik in failed-repair proximal tubule cells using a novel mouse model with Tnik ablation specifically in renal
tubules. Additionally, she aims to use start-of-the-art single cell multiomic technologies to define the role of failed-
repair proximal tubule cells in the advanced acute kidney injury to chronic kidney disease transition in African
Americans. Dr. Bradford’s career goal is to be at the forefront of unraveling the molecular mechanisms of renal
health disparities in order to develop novel therapeutics to lessen gaps in renal health. Her career development
plan consists of gaining expertise in single cell biology and computation, in vivo modeling of renal injury and
regeneration, molecular determinants of health disparities, and in additional scientific training areas. She will
also continue to build professional Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion skills in order to promote safe and inclusive
training experiences in biomedical research. The K99 phase of the MOSAIC award will be carried out under the
direction of Dr. Benjamin Humphreys, a distinguished physician-scientist in renal disease research and single
cell biology at Washington University. The award will also be guided by an exceptional Faculty Advisory
Committee with expertise in multiomics, mouse models of renal regeneration, and health disparities. Washington
University is well known for excellence in research and has state-of-the art facilities and robust resources to
carry out the proposed studies and career development plans."
10899588,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Innate immune antiviral pathways are upregulated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and are thought to drive AD
pathogenesis. The specific mediators of maladaptive antiviral responses in AD are still not understood. Innate
immune system utilizes a series of nucleic acid sensors to detect viral genetic material to activate interferon
expression. The central DNA sensor in the cell is cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). cGAS signaling has
emerged as an important player in many neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. The role of cGAS signaling in tau-mediated neurodegeneration remains unstudied. We discover
that cGAS signaling is hyperactivated in the brains of mice expressing mutant tau (P301S mice) and human AD
patients. Using behavioral assays, electrophysiological readings and single nuclei RNA sequencing, our
preliminary results indicate that cGAS activity modifies both the cellular responses to and the functional deficits
caused by tauopathy. We observed that partial or complete loss of Cgas rescued tauopathy-associated spatial
learning and memory deficits. cGAS is highly enriched in immune cells including microglia. We find that tau
induces a cGAS-dependent interferon signature by triggering mitochondrial DNA stress in microglia and show
that Cgas deletion alters microglial disease transformation, characterized by reduced expression of interferon
genes in disease microglia. It is not known how tau can alter mitochondrial and nuclear dynamics to activate
cGAS and how cGAS activation enhances neurotoxic effects of tau. This proposal will investigate the
mechanisms and consequences of cGAS and nucleic acid sensing pathways in tauopathy. I aim to dissect the
molecular mechanism of cGAS activation in response to tau by focusing on tau dependent cellular processes
that induce mitochondrial stress and microglial senescence (Aim 1) and investigate how cGAS mediates
maladaptive microglial responses and neuronal damage in tauopathy (Aim 2). Finally, since antiviral responses
could be species-specific, there is strong rationale to extend mouse studies of innate nucleic acid sensing to
human models. Human and mouse cGAS share only 60% amino acid similarity and have different activation
requirements. I will establish human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based platforms to study broader nucleic acid
sensing pathways and perform unbiased CRISPR-screens to identify novel regulators of human nucleic acid
sensing in tau toxicity (Aim 3). The experiments outlined in this proposal will lead to a better understanding of
the role of nucleic acid sensors in tauopathy and AD which might prove translatable to humans."
10893467,"Project summary
The treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been transformed with the introduction of disease-modifying
therapies (DMTs), but these medications DMTs have known risks and are a significant financial burden for
many people with MS and for the healthcare system as a whole. Nationally, prescription drugs account for 10-
15% of total healthcare spending, but, for people with MS, prescription drugs account for more than two-thirds
of their total healthcare expenditures. The benefits of DMTs are clear early in the disease course, where they
have been shown to prevent relapses and the accumulation of lesions in the central nervous system. Later in
the disease course, the combination of immunosenscence and a shift from widespread neuroinflammation to
neurodegeneration results in diminished biological benefits of DMTs and a shift in the risk/benefit ratio in
people with MS. The most common risks associated with DMTs are infections, which have been reported to be
as high as 19.7 per 1000 person-years. Studies have also shown that infectious complications tend to increase
with both age and increased years of DMT exposure. For these biological, financial, and risk reasons
discontinuation of DMT in certain individuals should be considered. There is a growing body of observational
research supporting the notion that there is a safe time to discontinue DMTs with a low risk of recurrent
disease activity. These studies all suggest that older patients who have been on a DMT for several years
without active disease (no relapses, no new MRI lesions) have a low likelihood of recurrent disease activity
after discontinuing DMT. Despite the growing evidence to support DMT discontinuation there is a lack of
consensus from neurological societies and there is no standardized approach to this clinical decision. This
study seeks to develop and validation a machine learning based point of care decision support tool to
standardize the approach to MS DMT discontinuation. This study will develop the machine learning algorithm
in a large retrospective clinical cohort and externally validate the tool in the “Discontinuation of disease
modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis” (DISCOMS; NCT 03073603) randomized, controlled, single-blinded,
clinical trial dataset during the R21 phase. In the R33 phase the validated point of care tool will be
implemented through a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to assess the adoption and impact on clinical
outcomes over 24 months. The overarching goal of this proposal is to create a decision support tool that will
provide a standardized approach to DMT discontinuation resulting in a reduction in risk exposure and financial
burden to people with MS."
10912813,"is a major and rapidly increasing public health concern: over 30 million individuals
worldwide suffer from AD, which is projected to quadruple by 2050. AD has been reported to be the third leading
cause of death in the US. With this impending global public health crisis, treatments that prevent onset or slow
progression of AD are urgently needed but rarely available until the recent accelerated approval for aducenumab.
Therefore, it is of great interest to identify subpopulations which benefit most from a medication when the overall
treatment effect is minimum or not clinically meaningful. If such subpopulations can be identified, some of the
treatments from the negative trials can be proven to at least help a portion of the AD population. In this proposal
we will employ non-parametric interaction tree (IT)-based methods on mixed models for repeated measures
(MMRM) and regression-based methods to identify such subpopulations. IT for MMRM builds on the assessment
of the treatment-by-covariates interactions and can automatically seek subgroups of individuals in whom the
treatment shows heterogeneous effects. We also explore a new and more attractive fusion penalty approach for
final tree determination without any prior knowledge of grouping information. The regression-based methods aim
to identify subpopulations who will benefit from AD treatment based on their characteristics, which is very flexible
to make individualized treatment selection. Finally, we will develop and disseminate a user-friendly statistical
software package that will enable researchers to implement these methods with ease. Our extensions will better
capture individual heterogeneity in disease progression and facilitate evidence-based precision medicine in
future AD studies and other research areas."
10876984,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children in the United States. Several studies
demonstrate decreased mortality when severely injured children are transported to high-level (levels 1 and 2)
and designated pediatric trauma centers, compared with low-level (levels 3 or greater) and non-trauma
centers. Field trauma triage aims to identify patients who require high-level trauma center resources, with 95%
sensitivity and 65% specificity goals set by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma
(ACSCOT). The ACSCOT and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publish field triage
criteria, which are widely used by emergency medical service (EMS) agencies nationally. These criteria were
developed and updated through expert consensus primarily for adults, and have been shown to undertriage
severely injured children, with a reported sensitivity as low as 65%. In a 2020 systematic review, the Pediatric
Trauma Society Research Committee stated the data supporting field triage criteria are “minimal and of low
quality,” specifically calling for new research to establish individual criteria and combinations of criteria to
determine where an injured child should be transported. While the need for refined pediatric field triage criteria
is clear, progress has been limited by the lack of large-scale, linked prehospital and outcome data and
implementation failures including missing and inaccurate physiologic measurements (e.g. blood pressure and
mental status), and overreliance on provider judgement as the sole determinant of trauma center need. To
address these gaps and improve the prehospital triage of injured children, we will perform a descriptive
analysis of undertriage of children in 7 states using AHRQ Healthcare Cost and Utilization (HCUP) databases,
derive and validate refined pediatric field triage using predictive modeling of a robust population-based dataset
containing prehospital and outcome data from Los Angeles County, and conduct a mixed-methods study
evaluating implementation outcomes of the refined criteria in an urban EMS system. This proposal directly
addresses AHRQ priority populations including pediatric, minority, rural, and low-income, and is directly
responsive to AHRQ research priorities of improving health care patient safety by identifying potential harm
from and disparities in undertriage, designing and evaluating interventions to improve patient safety, and
harnessing data (including HCUP databases) to improve health care quality and patient outcomes. Successful
completion of this work will advance this field of study by describing the potential health impact of accurate field
triage, establishing preliminary implementation outcomes in preparation for a large, hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial to evaluate the refined criteria, and identifying key barriers to prehospital care of injured
children to inform future adaptations and implementation strategies. During this award, I will obtain the training,
mentorship, and experience in large-scale data analytics, predictive modeling, and D&I science necessary to
become an independent health services researcher focused on improving emergency care for children."
10900630,"Proposed Approach: We will use a mixed methods study design to identify the components of
emergency department (ED) pediatric readiness most predictive of short- and long-term survival among

novel analytics, and an interdisciplinary team to address this critical public health need.
Importance: Injury and acute illness are the leading causes of death in children. We have recently
shown that high ED pediatric readiness in US trauma centers and general hospitals is independently
associated with improved survival, but the components of ED readiness driving survival are unknown. It
is also unclear whether other organizational factors or ED processes of care improve survival among
children. Answers to these questions will guide EDs in prioritizing the implementation of ED readiness,
especially in smaller hospitals and rural settings with limited resources and budgets. This project is
designed to inform the national trauma center verification criteria, the national field triage guidelines, the
National Pediatric Readiness Project, and the Emergency Medical Services for Children program.

learning to identify the components of ED pediatric readiness predictive of short- and long-term survival.
Specific Aim 2. Empirically develop a global measure of ED pediatric readiness and compare it to the weighted
Pediatric Readiness Score for predicting short- and long-term survival in children.
Specific Aim 3: Use a positive deviance approach to identify ED pediatric readiness factors and processes of
care associated with improved survival among children receiving emergency care.
Study Design & Setting: We will build two cohorts of children using emergency services from 1/1/2018 to
12/31/2022 in 928 EDs in 11 states (ED cohort) and 678 trauma centers in 50 states (Trauma cohort). We will
link state vital statistics death records to the cohorts to track outcomes to one year and assess 152 unique
components of ED readiness using machine learning methods. We will also conduct 150 interviews in 30
hospitals across the US using positive deviance methods as a complement to the quantitative analyses.
Participants: Injured children 0–17 years using emergency services, including 15.6 million children with
ED visits, 606,810 hospitalized children, and 264,865 children admitted to US trauma centers.
Outcome measures: We will evaluate in-hospital mortality (primary) and 1-year mortality (secondary)
at the patient-level. We will also evaluate the observed versus expected mortality at the ED-level to
facilitate the positive deviance analysis."
10925363,"Project Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the most prevalent, debilitating neuro-degenerative
diseases of aging, and current treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (e.g., agitation, aggression,
and depression) of ADRD are mixed. While non-pharmacological behavioral interventions are recommended
as first-line treatments for these NPS of ADRD, they require substantial time and resources, and may be less
effective for severely agitated, aggressive, or depressed older patients with ADRD.
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and safe treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders,
including treatment-resistant depression, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. Case series and
naturalistic studies support preliminary evidence for the efficacy of ECT to treat severe agitation, aggression,
depression, or other NPS in ADRD. To date, associations of ECT with long-term improvement in NPS and
geriatric syndromes (e.g., functional declines and frailty), as well as with hospital and nursing home admission
rates and all-cause mortality rates are largely unexplored. The proposed nationwide cohort study explicitly
addresses these knowledge gaps.
 Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ 2016-2019 Medicare claims data (Parts A, B, and
D) linked with multiple data sources (e.g., Home Health Outcome and Assessment Information Set, Medicare
Current Beneficiary Survey, and National Death Index), this proposed study features the following specific
aims: 1) to examine incidence and prevalence rates of ECT use and socio-demographic and clinical factors
associated with ECT use; 2) to investigate longitudinal associations of ECT with NPS and geriatric syndromes;
and 3) to examine differential risks of hospital or nursing home admission rates and all-cause mortality rates by
ECT use in older adults with ADRD. Longitudinal data analyses, such as generalized linear mixed modeling
and competing-risk regression methods, will be used for Aims 2 and 3. In this nationwide cohort study, we will
employ propensity-score matching and instrumental variable techniques to adjust for both observed and
unobserved confounders. Intent-to-treat and as-treated analyses will also be conducted. Earlier studies support
that ECT is associated with improvement in NPS of ADRD and our analyses show that ECT use with presence
of both depression and ADRD was associated with a lower likelihood of all-cause mortality rates; we thus
hypothesize that ECT may also be protective against geriatric syndromes.
 This is the first nationwide, longitudinal cohort study investigating the long-term effectiveness and safety of
ECT in adults with ADRD. The proposed study is innovative since it will provide a better understanding of ECT
use and its association with NPS, geriatric syndromes, and other health outcomes. Findings from this study will
inform clinical guidance on ECT use in older adults with ADRD."
10931590,"Cancer cells exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in cell signaling, metabolism, and other functional
states. Changing environmental conditions impose additional stresses on cancer cells, further
increasing tumor heterogeneity as subsets of cells reprogram key functions to survive,

cells emerge dynamically over the course of tumor progression and treatment, underscoring the
critical need to analyze cancer cells over space and time. As an expert in molecular imaging,
cancer model systems, and cancer biology, I develop approaches to quantify key processes in
cancer biology, including signaling, metabolism, and pharmacodynamics of therapy, in complex
living systems from cell-based assays to animal models. My expertise in fluorescence and

of in vivo bioluminescence imaging of biochemical events, having invented firefly luciferase
complementation. I remain at the forefront of developing new bioluminescence methods for
discovery in cancer. I have a strong record of engineering new reporters and implementing
methods to extend capabilities of in vivo multiphoton microscopy, both with multiplexed
fluorescence imaging reporters and fluorescence lifetime imaging. To capture tumor
heterogeneity from imaging data, I write custom image processing code to automatically segment
and quantify multiple imaging reporter signals from thousands of cells. My effort is fully funded by
3 NCI research programs. 1) Integrators of Metastatic Potential: Discover how GIV, a signaling

on understanding and overcoming tumor heterogeneity to advance precision medicine in cancer."
10914274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular senescence is a stable form of cell cycle arrest program associated with pro-inflammatory responses.
Senescent cells accumulate in diseased and aged tissues, where they impair tissue renewal and promote
inflammation. Clearance of senescent cells using genetic or pharmacological tools ameliorates disease severity
and promotes healthy aging. Therefore, understanding the biology of senescence is an important biomedical
objective.
The inflammatory program of senescence is a major contributor to the detrimental roles of senescence in aging
and disease. Senescent cells secrete a large array of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and
growth factors, collectively termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP program
recruits immune cells, modulates tissue microenvironment, and ultimately causes inflammation that contributes
to most, if not all, age-associated pathologies. Hence, understanding and targeting the SASP program is a major
direction in senescence and aging research.
Our group contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of the SASP by showing that the cytosolic DNA
sensing cGAS-STING pathway is involved. In senescent cells and aged mouse tissues, chromatin fragments
undergo nucleus-to-cytoplasm trafficking, via nuclear membrane blebs that bud off the nuclei, forming
cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCF). CCF activates cGAS and the SASP program. These results have been
independently reproduced by other groups and collectively the CCF-cGAS-STING pathway is considered as one
of the central mechanisms that contribute to the SASP program.
CCF, by microscopy measurements, is a large entity with an average size of 2 um, which is significantly larger
than the capacity of the nuclear pore complex with an upper limit of approximately 100 nm. A key unaddressed
question is the mechanism that shuttles the CCF from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This study investigates a
central hypothesis that CCF is shuttled to the cytoplasm via a membrane-trafficking mechanism that
resembles viral nuclear egress. First, we propose to investigate the proteins at the inner and outer nuclear
membrane that mediate the nuclear egress of CCF and the consequence of the SASP program using senescent
cells in vitro. Second, we aim to evaluate the importance of nuclear egress complexes in mediating CCF and the
SASP in mouse models of senescence. Third, because aging and inflammation are closely connected with
nutrient metabolism, we will further investigate the impact of metabolic alterations on nuclear egress of CCF,
focusing on the stability of proteins involved in nuclear egress.
This study will provide novel mechanistic insights into the formation of CCF, a key event that triggers the SASP
program. This knowledge may facilitate the development of new therapies that target the cytosolic DNA sensing
pathway to intervene in aging and age-associated diseases."
10900821,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autologous CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) have resulted in extraordinary response
rates in relapsing and refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). However, over 60% of CD19-CAR-T recipients
will experience disease recurrence or progression. Most of these patients will die from their disease.
Mechanisms of CAR-T treatment failure are partially understood and biomarkers informing patient outcomes
and management have limited clinical utility. Our central hypothesis is that orthogonal modalities (e.g., clinical,
molecular, genomic, and radiomic [quantitative measures from medical images]) complement one another,
together providing information on resistance mechanisms and patient outcomes beyond that accessible
through any individual modality. We present results suggesting that machine learning is an effective
methodology for synthesizing and modeling multiple sources of data together. Cancer cells harness genomic
heterogeneity to evade pressure applied by immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our
preliminary data also demonstrate that TP53 genomic alterations strongly determine response to CAR-T.
Furthermore, using transcriptomic profiling, we found that cancer cellular pathways required for effective
transmission of CAR-T cytotoxic signals are distorted in TP53-altered lymphoma. These early findings provide
a proof-of-concept for the utility of genomics to inform disease biology and risk after CAR-T.
We hypothesize that tumor genetic aberrations in cellular pathways used by CAR-T cells to exert cytotoxicity
drive treatment resistance by rendering cancer cells insensitive to CAR-T stimuli and supporting immune
escape. In Aim 1, we will use comprehensive genotypic and phenotypic tumor profiling before and after CAR-T
to study the role of a priori determined genes and pathways in mediating inherent and acquired treatment
resistance. We also hypothesize that orthogonal modalities for patient and tumor profiling are complementary,
and their integration into a unified, multimodal model could accurately predict CAR-T outcomes. In Aim 2, we
will synthesize data from multiple modalities and use machine learning algorithms to predict CAR-T response
and identify novel biomarkers.
To meet our goals, we have compiled one of the largest CAR-T patient and sample biobanks. A group of
leading experts in immunology, genetics, pathology, radiology, machine learning, and bioinformatics will guide
the candidate in this multidisciplinary work. If successful, we expect our combinatorial approach to uncover
genetic features underlying inherent and acquired CAR-T resistance and identify new druggable targets.
Furthermore, our machine learning approach will support treatment personalization by establishing decision
support systems and identifying biomarkers of high-risk patients. Finally, we will introduce novel methodologies
for modeling CAR-T outcomes, which are extendable to other forms of treatment."
10878917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Social isolation is a potent form of psychosocial stress, and a growing public health concern. Older adults,
particularly those individuals isolated during the COVID-19 pandemic, are particularly vulnerable. One in four
individuals over the age of 65 are estimated to be affected by social isolation and loneliness, which are
associated with an increase in mortality risk by up to 70%. Previous studies have shown other forms of
psychosocial stress and mental illness are associated with increased risk for osteoporosis and related
fractures, which are likewise associated with increased mortality in older adults. Despite the increase in social
isolation and the overlap between at-risk populations, there has been little research on the effects of social
isolation on bone loss and skeletal metabolism. The limited work that has been done in rodents suggest that
social isolation negatively impacts bone health, leading to decreased bone mineral density. None of these
studies, however, have explored the mechanisms of isolation-induced bone loss, or examined differences in
the effect of isolation on bone between the sexes. My own preliminary studies show that males exposed to
social isolation had reduced femoral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and cortical thickness.
Females, conversely, did not have any reduction in bone mass. My data also showed changes to
glucocorticoid receptor and β2 adrenergic receptor expression as a result of social isolation, which both have
known effects on bone. The goal of this project is therefore to test the overarching hypothesis that social
isolation leads to bone loss through altered glucocorticoid (Aim 1) and sympathetic nervous system (Aim 2)
activity. I will test these hypotheses using a 4 to 8-week-long mouse model of social isolation in 16-week old
mice, in combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches. I will also use proteomic and microRNA
sequencing approaches to identify novel systemic changes in response to social isolation that may impact
bone. The proposed project will be the first study to identify mediating mechanisms of social isolation-induced
bone loss and precisely test the effects of isolation on bone metabolism through a range of imaging, genetic,
histologic, and omic approaches. The results of this project will inform future clinical and epidemiological
studies, and help identify prevention strategies and treatments for individuals at the greatest risk for social
isolation."
11009494,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, millions of pregnancies in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa
have been impacted by SARS-CoV-2 infection. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 and malaria co-infections during
pregnancy will continue as new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and cause re-infections in subsequent waves.
SARS-CoV-2 and malaria in pregnancy are both associated with adverse birth and infant outcomes – including
preterm birth, low birth weight, and impaired growth and neurodevelopment – possibly mediated through
maternal inflammation. Data on long-term developmental effects of gestational SARS-CoV-2 in highly malaria
exposed populations are lacking. To address this gap, I will leverage samples and data from mother-infant dyads
enrolled in two complementary ongoing NIH-funded antimalarial chemoprevention trials in Busia, Uganda. In the
pregnancy trial, pregnant women are randomized to one of three antimalarial chemoprevention regimens and
followed through delivery; infants born to these women are being randomized in a separate clinical trial to receive
antimalarial chemoprevention or placebo and followed to age 4 years. These trials have coincided with Uganda’s
early SARS-CoV-2 surges, and preliminary data indicate high incidence of both SARS-CoV-2 and malaria during
pregnancy. Using clinical data and samples collected as part of the ongoing trials, I will test the hypothesis that
infants exposed to gestational SARS-CoV-2 will have impaired growth and neurodevelopment in early childhood
when compared with unexposed infants, and that this is mediated by maternal inflammation. I further hypothesize
that exposure to both SARS-CoV-2 and malaria in pregnancy increases adverse infant outcomes due to the
synergistic inflammatory effects of both pathogens. In Aim 1, I will use serologic testing of stored plasma samples
to retrospectively identify mothers who experienced SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy and compare the growth of
infants with and without gestational SARS-CoV-2 exposure through age 4 years. In Aim 2, I will compare
neurocognitive test scores at ages 24 and 42 months among infants with and without gestational SARS-CoV-2.
In Aim 3, I will explore maternal proteomic immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and determine if
the effect of gestational SARS-CoV-2 on infant growth and neurodevelopment is mediated by specific
inflammatory pathways. This cohort is uniquely poised to address the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy in a
malaria endemic setting, with longitudinal data and samples collected before widespread baseline SARS-CoV-
2 immunity. To accomplish these aims and become an independent translational researcher in tropical perinatal
infections, I have assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team of experts in in infectious diseases, obstetrics,
pediatrics, neuropsychology, immunology, and global health. Results from this proposed study have immediate
implications for improving care of at-risk infants, and could identify diagnostic or therapeutic targets for future
clinical interventions."

 Human oncogenic viruses are a major cause of cancer, with recent estimates that 15% of all cancers are
associated with a viral infection. One such oncovirus is Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which
primarily affects untreated AIDS patients and other immunocompromised individuals. Like most viruses, KSHV
relies both on host and unique viral processes for infection, each representing potential therapeutic
vulnerabilities. One of these is an unusual link between the expression of an essential class of viral “late” genes
and the replication of the viral dsDNA genome (vDNA). Though long recognized, the mechanism driving this link
remains unknown. Here, I will use a multi-pronged functional genomics approach to identify and test new models
for this process.
 The dependency of viral late gene transcription on vDNA replication depends on both the trans and cis
viral components supporting vDNA replication. The trans component consists of the virally encoded vDNA
replication factors. In Aim 1, I will use a method I have previously developed in my postdoc for high-throughput
mutagenesis and phenotyping of viral mutants to identify mutations in these viral components that prevent late
gene expression but still support vDNA replication. Preliminary work has already demonstrated that such
mutations exist, and by expanding on this we can identify the role these viral proteins play in enabling late gene
expression. In Aim 2, I will examine the viral origin of lytic replication, which is required in cis for both vDNA
replication and late gene expression. While previous studies have been limited technically, new use of dCas9
will allow me to directly perturb the functional elements of this regulatory sequence and identify the distinct
molecular events required to support vDNA replication and/or late gene expression.
 In my final aim, I will extend my work beyond the virus to identify and characterize the host components
of this process. I propose to use genetic interactions to identify the host factors hijacked to support the viral life
cycle. Specifically, by leveraging the mutants and functional elements discovered in my previous aims, I can
further identify how the host supports or antagonizes this process both at the cis and trans levels. Each of these
proposed aims will reveal new knowledge about vDNA replication and late gene expression, allow us to test
models for how these processes are linked, and finally represent powerful functional genomic approaches that
can be applied to many problems in KSHV and related dsDNA viruses."

This proposal details a five-year training plan for the development of a research program focused on
elucidating the therapeutic potential of superimposed additional Wnt signaling on colonic neoplasia.
The molecular driver shared across the vast majority of colonic neoplasms is constitutive Wnt
signaling, most commonly caused by loss of function mutations in the APC gene. The loss of function
of APC permits beta catenin to constitutively translocate to the nucleus and induce the formation of
colonic adenomas which can further mutate into colon cancer. To date, strategies to inhibit Wnt
signaling for therapeutic purposes have failed. However, other elements of the beta catenin
destruction complex that work with APC, such as GSK3 alpha and beta can be pharmacologically
inhibited. Therefore, instead of inhibiting Wnt signaling, and informed by the concept that a “just right”
amount of Wnt signaling may be selected for in tumor cells, we hypothesized additional Wnt signaling
would be deleterious to tumor cells but would simultaneously enhance the function of normal cells.
This project will elucidate fundamental dependencies of Wnt signaling in normal tissues as well as
tumors. Ultimately, I believe this will engender a specific therapy for adenomas, to which there is no
existing medical therapy other than polypectomy, and additionally provide a broadly applicable and
potentially safe approach to treat colorectal cancer.
I am clinically trained pathologist and physician scientist seeking K08 support for mentored research.
This work will be mentored by Prof. Omer Yilmaz and Prof. Robert Langer. Prof. Yilmaz is a
pathologist and physician-scientist, and studies the effects of diet on intestinal stem cells and state-
of-the-art intestinal organoid models. Prof. Langer has fundamentally transformed and defined
biomedical engineering, is the most cited engineer in history, and most recently his expertise in
nanoparticle delivery provided the foundation for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The work will be
conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Massachusetts General Hospital, both
world class institutions of the highest caliber. I have assembled a scientific advisory committee
consisting of world class cancer biologists to help guide my scientific progress, consisting of Prof.
Tyler Jacks, Prof. Michael Yaffe, and Prof. William Kaelin. This K08 mentored research award will
ensure I have the time and resources to develop expertise in cancer biology and explore this
promising therapeutic and biologically intriguing concept of increased Wnt signaling to specifically
treat colonic neoplasia. This topic will provide ample substrate for me to grow as an independent
physician scientist."

In response to large numbers of senior center clients who suffer untreated depression and the dearth of
geriatric mental health providers, we have partnered with senior center stakeholders to simplify Behavioral
Activation (BA) to match the skill set of lay volunteers (“Do More, Feel Better”; DMFB).
The lay delivery model: 1. makes use of existing volunteer resources that can address the insufficient
workforce; and 2. has potential for being an acceptable and sustainable delivery model. However, the capacity
of this model to engage the same target (increased activity) and to yield comparable clinical outcomes as
professionally-delivered interventions is yet to be determined in a fully-powered trial.
This Collaborative R01 proposes fully powered randomized effectiveness trial testing the effect of DMFB in
comparison to professionally-delivered BA (MSW BA) on increased activity level (target) and decreased
depressive symptoms.
The specific aims are to: 1. Test the effectiveness of DMFB, in comparison to MSW BA, for depressed (PHQ-
9>10 and Ham-D>14) older adults (>60) on increasing overall activity level (target) and reducing depression
symptoms; and 2. test whether increased activity level predicts greater reduction in depression severity and
whether increased activity's impact on depression is non-inferior across conditions.
Client participants will be a total of 288 older (>60 years) non-psychotic, non-demented individuals with elevated
depressive symptoms from 6 Seattle, 6 New York City, and 6 Tampa area senior centers serving economically
and ethnically diverse communities. Eligible clients will be randomized within senior center to either DMFB
(n=144) or MSW BA (n=144). Two lay volunteers and 2 MSWs per center will provide the intervention.
Our proposal responds to the 2012 IOM report which highlighted the dearth of mental health providers for older
adults and the need to develop a workforce of nontraditional providers. DMFB is a streamlined BA intervention
that has high potential for sustainability by making use of an untapped volunteer resource and supervision
infrastructure within senior centers. Our findings will identify effective interventions for an underserved and
difficult to engage population, our partners in aging services would be pleased to implement either delivery
format of BA to activate depressed older adults."

Antiviral cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are critical for controlling viremia and are central to HIV
cure/remission strategies. However, there is a fundamental gap in understanding the molecular determinants
underlying the onset and persistence of HIV-specific CTL dysfunction in individuals who fail to control viremia,
preventing strategies to restore CTL function for HIV prevention and durable remission. The objective of this
application is to define molecular regulation and biomarkers of HIV-specific CTL dysfunction. Based upon strong
preliminary evidence, we hypothesize that initiation of CTL dysfunction preceding loss of virologic control and
maintenance of CTL dysfunction during antiretroviral therapy are mediated by cell-intrinsic mechanisms,
identification of which will inform therapeutic interventions to combat HIV persistence. We will define regulatory
mechanisms of CTL dysfunction using an integrative, multi-omics systems biology approach at intra-patient,
antigen-specific, and single-cell resolution, and validate using gene editing for restoration of antiviral CTL
function. The rationale of the proposed studies is that a more precise understanding of the molecular
mechanisms governing durable versus failed CTL-mediated HIV control will be needed to advance CTL-based
HIV cure strategies. Aim 1 will define mechanisms by which CTL dysfunction is initiated preceding breakthrough
viremia in HIV controllers. Preliminary data demonstrate that a progressive loss of antiviral CTL function
precedes viral rebound in patients who lose HIV control. Experiments in this aim will elucidate regulatory
pathways governing the initiation of CTL dysfunction by evaluating changes in epigenetic, transcriptional, and
post-transcriptional signatures using longitudinal specimens preceding loss of HIV control. Regulatory pathways
will be disrupted using gene editing for mechanistic validation. Aim 2 will define mechanisms by which CTL
dysfunction is maintained during pharmacologic HIV suppression and the extent to which function can be
restored. Preliminary evidence indicates that CTL dysfunction is not restored by antiretroviral therapy or immune
checkpoint blockade. Experiments in this aim will identify molecular mechanisms by which dysfunction is
maintained in non-escaped HIV-specific CTLs during antiretroviral therapy using a multi-omics approach, and
determine the extent to which CTL function can be restored by inhibition and gene editing of identified regulatory
networks. This approach is innovative because it couples controlled intra-patient comparisons of epitope-specific
CTLs by population and single-cell transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic profiling with gene editing
in primary cells to interrogate the molecular mechanisms that underlie HIV-specific CTL dysfunction. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide the mechanistic groundwork for development and
evaluation of interventions that aim to harness CTLs for eradication or functional cure of HIV infection."

This competitive renewal application focuses on advancing the field of intracranial flow diversion (FDs), that
currently constitutes approximately one-third of the treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms. There
remain key gaps in the knowledge that hinder expansion of the clinical application of these transformational
devices, which to date are limited in scope to unruptured, proximal aneurysms along the internal carotid artery.
We envision that, with our proposed discovery system, we will facilitate application of novel, next-generation
devices in ruptured aneurysms and in aneurysms distal to the Circle of Willis, and will allow customization of
approaches to minimize thromboembolic risk in individual patients. We will break down these barriers to
expanded utility by 1) understanding of key aspects of aneurysm occlusion, such as the role of acute and
appropriate fibrin deposition across the aneurysm neck, 2) unraveling the mechanisms underlying side branch
occlusion (i.e. the impact of hemodynamic, or neointimal growth and endothelizalization across the side branch
ostia, or both), and 3) identifying the potential risk factors that cause elevated risk of thromboembolic
complications, such as hemodynamical variable, device malapposition, platelet function, and untoward fibrin
deposition beyond the neck of the aneurysm, among others. We propose to employ innovative approaches in
in vivo intravascular fibrin molecular imaging, computational fluid dynamics modeling, and improved animal
modeling, and finally biomarker discovery in clinical studies. These approaches can improve the outcome of
not only FD, but other devices in treating aneurysms by better understanding of the mechanisms of both
aneurysm healing and complications. Our robust and reproducible methods of statistical evaluations will
directly assess 1) the role of fibrin deposition rapidity in the device at the neck of the aneurysm aids robust
aneurysm, 2) the suitability and validity of the superior mesenteric artery branches to simulate the patency of
the small perforating vessels covered by FDs, and 3) correlate biological and imaging data with delayed
ischemic events following FD therapy.The discoveries from this hypothesis-driven, multidisciplinary,
multimodality, clinical-translational research will provide a robust understanding of not only the mechanism of
action of FDs in aneurysm healing, but also the development of device-related complications. These
discoveries can provide guidance to clinicians using current technologies to optimize outcomes and minimize
complications, as well as investigators and engineers to develop improved devices. Ultimately, this information
will allow neurointerventionalists to make better informed decisions on device choice, leading to improved
patient care."

Synaptic structure and function are the keys to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Specifically, dysfunctional synapses and dysregulated synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus
are responsible for early memory and cognitive decline in AD. Invasive tools, such as electrophysiological or
immunohistochemical techniques, have been for decades to study synaptic morphology and density in animal
models or human postmortem brain samples. Nevertheless, it has been challenging to study synaptic
structure in living humans. The goals of the proposed research are: (1) to characterize the ability of in vivo
diffusion MRI techniques to detect alterations of axodendritic synapse density in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s
disease and (2) to assess the translational utility of such diffusion metrics for future in vivo human brain
studies.
A recent milestone in radiopharmaceutical development enables the possibility of studying synaptic vesicle
glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) in vivo via PET imaging. PET imaging with the 11C-UCB-J tracer has shown a
reduction of SV2A binding in mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. Despite its molecular accuracy, PET
imaging suffers from disadvantages including high cost, low spatial resolution, and ionizing radiation exposure.
On the other hand, MRI is a safe, non-invasive, and non-irradiating imaging technique that provides at least a
5-fold better spatial resolution. The modern advancement in diffusion MRI provides metrics that reflect neurite
density (i.e., axons and dendrites) via compartment modeling of intracellular volume fraction. Using in vivo
diffusion compartment-modeling imaging on the human brain, our laboratory demonstrated a significant
decrease in intra-neurite volume fraction in white-matter areas consequent to mild traumatic brain injury,
normal aging, and mild cognitive decline. We have also demonstrated decreased intra-neurite volume fraction
in the human hippocampal subfields associated with poor performance in cognitive and verbal learning
assessments across the clinical AD continuum.
Cumulatively, our and others’ results in human studies suggest these advanced diffusion metrics are sensitive
to brain degenerations and associated with cognitive and memory declines, which are thought to be caused by
dysfunctional and dysregulated synapses. Nevertheless, there has not been direct evidence nor detailed
characterization connecting these advanced diffusion metrics and synaptic density. The proposed research
aims to address this knowledge gap."
10906100,"Tachycardia, or abnormally fast heart rate, is an important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Prolonged tachycardia is known to induce cardiomyopathy in patients who have no prior structural heart diseases.
Moreover, transient tachycardia, frequently observed in heart failure patients, can exacerbate the cardiovascular
outcome. However, very little is known about the molecular drivers underlying tachycardia-induced cardiac
dysfunction. This gap in our knowledge hinders the development of more effective heart failure treatment,
especially for patients with hard-to-control tachycardia. This K99/R00 proposal will leverage recent advances in
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), tissue engineering, and multiomics technologies to uncover the molecular
signaling pathways critically involved in the pathology of tachycardia-related heart disease. The applicant, Dr.
Chengyi Tu, has established and validated an in vitro tachycardia platform using engineered heart tissue (EHT).
In Aim 1, Dr. Tu will perform metabolomic and transcriptomic profiling of EHTs with or without tachypacing. To
validate the physiological relevance of the EHT model, canine samples from tachypacing-induced heart failure
will also be profiled. Preliminary data from the EHTs and the canine samples coherently indicate that the
disruption of glycolysis homeostasis may underly the impairment of cardiac function by tachycardia.
Metabolomics analysis shows that tachypacing in EHTs resulted in a selective accumulation of glycolysis
intermediates such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Interestingly,
promotion of fatty acid metabolism accelerated the recovery of cardiac contractility in tachypaced EHTs. Based
on these novel results, Aim 2 will focus on elucidating how different glycolysis intermediate metabolites affect
the function of cardiomyocytes, which has yet to be systematically examined. Lastly, Aim 3 (R00 phase) will
employ state-of-the-art mass spectrometry workflow to screen for novel binding targets of glycolysis
intermediates in cardiac cells, and examine the potential therapeutic benefits of manipulating these targets. This
K99/R00 proposal will be guided by an excellent mentoring team with diverse expertise, including mentor Dr.
Joseph Wu (iPSCs and cardiac biology), co-mentor Dr. Sanjiv Narayan (arrhythmia), advisors Dr. Michael
Snyder (genetics and multi-omics), Dr. Yuqin Dai (metabolomics), Dr. Stanley Qi (CRISPR interference) and Dr.
Beth Pruitt (bioengineering), as well as collaborators Dr. Fabio Recchia (canine model) and Dr. Donald Bers
(cardiac physiology). To sum up, the completion of the proposed study will significantly advance our mechanistic
understanding of how tachycardia adversely affects the heart, thereby creating new opportunities for therapeutic
interventions. The proposed training will significantly strengthen and expand Dr. Tu’s research expertise,
providing substantial momentum to his transition toward an independent cardiovascular researcher."
10878872,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The outcomes for patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) that are relapsed or refractory to frontline
therapy remain quite poor. While anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR19) T-cells have emerged as a
promising treatment option for this group of patients, over half of these patients still go on to exhibit disease
progression. The mechanisms through which resistance to CAR19 T-cell therapy develops, and factors
predictive of poor outcomes, have not yet been well characterized. In this proposal we seek to elucidate these
mechanisms with the ultimate goal of informing the design of improved immunotherapies that will result in better
outcomes for patients with LBCL.
 Novel methods to profile tumor-derived cell-free DNA from the blood plasma of patients, also referred to
as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), have unlocked significant opportunities to monitor treatment response and
study tumor biology both prior to and after therapy. We recently applied one such method called Cancer
Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing (CAPP-Seq), a targeted sequencing approach for ctDNA detection
and profiling, to a cohort of patients with LBCL undergoing therapy with the CAR19 platform axicabtagene
ciloleucel (axi-cel). We found that ctDNA levels prior to and following CAR19 T-cell infusion were predictive of
response, and also identified several genes involved in B-cell lineage commitment and determination of the
tumor immune microenvironment that were recurrently altered in patients who developed progressive disease.
 In this proposal we will build on this prior data by validating our findings in an independent cohort of
patients undergoing therapy with an alternate CAR19 platform (Aim 1). We will then assess the downstream
effects these alterations have on tumor phenotype and the tumor microenvironment. By integrating gene
expression data and cutting-edge immunophenotyping and computational tools, we will resolve the components
of the intratumoral immune milieu to gain a better understanding of how different immune cell populations
contribute to response and resistance (Aim 2). Finally, we will employ a novel organoid tissue culture system to
directly assess how alterations in these genes effect the interaction between CAR19 T-cells and tumor cells in
the context of an intact immune microenvironment (Aim 3). Ultimately, we hope that these studies will have
implications not only in development of improved CAR19 platforms for lymphoma, but also in the improvement
of immunotherapies for other cancer types as well.
 This proposal will be carried out at the Stanford University School of Medicine, under the mentorship of
Ash Alizadeh, MD/PhD. Through completion of this proposal, I will gain the relevant experience in bioinformatics
and tumor immunology to successfully launch a career as an independent investigator focused on developing
and translating new immunotherapies for patients with lymphoma."
10901989,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Anthracycline antibiotics are essential, lifesaving chemotherapies used in ~60% of pediatric cancer
patients, but they confer a substantial dose-dependent risk of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in long-term
survivors. The standard heart failure management approach -- waiting for left ventricular ejection fraction decline
and then starting afterload reduction therapy -- has been used for decades despite its limited success.
Alternatively, an early, targeted treatment strategy guided by specific disease manifestations could improve
outcomes. Adverse left ventricular remodeling (i.e., change in size and shape) precedes and may precipitate
heart failure and could be used to guide such a strategy. However, there is a critical need to define the specific
adverse features of left ventricular shape and to determine the relationship between remodeling and both
modifiable risk factors and long-term dysfunction in childhood cancer survivors treated with anthracyclines.
 The overall objectives of this proposal are to define the anthracycline-related adverse features of left
ventricular shape in childhood cancer survivors and to determine the associations between remodeling and both
modifiable risk factors, including reduced physical activity, and dysfunction over time. The central hypothesis of
this project is that anthracyclines cause specific adverse changes in 3D left ventricular shape; moderate to
vigorous physical activity mitigates this remodeling process; and adverse remodeling is prognostic
of subsequent dysfunction. To achieve these objectives, we will comprehensively analyze cardiac magnetic
resonance imaging in cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts of adolescent and young adult childhood cancer
survivors. The Specific Aims are to 1) define the adverse features of left ventricular shape associated with
anthracycline dose exposure; 2) determine the associations between left ventricular remodeling and modifiable
risk factors, and 3) determine the relationship between left ventricular remodeling and subsequent dysfunction.
The expected contributions of this research will yield new imaging-based disease markers; improve early
detection, risk assessment, and clinical prognostication; and inform a future targeted intervention.
 Dr. Hari K. Narayan seeks this career development award to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an
independent physician scientist focused on preventing anthracycline-related heart failure in childhood cancer
survivors. Through the proposed training, he seeks to expand beyond his cardiovascular imaging and
epidemiology background by developing skills in computational modeling and machine learning analysis, patient-
oriented and physical activity research, and academic leadership. The mentorship team, which includes
expertise in pediatric clinical trials, computational cardiac image analysis, physical activity in survivorship, and
pediatric survivorship oncology, is optimally suited to guide him through training completion and his transition to
independence. Dr. Narayan’s goal is to build upon the proposed training and research through the development
of an early, targeted intervention to prevent anthracycline-related heart failure in childhood cancer survivors."
10886797,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a major health concern that affects up to 10% of all reproductive-aged
women and is the leading cause of female infertility. This complex, heterogeneous condition is associated with
ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and cardiometabolic dysfunction and incurs an estimated $8 billion
in annual U.S. healthcare costs. PCOS is associated with alterations in both ovarian factors (folliculogenesis,
gonadotropin secretion and action, ovarian androgen biosynthesis) and non-ovarian factors (insulin secretion
and action, weight and energy regulation). These contributing factors are all interconnected, and the inciting
causes of PCOS remains unknown. As a result, the clinical care of PCOS is currently confined to managing the
manifestations of PCOS rather than treating the underlying causes. The overall hypothesis for this study is that
PCOS arises from the perturbation of multiple metabolic and reproductive endocrine pathways, some of which
are shared and others distinct between women, men, and children. To test this hypothesis, this project will take
advantage of a recently completed genome wide-association study meta-analysis that has doubled the number
of genetic loci that influence PCOS risk. Because these genetic variants are present in all individuals, this
discovery enables examination of the phenotypic effects of genetic risk factors for PCOS in not just women but
also men and children. This project leverages the power of the UK Biobank, a cohort of nearly 400,000 adults
in the UK, and four pediatric cohorts, Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N>6,000),
Copenhagen Studies on Asthma in Childhood (N>500), Project Viva (N>500), and the HOLBAEK Study
(N>4,000). In adults, genetic risk factors for PCOS will be assessed for sex-biased effects on cardiometabolic
and other outcomes and clustered with PCOS-related traits, and gene-set enrichment analysis will be used to
gain mechanistic insights into these groups of PCOS genetic risk factors. In children, genetic risk scores (i.e.,
estimated genetic susceptibility to PCOS) will be calculated and tested for associations with cardiometabolic
and androgenic traits as well as diverse metabolites. This proposal promises to implicate causal biological
mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of PCOS and its associated features, which could allow for the
deconstruction of the causes of PCOS into distinct subgroups, and thereby pave the way for a precision-
medicine approach to the diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of PCOS in women and its associated
conditions in adults and children. Through this proposal, Dr. Zhu will attain new skills in advanced
computational genetic methods, experience in applying principles in computational biology and bioinformatics,
and a deep understanding of the impact of reproductive endocrinology on a variety of health conditions. The
K08 award will provide Dr. Zhu the critical training and mentorship to achieve her goal of becoming an
independent physician-scientist applying innovative computational methods to understand complex
reproductive endocrine disorders."

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a severe type of hemorrhagic stroke with overall mortality
rate of 51% and long-term morbidity among more than a third of survivors [1-3, 26, 27]. Large artery
vasospasm has been the focus of SAH research for past 50 years but preventing vasospasm has not always
translated into improved patient outcomes. The cerebral venous circulation is critical since 70% of the
cerebral blood volume, which constitutes approximately 6% of brain volume under normal conditions, is located
in venous vascular bed [15]. Variations in cerebral venous drainage pattern, venous obstruction, stenosis of
internal jugular veins, and venous sinus morphological anomalies are frequently encountered which can have
direct implications for SAH outcomes. A cerebral angiography series study showed over 50% of those
aneurysm cases had both asymmetric dural sinuses and SAH [10]. Furthermore, patients with cerebral venous
thrombosis can present as SAH [22, 23]. However, the role of cerebral venous circulation in SAH
pathophysiology has not been explored. This proposal will elucidate the role of cerebral venous impariment in
SAH pathology using a new mouse model of SAH with ipsilateral jugular vein occlusion.
We hypothesize that impaired cerebral venous drainage will lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow
obstruction, increase cerebral venous sinus pressure, and promote CSF hypersecretion which will cause an
acute and fatal elevation in intracranial pressure (ICP) following SAH. We will develop and characterize a new
mouse model of SAH with ipsilateral jugular venous outflow obstruction and determine the outcomes after
SAH. Next, we will elucidate potential mechanisms how ipsilateral venous obstruction increases ICP after SAH
and explore potential strategies to manage increased ICP after SAH with ipsilateral jugular venous occlusion in
the new mouse model. Overall, this proposal will provide a new perspective on the role of cerebral venous
system in SAH pathophysiology which can potentially discover new therapeutic strategies for SAH patients."

Many of the sounds that animals hear are created by their own actions and being able to correctly differentiate
these sounds is critical to a range of behaviors. An influential idea is that the brain uses sensory-motor predictions
to anticipate sounds generated by movement, and identifying the circuit mechanisms that learn and implement
these predictions is critical to our understanding of cortical function in health and disease. Since predictive
computations involve the interaction of sensory and non-sensory signals, identifying underlying circuit
mechanisms will require understanding how distributed but interconnected brain regions work together. While
the thalamus is often perceived as a simple conduit of sensory information, the second-order thalamus is tightly
linked with both the sensory and motor cortex, positioning it to play a key role in integrating sensory and non-
sensory information. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the auditory second-order thalamus shapes
predictive processing throughout the auditory cortex. First, I will use a transgenic mouse line that specifically
labels second-order thalamic neurons to map the precise functional connections of the second-order auditory
thalamus (Aim 1, K99). Next, I will develop an acoustic augmented reality home cage environment where mice
can rapidly learn multiple predictive behaviors. I will perform wireless recordings while freely moving mice make
multiple sound-generating movements to determine the sensory, movement, and prediction information encoded
in the second-order auditory thalamus (Aim 2, K99). Finally, I will perform simultaneous multi-area recordings
and targeted neural interventions in the thalamus and cortex of behaving mice to determine how predictive
computations are carried out across the thalamocortical circuit (Aim 3, R00). With the guidance of my mentorship
team, I have developed a training plan at New York University that will provide me the technological skills needed
to complete these aims and make important discoveries about how distributed circuits integrate sensory and
non-sensory information during predictive processing. The proposed training plan will also provide me with the
conceptual framework and professional skills to achieve my long-term career goal: to investigate how distributed
circuits work together mechanistically to enable context-dependent auditory processing in health and disease as
an independent scientist."
10894323,"Dr. James J. Prisciandaro is a licensed Clinical Psychologist, Associate Professor in the Addiction Sciences
Division of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina
(MUSC), who is committed to making a measurable impact on our understanding and ability to treat individuals
with bipolar (BD) and/or substance use disorders (SUD) through his program of patient-oriented research (POR).
Dr. Prisciandaro has served as PI, Co-PI, or Co-I on 12 NIH-funded grant awards since joining MUSC in 2009,
but his success in designing and executing NIH-funded research studies has come at a significant cost: his
efforts to mentor new clinical investigators have been greatly limited by his employment within an academic
medical center that is not able to provide faculty with protected time for mentoring or professional development.
As a result of this lack of support, Dr. Prisciandaro has had to greatly limit the number of new clinical investigators
that he has been able to mentor, and he has not been able to expand his methodological skillset since completing
his K23 training 5-years ago. The proposed K24 award would allow Dr. Prisciandaro to fulfil his career goals by
providing him with the protected time and supplementary funding needed to comprehensively train significantly
more new clinical investigators and to develop and expand his methodological skills in MRI and statistics to
include genomics. Towards this end, Dr. Prisciandaro has recruited several consultants and collaborators to help
him create, execute, and monitor a comprehensive training plan, including longstanding collaborators within his
fields of expertise (Drs. Richard Edden [MRI] and Michaela Hoffman [biostatistics]) along with three new
consultants/collaborators, Drs. Ananda Amstadter (psychiatric genomics), Stefano Berto (genomics and
bioinformatics), and Zhewu Wang (psychiatric genetics). With their guidance, Dr. Prisciandaro has proposed a
research strategy to apply cutting-edge genomics methods to blood samples that he has collected from every
participant enrolled in each of his NIH-funded studies to date, starting with those from his K23 study; a 2*2
factorial (BD*alcohol use disorder [AUD]), multimodal-MRI investigation of neurochemical (i.e., GABA and
glutamate levels) and neurobehavioral overlap (i.e., activation to alcohol cues and response inhibition) between
BD and AUD. Dr. Prisciandaro will devote the remainder of his effort to his current NIH-funded program of POR,
focused on pharmacologically-manipulating intermediate MRI phenotypes of BD and/or SUD, which is tightly
aligned with his career goals and a rich source for mentee training and productivity. As these pharmaco-imaging
studies complete participant enrollment, Dr. Prisciandaro and his consultants/collaborators will apply to their data
the proposed genomics methods, extended to include genetic variants underlying the mechanisms of action of
the medications under investigation (e.g., gabapentin). He will involve mentees in all aspects of his POR,
including all proposed genomics research. Together, these combined efforts will significantly advance both Dr.
Prisciandaro's POR career as well as our understanding of and ability to treat individuals with BD+SUD."

There is a fundamental gap in the knowledge base about how chronic manganese exposures impacts develop-
ment of Alzheimer’s disease. The neurotoxic effects of manganese poisoning are known, as well as the motor
impairments that are its behavioral sequelae. However, chronic lower-level exposures have not been studied.
The neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease develops over decades prior to onset of severe cognitive and be-
havioral change (dementia) and thus its development is particularly susceptible to influence from environmental
factors. Manganese represents an environmental toxin with high likelihood of importance since exposure occurs
through multiple sources (contaminated water, food, inhalation from pollution and industrial complexes). Further,
exposure directly targets many of the primary mechanisms involved in Alzheimer’s disease pathology: β-amyloid
accumulation, oxidative stress and glial changes relating to neuroinflammation. Our central hypothesis is that
Chronic elevated manganese (Mn) exposure drives cognitive decline through impaired glutamate homeostasis.
Our long-term objectives are to isolate the direct link(s) between Mn and cognitive decline by demonstrating how
chronic Mn exposure affects altered glutamate clearance and other pathologies to a greater extent in mouse and
human stem cell models of AD than in controls. We will do this by: (1) Demonstrating the extent to which
chronic Mn exposure accelerates AD neuropathology. Following 3 months treatment with Mn to significantly
elevate brain Mn we will assess multiple markers of AD-related neuropathology, oxidative stress and neuroin-
flammation at the gene, protein and cellular level incorporating direct hypothesis testing and hypothesis gener-
ating approaches. Changes will be assessed prior to- and after onset of significant β-amyloid accumulation (6-
and 12 months of age), and in β-amyloid positive (APP/PSEN1, familial AD model) and negative mice
(APOE4/TREM2, sporadic AD model; and wild-type mice). (2) Demonstrating the extent to which chronic Mn
exposure impacts cognitive decline. We will assess learning and memory at the two age points using a com-
prehensive battery of behavioral tests for cognitive and motor changes. We will directly assess the potential for
Mn to impact the molecular basis of memory, synaptic strengthening through long term potentiation. Human
stem cell models will be utilized to validate these findings. (3) Establishing the role of brain Mn levels in
synaptic glutamate homeostasis. We will address the hypothesis that Mn directly impacts synaptic glutamate
homeostasis through primary cell culture and stem cell models and assess glutamate uptake and release. We
will functionally test the glutamatergic system by electrophysiological recordings. Finally we will utilize GLT-1
knockout mice to further probe the role of GLT-1 in particular in this relationship. Together these data will confirm
the role of chronic Mn exposure in AD neuropathology and cognitive decline, and specifically address its impact
on glutamatergic dyshomeostasis. Understanding these mechanisms will highlight an under-studied role for al-
tered Mn handling in Alzheimer’s disease, and provide a new target for disease prevention and interventions."

 Mosquito borne pathogens afflict millions of people worldwide and their prevalence is anticipated to
increase as mosquitoes and their pathogens become resistant to currently available drugs and insecticides.
While drugs can be used to treat some mosquito borne pathogens, a majority of transmission control comes
through targeting the mosquito vector itself. While insecticides targeting both adult and larval stages are
available, larvicides have the advantage of targeting a constrained target that is unable to readily evade
treatment. Unfortunately, only a few larvicides are available for use and their modes of action are limited.
Thus, there is a critical need for selective novel larvicides with additional modes of action. We have developed
two novel delivery systems that target the uniquely high pH levels of the larval gut. We hypothesize that
provisioning these compounds to immature mosquitoes will allow us to induce lethal effects in mosquitoes of
medical importance. Through a recursive set of aims whereby compounds are readily synthesized, tested and
evaluated we will test this hypothesis in two important mosquito vectors, the malaria vector Anopheles
stephensi and the arboviral vector Aedes aegypti. In Specific Aim 1 we assess the activity of pH responsive
compounds that are tuned to the unique larval midgut environments of Aedes aegypti and Anopheles
stephensi mosquitoes. An initial set of compounds developed by our lab in the MaMa and PTBD classes will be
provisioned to larvae and their efficacy will be assess through SDS-PAGE, imaging, and proteomic studies. In
Specific Aim 2 we will determine the ability of pH sensitive compounds to negatively impact larval
development and deliver larvicidal compounds specifically to the midgut of immature mosquitoes. Compounds
developed to perturb the larval gut will be evaluated for any deleterious effects that they have on the mosquito.
In depth studies of their metabolism, membrane integrity, and larval and adult fitness will be conducted. By the
end of this study, we will have assessed the activity of two chemically distinct sets of compounds in the midgut
of larval mosquitoes. The long-term goal is to develop flexible and highly mosquito-specific larvicidal
compounds with the capacity to leverage unique modes of action."

Persistent acute inflammation and chronic infection are hallmarks of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) pulmonary disease.
Bacterial infections cause much of the damage seen in CF patients’ airways. Chronic colonization by Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa (Pa) is strongly associated with disease progression and mortality due to the activation of
the host innate immune system. Innate immune cells drive this strong inflammation but paradoxically fail to
clear pathogens such as Pa. We have previously shown that Pa isolated from children with CF have unique
lipid A structures; one of the earliest adaptations to the CF airway. Lipid A is the membrane anchor of lipopoly-
saccharide (LPS) and is responsible for endotoxemia, localized tissue destruction, and septic shock. In addi-
tion to early adaptation to the CF airway, a highly pro-inflammatory, hyper-acylated lipid A structure is ob-
served in approximately one third of Pa isolated from patients with severe airway disease. The synthesis of
specific lipid A structures is essential to CF lung disease pathogenesis as products of inflammation, derived
from infiltrating host immune cells, such as neutrophils, are required for Pa to grow anaerobically in the thick
and poorly oxygenated mucus of the CF lung. The overall goals of this proposal will strengthen and extend our
hypothesis that during adaptation to the CF airway, Pa synthesizes CF-specific lipid A that alters host
innate immune mechanisms, leading to persistence and chronic infection of the CF airways and that
regulation of the neutrophil response could serve as a control mechanism for severe airway disease. The aims
in this proposal will first, determine pathogenicity and signaling potential of defined Pa lipid A structures in rele-
vant mouse models and CF bronchial epithelial cell lines and, second, map and assign structure to pro-inflam-
matory Pa lipid A as it accumulates and distributes during the onset of lung pathology using mass spectrometry
imaging. By defining how Pa lipid A structures condition the host for persistence, we will identify novel host-
directed therapy (HDT) targets."

Tissue fission and fusion give forms to functional organs during embryonic development. Abnormalities in these
processes can lead to congenital birth defects and syndromes such as cleft palate, Meckel-Gruber syndrome,
and persistent truncus arteriosus. During remodeling, cells must generate force, reconfigure cell contacts, and
interact with their surroundings. The mechanisms underlying the cellular and molecular regulation mechanisms
underlying tissue fission and fusion are poorly understood. The formation of mechano-sensory organs called
neuromasts in zebrafish provides an ideal model in which to decipher these processes. During neuromast
morphogenesis, the pro-neuromast splits from the migrating posterior lateral line primordium and later fuses with
skin to open tricellular junctions in skin cells; hence, I can study both tissue fission and fusion in this
morphogenetic event. In this model, my preliminary findings suggest a mechanical ‘tug of war’ between cells and
tissues in primordium splitting and neuromast fusion with the skin. In the proposed research, I will apply state-
of-the-art in vivo biophysical measurements to determine whether RhoA-mediated actomyosin drives neuromast
deposition (Aim 1). I will then use a novel protein depletion approach that offers spatial and temporal control to
test whether cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions mediate neuromast budding (Aim 2) and
investigate the mechanism by which neuromasts fuse with skin (Aim 3). The physical, molecular and cellular
principles revealed in this study will be widely applicable to morphogenetic events involving tissue fission and
fusion while maintaining the integrity of single cells. Moreover, findings from this study will improve our
understanding of congenital birth defects due to abnormal tissue fission and fusion and further inform strategies
to correct these defects. To accomplish the proposed research, I will combine my skills in cell mechanics
analyses developed as a graduate student; new skills acquired in my early postdoctoral training in zebrafish
genetics, molecular biology and high-resolution live imaging; and the proposed technical training during the K99
phase to implement in vivo biophysical measurements, including measuring in vivo cell-ECM stress and cell-cell
adhesion tension. As I start my own lab, I will be mentored by Drs. Holger Knaut, Daniele Panozzo, Anna-
Katerina Hadjantonakis, Jeremy Nance, Carsten Grashoff, and Johannes Stegmaier. They will offer not only
their scientific expertise in zebrafish genetics, biophysics, quantitative imaging, and modeling but also with their
valuable experience in mentoring students, grantsmanship, publication, establishing scientific collaborations,
and lab management. My long-term career goal is to head a research laboratory and uncover the genetic,
biophysical, cellular, and molecular regulation of cell and tissue mechanics in embryonic morphogenesis. I have
made significant progress toward this goal with research experience, successful collaborations, and publications.
However, I firmly believe that the additional technical and career training proposed during the K99 mentored
phase is necessary for me to successfully transition to my independence."

This research project will enhance our understanding of the immune responses elicited by the O-antigen of
Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), an important target in putative vaccine development. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to further our knowledge of the innate and adaptive immune responses elicited by two subtypes of
the common serogroup O2 of Kp, O2v1 and O2v2. We seek to understand how the addition of the single
branched galactose of O2v2 changes its bacterial fitness and host immune susceptibility relative to O2v1.
Further, we will determine cross-reactivity between these two subtypes and whether infection or vaccination with
one subtype confers cross-protection against the other, information critical to the design of vaccines that can
broadly target this increasingly antibiotic-resistant organism. Kp infections, including pneumonia, urinary tract
infection, and bloodstream infection, are sharply on the rise among hospitalized patients; CDC has declared that
infections with Kp and other carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales demand a threat level of urgent.
This project builds on the PI's background in bacteriology, murine models of infection, and pathogenesis studies
of Gram-negative bacteria, by focusing specifically on the Kp virulence factor O-antigen and the host
immunogenic response. We have previously demonstrated that use of bioconjugate vaccines targeting Kp are
beneficial in preventing disease and seek to increase our understanding and breadth of coverage of future
vaccines. Kp historically has eleven known serogroups of O-antigen. Recently, additional O-antigen subtypes
within these serogroups have been identified. Yet, differences in pathogenic fitness, immunogenicity, functional
antibody response, and cross-protection between related subtypes are not well understood.
We have constructed a mutant of a classical Kp strain expressing O-antigen subtype O2v2 to generate an
otherwise isogenic strain expressing O2v1. We will test if these bacteria exhibit similar phenotypic expression of
virulence factors by measuring capsule, hypermucoviscosity, fimbriae and biofilm. A well-established murine
model of pneumonia will be leveraged to determine pulmonary fitness and delineate host innate immune
response to each pathogen. Neutrophil and complement-mediated bacterial killing assays will be employed to
further explore bacterial resistance to innate immune attack, which the literature indicates may be enhanced in
O2v2 strains. Next, we will perform a range of experiments testing if O2v1 and O2v2 are cross-protective. Using
classically immunological techniques including ELISA and flow cytometry, we will determine the IgG subclasses
and effector cytokines elicited by respiratory tract infection with these pathogens. Lastly, using novel O2v1 or
O2v2 bioconjugate vaccines followed by challenge with O2v1 or O2v2 strains, we will assess cross-protection
against weight loss and mortality from pneumonia. We will further characterize antibody functionality using serum
bactericidal and opsonophagocytic killing assays. These studies will significantly advance our understanding of
immune response to Kp O-antigen and aid in vaccine design to combat this pathogen."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a rapidly growing threat to global health that is primarily driven by the
overuse and misuse of antimicrobials. The applicant’s preliminary work in Uganda confirmed what has been
noted in other resource-limited settings - children who present with febrile illnesses, particularly those with
associated respiratory symptoms, are frequently treated with antibiotic therapy despite most of them likely
having self-limited viral infections that do not require such treatment. This inappropriate dispensation of
antibiotics is in part due to the diagnostic uncertainty inherent in the reliance on clinical symptoms for diagnosis
and management of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Therefore, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostic
tools that can distinguish children with bacterial ARI from those with non-bacterial infections, thus reducing
antibiotic overuse for children presenting with this clinical syndrome. The objective of the scientific aims
proposed in this K23 application is to develop a diagnostic model that accurately predicts bacterial infection in
children with febrile ARI in Uganda. This work will facilitate the long-term goal of the applicant, which is to
become an independent investigator with expertise in diagnostic evaluation and implementation working to
improve quality of care and antimicrobial stewardship in both domestic and global contexts. Specifically, under
the mentorship of experts in the fields of emerging molecular technologies, diagnostic evaluation, and
prediction modeling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, she will (1) determine the etiology of
febrile ARI in a cohort of previously and prospectively enrolled children, enhancing the diagnostic assessment
with PCR-based and metagenomic next generation sequencing tools, (2) validate a host immune response
gene expression assay, incorporating genes previously identified to be differentially expressed in viral and
bacterial ARI, that minimizes the number of genes included to maximize feasibility in resource-constrained
settings, and (3) develop novel clinical algorithms that combine host-based classifiers with other clinical and
laboratory data to accurately predict bacterial ARI. Through pursuit of the scientific aims, the associated
experiential and hands-on laboratory and biostatistical training, and focused didactic coursework, the applicant
will address the following gaps in her knowledge: (1) molecular technologies and their role in infectious disease
diagnosis and diagnostic development, (2) clinical prediction modeling, and (3) diagnostic tool evaluation and
implementation. By the conclusion of the K23 award period, the applicant will have generated key results to
inform a competitive R01 application. She will also be well-positioned to transition into an independent
physician scientist and leading expert in diagnostic evaluation and antimicrobial stewardship in resource-
constrained settings."

By 2030, 73% of people with HIV will be ≥ 50 years of age and 78% will have cardiovascular disease. People
with HIV have a 50% increased risk of acute myocardial infarction, a 61% higher risk of heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction and > 4 fold higher rates of sudden cardiac death compared to the general
population. In addition to traditional risk factors, HIV-associated features such as chronic inflammation and
immune dysregulation in the setting of treated HIV infection are strong predictors of cardiovascular disease.
However, studies elucidating the pathogenesis of heart failure in HIV have been largely descriptive and have
thus provided limited insight into the underlying mechanisms of these disease processes. Thus, we propose to
address the pathogenesis of heart failure in people with HIV through investigating the impact of HIV, immune
activation and antiretroviral therapies on the broad range of cell types comprising the human heart. Overall,
the proposed studies will illuminate underlying mechanisms of HIV cardiomyopathy, which may be translated to
the creation of cell-type specific therapies for HIV-related cardiac diseases."

Human infection by the pathogenic free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri causes primary
amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), which in the majority (>95%) of infections end in
fatality. We have recently found that a group of phosphonate inhibitors of the glycolytic
enzyme enolase (ENO) that are well-tolerated in mammals are potent anti-amebic
compounds. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the amoeba ENO
(NfENO) is a promising target for therapeutic development and to optimize phosphonate
inhibtors to early lead stage. As part of this, we will use a small collection of inhibitors and a
series of orthologous assays to biochemically validate NfENO as target of the agents and
will determine the effect of the inhibitors on amoebae infections in a rodent disease model,
scoring the immune response to treatment as part of the effort."
10910143,"While the Amyloid(A)/Tau(T)/Neurodegeneration(N) framework has been validated against
neuropathology, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging biomarkers, its implementation in

(NfL) – is a non-disease-specific indicator of neurodegeneration/neuronal injury. Moreover,
plasma total-tau (t-tau) has large overlaps between diagnostic groups and does not correlate with
CSF t-tau. We have developed and validated a novel AD-type neurodegeneration biomarker
(referred to as brain-derived tau [BD-tau]) with capacity to complete the AT(N) framework in blood.
Our overall goal is to perform a large-scale clinical and pathophysiological validation of plasma
BD-tau. We will leverage five longitudinal, already existing, racially/ethnically diverse sporadic AD
cohorts (n = 2,594) with clinical, in vivo, and post-mortem evaluations to answer the following
specific aims: Aim 1. To compare associations of plasma BD-tau, NfL and t-tau with clinical
diagnosis of AD and longitudinal cognitive change; Aim 2. To compare AT(N) profiles and
associations for plasma BD-tau vs. NfL and t-tau; Aim 3. To compare the (added)
diagnostic value of plasma BD-tau vs. NfL and t-tau for autopsy confirmation of AD; and
Exploratory Aim 4: To compare performances of plasma BD-tau vs. NfL and t-tau in
different racial/ethnic groups. If proven, BD-tau will complete the AT(N) scheme in blood,
improving diagnostic and prognostic accuracies and confidence, as well as the prediction of
longitudinal cognitive change that are directly translatable to anti-AD clinical trials."

Generating antibodies, refining their qualities, and creating durable humoral memory are crucial parts of adaptive
immunity. The capacity of vaccines to protect against microbes draws on each facet of these processes, but even
for some approved and useful vaccines the efficacy is needs to be better. Accordingly, it is vital to decipher key
cellular and molecular processes that affect antibody (Ab) qualities. Major efforts are directed toward the
identification of ways in which intracellular sensors, mediators of intermediary metabolism, and metabolites proper
alter immune cell differentiation or function. It has long been known that malnutrition undermines immune
defenses against infection, and a body of work has suggested that protein deficiency may decrease effective Ab
responses. Nutrient supply is intrinsically linked to intracellular sensors such as mTORC1 and programming of
cellular metabolism in immune cells. For instance, experimental models of isolated protein deficiency have
documented decreases in venous concentrations of amino acids (a.a.) and lower mTORC1 activity in freshly
isolated organs from the malnourished rodents. Our work on mTORC1 in B cells found antibody responses to be
altered by B cell-restricted haplo-insufficiency of Raptor, with partially reduced activity similar in magnitude to that
reported in the setting of protein deprivation. Moreover, we – and others in parallel – uncovered evidence of
variegated hypoxia in the white pulp and lymphoid follicles after immunization and formation of germinal centers.
Preliminary in vitro and in vivo experiments provide evidence that (a) glutamine, at the physiological concentration
of non-inflamed interstitia, is limiting for fully efficient switching to IgG1 and for plasma cell differentiation, and (b)
glutaminolysis (the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, and then α-ketoglutarate) can be limiting for these
processes. These findings are the premise for the overarching model of this application: that nutrients may be
present in follicles at concentrations where either increases or further decreases alter the nature of the antibody
response as it draws on lymphocyte proliferation and function. Accordingly, in Aim 1 we will test the impact on Ab
responses of reducing a.a. supply to or utilization by mature B cells. Aim 2 will identify consequences for
metabolic and epigenetic programming of the B cells in which glutamine supply or glutaminolysis are restricted,
alone or with reduced glucose oxidation capacity. An implication of the model is that increased circulating a.a. – or
even just glutamine – could enhance outcomes of immunization. In Aim 3, we will use a newly identified endocrine
approach to test if hyperaminoacidemia increases interstitial glutamine and yields greater Ab responses or
humoral memory. As a novel facet of the experiments, we will leverage a state-of the-art development in imaging
mass spectrometry (IMS) to assess glutamine and selected metabolites in selected lymphoid micro-environments
of experimental animals. The expected outcome & impact of the proposed studies are that we will (i) provide a
ground-breaking technical advance in application of IMS to biological problems, (ii) elucidate a long-standing issue
at the nexus of nutrition and immunity, and (iii) identify a novel means of boosting antibody responses."

The evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, exists as distinct polymorphic complexes,
BAF, PBAF and ncBAF, each with differing subunit composition. Though these complexes share a
common biological function of altering chromatin architecture, it is the unique subunits within each form
of SWI/SNF that help define their genomic roles. With the identification of SWI/SNF as a tumor
suppressor, a lot of attention has been focused on how loss of subunits leverage the remaining
complexes for transcriptional output. However, focusing attention on a normal cell that needs to
constantly adjust transcriptional output to respond to a variety of external stimuli, an interesting question
remains: How do cells dynamically alter the usage of the various SWI/SNF complexes for gene
expression and do they achieve this dynamic usage by changing the amounts of each form of the
complex within cells. We have leveraged hypoxia as an environmental stimulus to address this very
question. Our preliminary studies show that hypoxic cells retain BAF and ncBAF proteins at levels similar
to those in normoxic cells, but decrease levels of PBAF members, while displaying a dependence on
BAF for expression of hypoxic genes. The overall goal of this proposal is to gain mechanistic
understanding of the dynamic regulation and usage of various forms of SWI/SNF as a response to
environmental cues, specifically hypoxic exposure. In AIM 1, we will define the composition of the various
forms of SWI/SNF, during hypoxic response, with emphasis on how varying levels of oxygen
concentration affects SWI/SNF complex levels, using both 2D and 3D cell culture models. In AIM 2, we
ask how cells use the altered stoichiometry of SWI/SNF forms for regulation of hypoxic gene expression.
In AIM 3, we seek to define the molecular mechanisms of downregulation of PBAF during hypoxia. Our
studies, will cumulatively provide a mechanistic understanding of how cells dynamically utilize the various
forms of SWI/SNF to respond to changing environmental signals. Given that many chromatin modifiers
exist in a plurality of forms, our studies will help identify mechanisms that may commonly be in play to
regulate functions and usage of these important enzyme complexes."

Heart disease remains the number one cause of death worldwide, due to the inability of the injured adult heart
to regenerate. We seek to delineate the mechanisms that govern development, disease and regeneration of the
heart and to build upon this knowledge to restore cardiac function during injury, disease and aging. In contrast
to the adult mammalian heart, which lacks regenerative capacity, the neonatal heart can efficiently regenerate
following severe injury. To explore the molecular underpinnings of neonatal cardiac regeneration, we have
analyzed global changes in gene expression and the epigenome during regeneration of the neonatal mouse
heart in comparison to later stage hearts that cannot regenerate. We have also performed single-cell RNA
sequencing of cardiomyocytes and the major non-myocyte cell types from neonatal regenerative and non-
regenerative hearts with or without injury. Integration of these comprehensive datasets has begun to reveal a
“regenerative” chromatin landscape of the heart and the transcriptional activators and repressors of this process.
The overarching goal of this project is to build upon this body of information to elucidate the mechanisms that
control the responses of the neonatal heart to injury and to harness these mechanisms to promote adult cardiac
regeneration and repair. By focusing on regenerative transcriptional circuitry and paracrine signaling
mechanisms, we intend to devise new strategies to enhance cardiomyocyte proliferation and survival,
angiogenesis and other regenerative processes mediated by various cellular constituents of the heart.
Ultimately, the molecular decoding of cardiac regeneration will provide a molecular blueprint for activating
endogenous pathways for cardiac repair and facilitate new strategies for restoring function to the injured and
aging heart."

 Primary membranous nephropathy (MN) is a major cause of nephrotic syndrome and kidney diseases.
This autoimmune condition is characterized by the accumulation of immune complexes along the glomerular
basement membrane (GBM). What triggers autoantibody production and its contribution to organ damage in MN
remains incompletely understood. As such, further understanding of these pathological events could enable
timely diagnosis and an overall improvement of treatment outcome in MN. Our previous interdisciplinary
proteomic approach identified the serine protease HTRA1 as a novel autoantigen in MN. In this “Mentored
Clinical Scientist Research Career Development (K23) Award”, mechanistic studies will be implemented to
identify the precise pathogenic HTRA1 epitopes targeted by autoantibodies and their impact on HTRA1 protein
function (Aim 1). Furthermore, contributions of HTRA1 autoantibodies as well as HTRA1 antigen accumulation
to disease development will be investigated in newly developed animal models of MN (Aim 2).
 This five-year proposal aims to support the transition of the candidate from a junior physician scientist to
an independent investigator in nephrology under the mentorship of leading experts in immunology, nephrology,
and other relevant fields (Drs. Haecker, Beck, and Hageman). Building upon the candidate’s strong clinical
experience (running the glomerular disease clinic at the University of Utah and utilizing biospecimens from the
national MN clinical research network of CureGN, ARUP, and Arkana laboratories) and prior research exposure
in glomerular disease, various intensive training modules will be designed to refine his scientific knowledge.
Career development training will also be implemented to prepare the candidate with the necessary
communication and leadership skills to become an independent investigator. Lastly, access to ample resources
to support the aforementioned scientific studies and educational programs will ensure a timely successful
execution of this proposal, allowing the candidate to begin his career path of scientific independence."

Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare subset accounting for <5% of all breast cancers. MpBC is a significant
health challenge as it exhibits the most dismal prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, worse than non-MpBC
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), with median survival rate of 8 months or less in patients with metastatic
disease. Due to a lack of druggable targets, the main therapeutic option for metastatic MpBC remains systemic
chemotherapy, despite known resistance to most cytotoxic drugs. One common molecular alteration in MpBC is
hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Additionally, we
published that MpBC also displays a gain-of-function oncogenic mutation in ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39),
which is responsible for treatment resistance, stem cell self-renewal, and lung metastasis. The mechanistic
function of RPL39 is mediated through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated nitric oxide production.
In a recently published clinical trial targeting this nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway with a pan-NOS inhibitor
NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA), high efficacy in chemorefractory TNBC patients was demonstrated.
Furthermore, in vivo studies performed showed a significant reduction in tumor growth, associated with a
significant increase in apoptosis after the alpelisib/L-NMMA combinatorial regimen. Therefore, we hypothesize
that the NOS and PI3K signaling pathways may exert their oncogenic responses synergistically to
promote aggressive tumor growth. To test this hypothesis, Specific Aim 1 seeks to demonstrate the
therapeutic efficacy of simultaneous inhibition of NOS and PI3K pathways with chemotherapy in MpBC pre-
clinical models on primary tumor growth and metastasis. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the global and RPL39-
specific ribosome translation landscape in response to NOS/PI3K inhibition in MpBC. In Specific Aim 3, the cell-
cell interactions among tumor cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid cells, and stromal cells within the tumor
microenvironment and their role in supporting cancer niche populations will be evaluated at the single-cell level
using spatial transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, CyTOF imaging systems, and a multi-modal data analysis
model. This study thus proposes a mechanistic investigation of a combinatorial targeted approach against the
two key pathways in MpBC, identifies cell–cell interactions, and develops unique crosstalk models that will
effectively predict outcome and treatment response and complement our recently funded U01 clinical trial on
MpBC patients."
10896455,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A major frontier of genomic medicine is to convert annotations of disease-associated variants
and gene expression states into actionable therapeutic targets. Genomic sequence editing by
CRISPR/Cas has garnered heightened interest as potential therapeutics, but still carries risks of
off-target mutagenicity, and is less effective at targeting cis-regulatory elements, where the
majority of disease-associated variants reside. A conceptual alternative to DNA sequence
editing is to deliver a brief pulse of a synthetic therapeutic that can trigger memorized silencing
of target promoters and enhancers in a ""hit-and-run"" strategy, bypassing concerns of
mutagenicity associated with DNA sequence editing, and immunogenicity associated with
constitutive expression of CRISPR/Cas components. In practice, engineering sustained
epigenetic transcriptional silencing has had mixed success, but recent efforts demonstrate
that constructing specific combinations of chromatin signals -- broadly encompassing cis-
regulatory elements, regulatory protein complexes, and covalent chromatin modifications --
can be critical for success. However, existing tools for manipulating chromatin signals at high
throughput are limited in combinatorial capacity. This proposal builds the knowledge base and
generalizable CRISPR/Cas tools to overcome such limitations to enable systematic engineering
of epigenetic silencing memory across genomic loci in human cells. The results will pave the
way for future epigenetic therapeutics that expand the directly targetable portion of the human
genome, including cis-regulatory elements that can be highly specific with respect to cell types
and disease pathophysiology. To achieve these objectives, I am proposing to train in
CRISPR/Cas synthetic biology, functional genomics, single-cell methods and neurogenetics.
This training will be mentored by a co-mentorhsip team consisting of Dr. Luke Gilbert (UCSF,
Innovative Genomics Institute, and Arc Institute), Dr. Howard Chang (Stanford) and Dr. Thomas
Montine (Stanford), each providing critical intellectual and physical resources for specific areas
proposed in the training plan and my career development. My career goal is to conduct research
at the forefront of genome regulation and genomic medicine as an academic principle
investigator."

African Americans have double the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as compared to white Americans.
We do not sufficiently understand the causes of this health disparity. In particular, there continues to be a
dearth of data on the cognitive and neural changes that occur across the lifespan in older African Americans
and how these relate to health and lifestyle, environmental, and genetic risk factors for AD. During the current
grant cycle, we have shown that low levels of aerobic fitness and poor sleep quality may be key drivers of
cognitive decline and AD in older African Americans. However, the impact of these potentially-modifiable
health and lifestyle variables are not uniform across all individuals: rather, genetic variations and socio-
environmental factors interact in complex ways to moderate how aerobic fitness and sleep quality influence
brain health. To investigate these knowledge gaps further, we will leverage our track record of sixteen years
(2006-2022) of deep community engagement through innovative partnerships with churches, senior centers,
medical clinics, public housing and other organizations that serve the greater Newark, NJ area that has
contributed to our success in enrolling older African Americans. Specifically, we will recruit 240 cognitively
healthy participants ages 60 and above, and retest them in years 3 and 4 for their Cycle II (two-year) follow up.
All participants who are age 80 or above will be tested every year, due to higher likelihood of decline within one
year. Participants who show preliminary signs of cognitive decline—but not sufficient to be classified as mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD—will also be tested annually. Despite the deaths of almost 10% of our cohort
from Covid-19, we still project carrying forward 290 participants from our current R01 and previous R56 for
Cycle III (four-year), Cycle IV (six-year) and/or Cycle V (8-year) assessments. Thus, modulo attrition, we
project a net cohort of 530 people for this study representing a longitudinally-followed cohort of older African
Americans. In addition to our prior cognitive, health, lifestyle, genetic, and MRI assessments, we now include
an expanded focus on Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) as well as the addition of two blood-based
biomarkers for AD neuropathology: the ratio of 42 to 40 amino acid-long amyloid β, a marker of plaque
pathology, and phosphorylated tau, a marker of AD-related tau phosphorylation and secretion. Our existing
community engagement and research infrastructure will enable the following four new Specific Aims: (1)
Examine whether aerobic fitness and sleep quality interact with genetic variations to influence cognitive
performance, neural function, and neuropathology in older African Americans; (2) Expand methodologies for
studying SDOH by assessing the predictive value of a novel measure of neighborhood disadvantage that is
based on spatial proximity to abandoned buildings; (3) Evaluate our novel cognitive and neural markers as
measures of prodromal AD; and (4) Determine how aerobic fitness and sleep quality interact with genetics to
predict longitudinal changes in cognition and AD neuropathology as well as conversion to MCI or AD."
10910153,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Reliable diagnostic digital tools are needed for the early detection of cognitive dysfunction and stratification of
early Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) risk among older adults at risk for Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). T2DM is a well-
known accelerator of cognitive decline and AD risk: T2DM is linked to dysfunction in episodic memory and
executive functions, and proffers a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for AD. The prediabetes stage may be key to
understanding this accelerated aging as it could provide an optimal window into the initial pathophysiological
changes that trigger cognitive dysfunction and AD. However, uncertainty surrounds the role of hyperglycemia
in the prediabetic stage, perhaps because only assessing peaks in glucose sporadically using single time-point
measurements like hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting glucose leaves key aspects of dysglycemia
unexamined. These limitations open the possibility that more precise measurement of dysglycemia will yield a
more definitive understanding of the mechanisms by which T2DM pathophysiology modifies cognitive function
and AD risk, which are presently unknown. We will be the first to leverage cutting-edge Continuous Glucose
Monitoring (CGM) technology to investigate the precise associations between dysglycemia, cognitive function,
and key AD biomarkers in older adults with at risk for T2DM. CGM allows for the precise assessment of
fluctuations in glucose levels to show individualized patterns of hyper- and hypoglycemia over days- a major
component of dysglycemia not reflected in fasting glucose or HbA1c. Because CGM technology has almost
exclusively been used by people with a T2DM diagnosis, examining those at risk for T2DM is innovative. Our
established multidisciplinary research team, with expertise in behavioral medicine, endocrinology, geriatrics,
neuropsychology, and neurology, and numerous years of collaborative clinical research experience, is well-
positioned to examine among 40 older adults at risk for T2DM (a) the association of glycemic fluctuations with
cognitive dysfunction in episodic memory and executive functions, key domains that show decrements both
early in the AD trajectory, and in prediabetes, and (b) explore, for the first time, the association of glycemic
fluctuations with well-established biomarkers of early AD risk. These plasma-based AD biomarkers of tau
phosphorylation and amyloid burden are cost-effective, require minimally invasive blood draws, and minute
amounts of brain-specific proteins in blood for use with ultrasensitive immunoassays. By leveraging precise,
scalable technology to assess early glycemic fluctuations, and sensitive screening tools for early AD risk, this
innovative proposal stands to make both scientific and technological advances in aging and AD risk research.
Support for our hypotheses would introduce cost-effective, user-friendly CGM technology as a novel, sensitive,
digital biomarker for the early detection of cognitive dysfunction and stratification of AD risk, ultimately, helping
older adults preserve cognitive function into later life."

 Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as Klebsiella
aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible treatment failure and
mortality rates up to 50% and 30%, respectively. Meropenem is a mainstay for the treatment of HAP, but
antibiotic resistance continues to erode its clinical efficacy. Importantly, the efficacy of beta-lactams
depends on achieving adequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) exposures; however, many
patients with HAP experience inadequate PK/PD because of changes in PK caused by critically illness.
Precision Dosing strategies can overcome PK variability caused by critical illness, but Precision Dosing
requires robust models; such models for critically ill patients who develop kidney injury and require
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are currently lacking for HAP patients. Without Precision
Dosing models to help guide antibiotic dosing, these vulnerable patients will continue to experience high
rates of treatment failure and death. Whereas the status quo treatment of HAP patients requiring CRRT
uses population-based dosing schemes, our proposal will innovate Precision Dosing (i.e., individualized)
strategies for patients with HAP. We will leverage the infrastructure of the Successful Clinical Response In
Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center to robustly address the unmet needs of patients
on CRRT. Our long-term goal is to develop Precision Dosing strategies that overcome PK variability
caused by severe illness. The project objective is to utilize the infrastructure, samples, and data collected
in SCRIPT to develop Precision Dosing models for HAP. Our central hypothesis is: (1) CRRT leads to
variability in beta-lactam PK with standard “one-size-fits all” HAP dosing regimens which (2) increases the
risk of clinical treatment failure in HAP, (3) requiring Precision Dosing schemes. The rationale for our
study is that Precision Dosing is needed for CRRT patients with HAP and that these approaches must be
translated clinically. In Aim 1, we will develop and qualify Precision Dosing models for meropenem in
CRRT. In Aim 2, we will describe meropenem PK/PD target attainment in plasma and in the lung for
patients requiring CRRT. In Aim 3, we will create a web-based dosing calculator for translation to practice.
 Our study will have a positive clinical impact by providing clinicians with the tools necessary to
ensure that each patient’s dosing is optimized. This research is significant because it addresses a critical
unmet need for optimized therapy. Upon completion, our study will have robustly characterized alveolar PK
in CRRT patients, filling a gap in the rigor of prior research. We will have translated our Precision Dosing
model predictions into actionable dosing regimens, which is innovative as no such calculators exist. Our
Precision Dosing calculator will be evaluated in a future R01-funded randomized controlled trial."

The basis of cellular immunity is the recognition by T cells of foreign peptides in association with major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins on the cell surface. CD8 T cells, the subset most associated with
cytolysis, are conventionally believed to recognize peptides bound to the classical, hyper-polymorphic MHC class
Ia molecules (HLA-A, B, and C in humans); however, a handful of studies have suggested that CD8 T cells can
also recognize pathogen-derived peptides in the context of MHC-E (Qa-1 in mice, HLA-E in humans), a nearly
invariant non-classical MHC-Ib molecule typically associated with the regulation of natural killer cell function. In
limited cases, MHC-E-restricted CD8 T cells have been shown to exert potent antiviral effects, but extremely
little is known about how common these responses are in viral infections, what kinds of effector functions they
generally exhibit, how they are regulated, and what antigen presentation pathways drive them. This proposal will
shed light on this enigmatic aspect of cellular immunity, taking advantage of a recently identified Qa-1-restricted
CD8 T cell epitope from influenza A virus called M-SL9. This epitope drives a CD8 T cell response that is co-
dominant with conventional MHC-Ia-restricted epitopes and in preliminary studies appears to protect mice from
weight loss and clinical severity during flu infection. Aim 1 of this research plan will detail the cellular pathways
by which this model Qa-1-restricted epitope is processed, transported, and presented in flu-infected cells. These
studies will be facilitated by an M-SL9-specific CD8 T cell hybridoma line that acts as a highly sensitive reporter
of M-SL9/Qa-1 presentation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Qa-1-restricted CD8 T cells occur commonly in
viral infections and that they protect the host from severe disease, similarly to MHC-Ia-restricted CD8 T cells. An
immunopeptidomics approach will be used to discover Qa-1 epitopes in the context of influenza A virus and
mouse hepatitis virus 1, a beta-coronavirus in the same family as SARS-CoV-2. An mRNA-based vaccination
strategy will be used to raise CD8 T cells against identified Qa-1 epitopes in mice, followed by a challenge with
the corresponding virus and monitoring of disease severity. These results will illuminate a promising but poorly
understood aspect of the cellular immune response, with potential benefits for the design of new vaccines or
immune therapies against infectious diseases and cancer. This proposal will promote the applicant’s career
goals of initiating an independent research career with a rapid pace of productivity, laying a foundation of valuable
data that will enable several viable follow-up studies, and ultimately gaining better understanding the importance
of unconventional forms of antigen presentation in human health. This study will also take place in a broader
context that prioritizes the applicant’s career development by emphasizing feedback from senior scientists,
mentoring trainees, and engaging with current literature and innovative research on and off campus."
10894913,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic stress is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for sporadic AD. Dysregulation of the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis) is common in AD patients. By stimulating corticotropin-releasing
hormone (CRH) expression and glucocorticoid secretion, chronic stress exposure exacerbates Aβ and tau
pathologies and cognitive decline. AgRP neurons, located in the arcuate nucleus, co-express GABA and send
extensive projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Our recent studies have shown that
chronic stress decreases firing rates of AgRP neurons, and that stimulating AgRP neurons can reverse chronic
stress-induced behavioral deficits, including memory impairment. HPA responses to stress can also be
dampened by stimulating AgRP neurons. In addition, we provide novel preliminary data showing that aging
induces silencing of AgRP neurons. We hypothesize that chronic stress and aging converge to silence AgRP
neurons, which leads to reduced inhibitory inputs to the PVN. This weakens negative feedback and drives HPA
hyperactivity, which in turn accelerates brain aging and worsens AD pathologies. To test this hypothesis, we
propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify molecular mechanisms of chronic stress- and aging-
induced silencing of AgRP neurons. In Aim 2, we will determine whether chronic stress-induced inhibition of
AgRP neuron activity contributes to overstimulation of the HPA axis and stress-exacerbated Aβ and tau
pathologies. In Aim 3, we will determine whether age-induced silencing of AgRP neurons accelerates the
progression of Aβ accumulation and cognitive decline."

Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are one of the most common
disorders in adults aged 65 or above. Older Chinese Americans have a high risk of inaccurate diagnosis or
delayed diagnosis of AD/ADRD due to the absence of culturally and linguistically appropriate assessment
batteries and normative data. The National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) developed a Mandarin
version of the Uniform Data Set (UDS) test battery for evaluation of older Chinese Americans in AD/ADRD
research. However, several important limitations have been observed for this specific battery. For example, the
translations did not include Cantonese, which together with Mandarin, is the most commonly spoken language
in the US after English and Spanish. It is important to note that Cantonese and Mandarin are significantly different
from one another in both spoken and written forms. Secondly, the test items and instructions that comprise the
overall battery were developed through verbatim translations, which are not always culturally and linguistically
relevant to the diverse older Chinese American population. Furthermore, a lack of normative data creates
barriers to accurate interpretation, diagnosis, and prognostication of AD/ADRD. The proposed study aims to
develop minimally biased Mandarin and Cantonese versions of the NACC UDS test battery, guided by the pilot
data collected for the Mandarin version of the current UDS battery (Aim 1). The team will also generate
sociodemographic-adjusted normative data using 400 older Chinese Americans with normal cognition (Aim 2)
at the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS;
n=200) and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF; n=200). Lastly, the team will examine if cognitive
performance correlates with corresponding neuroanatomical regions identified via brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) (Aim 3). 300 participants will be required for the MRI sub-study; 100 participants will come from
the 400 cognitively normal participants already enrolled in Aim 2 (from each site: n=50), while an additional 100
MCI and 100 AD/ADRD (from each site: n=50 MCI and n=50 AD/ADRD) will need to be recruited. Participants
must be primarily Mandarin/Cantonese speaking and aged 65 or above. All enrollees will undergo a dementia
evaluation at the ADRCs using the newly developed Chinese versions of the NACC UDS battery. The study PIs
(Li & Tee) have been successful in recruiting and evaluating Chinese speaking older adults at their respective
ADRCs, generating a combined sample of >600 participants. This cohort will provide a recruitment pipeline for
the proposed study. The PIs also have established relationship with stakeholders in the older Chinese
communities to assist with recruitment should it become a challenge. This novel project will provide linguistically
and culturally appropriate assessment tools for future cross-geographic studies that include older Chinese
Americans and add value to the NACC research database. The study results will also provide normative data for
the detection and diagnosis of cognitive deficits in this underserved population, which is currently nonexistent."

Establishing precise synaptic connections is critical for normal brain function. Synaptic dysfunction can lead to
neuronal hyperexcitability, contributing to disorders including epilepsy. Microglia are the dominant immune cells
in the brain and play multiple roles in synaptic development, modulating neuronal excitability, and engulfing
excess excitatory synapses. However, the mechanisms by which microglia impact synapses have largely been
investigated with fixed tissue histology or in limited regions of the adult brain using rodent models. In fact,
microglial engulfment of whole synapses has not been directly observed in the developing brain. In this proposal,
I will use a zebrafish model system to study microglial-synapse interactions in the intact developing brain. My
recently published work identified a population of synapse-associated microglia (SAMs) enriched in the zebrafish
hindbrain and defined its transcriptional profile by single-cell and regional bulk sequencing. In this proposal, I will
examine this microglial subset using a combination of live imaging and candidate gene deletion in both
physiology and in the context of hyperexcitability. Aim 1 will determine if microglia engulf synapses during
development and the impact of immune activation or after deletion of a core lysosomal protease known as
cathepsin b (ctsba) - a top candidate from my transcriptomic work. Aim 2 will further assess these phenotypes
in the context of chemically induced hyperexcitability and use startle behavior recordings to assess the impact
on neural circuit function. Finally, in Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will define the molecular mechanisms regulating
lysosome activity during microglia phagocytosis and transcriptionally profile microglia following neuronal
hyperexcitability. Together these studies will open a distinct direction using a new model to identify molecular
pathways that regulate microglia-synaptic interactions with the potential to investigate non-neuronal therapeutic
interventions that impact development and disease states such as epilepsy."

Survivors of childhood cancer require life-long healthcare to improve quality of life and health. However, the
majority of adult survivors of childhood cancer, including those with public health insurance (primarily
Medicaid), lack long-term healthcare. There are crucial gaps in our current understanding of disparities in
patient care and the modifiable factors that create and perpetuate disparities in care among childhood cancer
survivors in the Medicaid system. This study will use qualitative and survey research methods to systematically
assess survivor experience of care in the Medicaid system and determine sources of disparities affecting care
experience among adult survivors of childhood cancer. We anticipate contacting for potential recruitment a
total of 2,700 adult survivors insured with Medicaid from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS),
including: 20 survivors for qualitative survivor interviews (Aim 1), among whom 8 survivors will participate in a
Delphi panel (Aim 2); 144 survivors for a pilot survey (Aim 2); and 2,536 survivors for an expanded survey (Aim
3). For Aim 1, we will also include 10 stakeholder participants (care providers and financial navigators) from
CCSS participating institutions for qualitative stakeholder interviews. The specific aims are as follows. Aim 1:
Use qualitative methods to explore multi-level barriers to quality healthcare for adult survivors of childhood
cancer in the Medicaid system. Aim 2: Develop and validate a survey to quantify survivor experiences with the
Medicaid system. Aim 3: Assess racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, rural-urban, and sex disparities in survivor
experiences with insurance and healthcare in Medicaid, and how disparities are related to survivor-,
community-, and state-level characteristics. The focus of this study aligns with the NIMHD’s research priority to
understand and reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality, and sex. Data
gained from this study will form the foundation for an R01 proposal to survey state-specific cancer survivor
cohorts, with the goal of informing interventions that promote equitable, high-quality care based on state
Medicaid program rules. The candidate’s long-term career goal is to become an independent scientist with a
research program focused on addressing disparities in health and healthcare after childhood cancer. Under the
mentorship of international experts in health disparities/minority health and cancer survivorship, the candidate
will accomplish her short-term goals to 1) develop expertise in health disparities and implementation science,
2) acquire qualitative and survey research skills, 3) understand patient experience in pediatric oncology and
cancer survivorship, and 4) improve research leadership and management skills to complete transition to
independence. The integrated training plan includes a mix of didactic courses, hands-on learning activities, and
focused multidisciplinary mentorship that will advance the candidate’s research skills and ensure her transition
to a fully independent investigator."

leukemia (AML). Dr. Foltz seeks to integrate her wet-lab and computational training to delineate the mechanisms
of resistance to NK cell therapy. Her long-term career goal is to translate these findings into the clinic.
Research Career Development Plan: Dr. Foltz is pursuing an independent tenure track investigator position.
During this project, she will expand her expertise in genomic research and enhance her skills as a leader and
mentor, which is necessary for effectively running a research laboratory. She will attend relevant genomics and
epigenomics seminars and journal clubs, participate in early investigator networking groups, leadership courses,
grant writing workshops, and present her research at national and international conferences.
Research Project: The long-term goal of her proposal is to define novel mechanisms underlying the regulation
of NK cell anti-leukemia function and to translate these findings into the clinic through her established
collaborations. Recently, NK cell therapies have included NK cells that possess memory—the ability to
remember a prior activation, culminating in a more rapid and proficient response upon a secondary challenge.
Cytokine-induced memory-like (ML) NK cells are generated through brief IL-12/15/18 activation, followed by
differentiation in vitro, or in vivo within AML patients to become ML. Patients treated with ML NK cells have
improved clinical outcomes compared to cNK cells; however, not all patients respond. Based upon previous
literature and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that ML NK cells exert unique immune pressure on AML
driving differential AML resistance mechanisms and unique activation of ML NK versus conventional NK (cNK)
cells. This will be interrogated in the following aims: Aim 1: We will elucidate the transcription factors and
epigenetic changes underlying cNK versus ML NK cell anti-leukemia functionality. Here we will determine the
role of TOX, transcription factor on ML NK cell function, using CRISPR loss-of-function (LoF). We will also define
how AML modulates the epigenome of ML and cNK cells with multiomic approaches. Aim 2: We will determine
how ML NK cells edit the phenotype of leukemia. Here, we will delineate how AML resistance to ML NK cells is
distinct from AML resistant to cNK based upon differential KIR sensitivity and LAG-3 expression using genomic
analysis, flow cytometry, and mechanistic LoF in vitro and murine xenograft models. Together, these findings
lay the groundwork for Dr. Foltz’s research career on the mechanisms underlying NK cell clinical efficacy."

My career goal is to build a translational program of research that investigates the developmental origins of
psychiatric disease, with a focus on perinatal mechanisms by which adversity can be transmitted from parents
to their children. To date, I have obtained extensive training in the assessment of adversity and psychiatric
symptomatology in historically minoritized families, maternal-infant cortisol functioning, infant fMRI, and
perinatal mental health. My career development plan builds on this knowledge base by providing crucial,
intensive training in the imaging and analysis of fetal brain networks, ecological momentary assessment,
advanced longitudinal statistics, and fetal ECG. Completion of the proposed research and training is essential
to prepare me to lead a lab that leverages multimodal developmental neuroscience techniques to discover risk
and resilience processes during the earliest stages of life, which may help to disrupt the intergenerational
transmission of health disparities.
Research Project: Exposure to maternal stress during pregnancy is one of the most robust transdiagnostic
risk factors for psychiatric illness across the lifespan. Yet we lack critical information about the features of
stress that are most salient for fetal biology, the intrauterine mechanisms that link maternal stress to child
psychiatric risk, and whether there are sensitive windows when fetal biology is most strongly impacted by
maternal stress. Using a multimodal approach, the goal of this K99/R00 is to examine intraindividual variation
in maternal prenatal stress as a unique predictor of two candidate mechanisms underlying psychiatric risk in
children: fetal autonomic nervous system (ANS) development and fetal functional neurocircuitry. In the K99
portion of this award, we will leverage a repeated measures longitudinal design to examine associations
between real-world variation in maternal stress and fetal ANS development across 14 weeks of pregnancy,
including examination of sensitive windows (Aim 1). We will also examine how intraindividual variation in
maternal stress relates to long-term trajectory of fetal ANS development and fetal neurocircuitry, predicting that
stress unpredictability will uniquely impact fetal neurodevelopment (Aim 2). The R00 project will provide
necessary context to this neuromaturational model by evaluating how interactions across stress-responsive
systems (HPA axis and ANS) and maternal history of lifetime adversity modulate stress-related programming
of the fetal brain in a high-risk cohort. In the R00, we will additionally assess whether adversity-related
signatures in the fetal brain persist into infancy (Aim 3). This line of research has potential to isolate the
beginning of developmental cascades that underscore emergence of depression and other psychiatric
disorders, thus informing interventions that can leverage the unparalleled plasticity of the developing brain."
10912771,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis-induced immune paralysis (IP) is associated with consequential and often long-term effects including
susceptibility to secondary and opportunistic pathogens, and persistent immune disturbances that may culminate
in low-grade inflammation and death. Alterations in immune cell metabolism and impaired cell signaling are
pathophysiologic features of sepsis-induced IP. There is a strong scientific premise supporting the influential role
of fatty acids (FA) and their acyl carnitine (AC) metabolites in cellular energy metabolism, immune signaling, and
modulation of cytokine release. These concepts highlight the potential role of metabolites as active contributors
to disease pathophysiology rather than solely representing consequences of underlying pathways. To address
this paradigm, Lisa Torres, MD, MS, proposes this career development award with the overall objective to
characterize metabolic and protein biomarkers of septic IP relative to the most widely accepted surrogate biomarker
of IP, CD14+ monocyte HLA-DR expression. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, Dr.
Torres proposes the following Aims in a cohort of critically septic and non-septic patients, stratified by presence
or absence of IP: (1) determine the relationship between dysregulated FA metabolism and sepsis-induced IP;
(2) characterize the role of immune paralyzed response proteins (IPRPs) as cellular mediators and candidate
biomarkers associated with sepsis-induced IP; and (3) explore the effect of IP as a mediating variable between
sepsis and patient outcomes. In Aim 1, Dr. Torres will measure fatty acid oxidation (FAO) utilization and perform
metabolic tracing with 13C-FAs to assess AC synthesis in PBMCs from recruited patients (N=280). In Aim 2, Dr.
Torres will use a THP-1 monocyte-like cell line and patient PBMCs (Aim 1) to determine the impact of IPRP
agonists on cellular activation. She will also measure IPRPs in plasma of recruited patients (Aim 1). In Aim 3,
Dr. Torres will use causal inference methods to estimate the effect of IP as a mediator on the causal pathway
between sepsis and adverse patient outcomes. Dr. Torres's long-term career goal is to become an independent
researcher in sepsis translational investigation and molecular epidemiology, engaged in understanding
endotypes and mechanisms that drive pathogenesis amongst critically ill patients. In this career development
award, her goals are to gain focused training in FA metabolism; become proficient in immune cell signaling
pathways of inflammation and inhibition of activation; develop skills to design, recruit and retain a cohort of
critically ill subjects to explore the clinical relevance of patient characteristics and sepsis-induced IP on outcomes
using causal inference methods; and build expertise in statistical analysis of complex biological data. She will
accomplish this through mentoring, coursework, dissemination of research, and hands-on-experience, all
necessary for her future success."

Adolescent substance use disorder is a public health crisis with over 1 million youth and young adults affected
each year in the United States. County-level policies are well-positioned to reduce adolescent substance use
disorder through funding and regulatory policies; however, the extant literature documents multiple failures in
attempts to effectively leverage policy mechanisms. The challenges of aligning political will, multisector
collaboration, use of research evidence, and resource commitments are well-known problems in the public
policy and public administration literature. To date, the field of behavioral health policy science does not have a
well-supported method of policy design that overcomes downstream policy implementation challenges. We
propose to study a method of policy formation, Policy Codesign, designed to anticipate multiple barriers in the
downstream implementation of evidence-based, adolescent SUD services. The participant structure and
process of Policy Codesign draws from the public policy model of coproduction as well as engineering-based
codesign and is supported by promising, preliminary studies. The process includes well-defined policy
formation stages within a multisector and community-engagement framework, including: Values mapping,
Information gathering, Information integration, Prototyping, Testing, Implementation. The current single-arm,
observational study with two geographically diverse counties in Washington State will inform the research
procedures to prepare for a rigorous trial of Policy Codesign in counties in Washington State, New York, and
Connecticut. The project’s specific aims are 1) to examine the acceptability of Policy Codesign and perceived
feasibility of developed adolescent SUD policies, 2) to measure changes in social network growth, cohesion,
and bridging activities among multiple sectors central to behavioral health policy implementation, and 3) to
examine the perceived replicability of Policy Codesign among well-established behavioral health policy
intermediaries. The project is innovative as the first test of a policy design strategy intended to solve
downstream implementation problems in evidence-based, adolescent SUD prevention. If found to be effective,
Policy Codesign would significantly advance the field’s ability to translate and sustain policy-based solutions to
address adolescent substance use. The core investigative team (Walker, Ahrens, Owens) is well-suited to
carry out the project with extensive practical expertise in real world behavioral health policy design and
community-engaged research. The team is supported by leading policy (Purtle), implementation (Saldana,
Palinkas, Aarons) and adolescent SUD treatment (Hogue) researchers widely regarded as the top experts in
their fields, as well as behavioral health policy and health design organizations actively involved with county
policymaking in adolescent behavioral health systems."
10931585,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this 5-year K23 proposal is to support Taylor Crouch, PhD, in her
development as an independent investigator in the overlapping areas of chronic pain and
addiction, with a focus on enhancing uptake of evidence-based nonpharmacological chronic
pain interventions and reducing reliance on long term opioid therapy (LTOT). Evidence-based
behavioral interventions for pain are among the most effective and safe treatments, but
utilization remains low, especially among patients on LTOT. The risks of LTOT, including opioid
use disorder and overdoses, are well-established, but complex dependence can limit patients’
readiness to try something different. Two key barriers to uptake of nonpharmacological
interventions have been identified as low motivation and logistical barriers to care. Two existing
evidence-based interventions to enhance motivation and support behavior change, Motivational
Interviewing (MI) and Contingency Management (CM), have promise for enhancing readiness to
change among patients with chronic pain displaying risks on LTOT, and eHealth interventions
can improve access and reach of interventions. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to
develop a MI/CM eHealth intervention to increase readiness to utilize nonpharmacological
treatments and reduce reliance on opioids among individuals displaying risk on LTOT. Specific
Aims are: Aim 1: To inform intervention approach, conduct exploratory testing with providers
and patients to clarify needs/barriers, consolidate existing theory/evidence using the Medical
Research Council framework, and complete initial testing of intervention ingredients. Aim 2:
Develop an alpha prototype MI/CM eHealth intervention aimed at enhancing motivation to utilize
nonpharmacological treatments and reduce opioid reliance, using the Computerized
Intervention Authoring System, and assess usability. Aim 3: Develop beta and conduct a pilot
randomized clinical trial to assess feasibility and acceptability. At the completion of the pilot trial
in Aim 3, the intervention will be ready to be tested in an R01 to evaluate its efficacy in
enhancing not only motivation, but action toward reduced opioid use and utilization of evidence-
based non-opioid CP interventions. This proposal represents a 5-year comprehensive
mentoring, training, and research plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Crouch, to a career as a
successful independent investigator. Dr. Crouch has background training and expertise in
behavior change, motivation, addictive behaviors, and behavioral chronic pain interventions,
and through her comprehensive training plan she will be positioned to become a leader in these
areas and further develop her expertise in implementation science and clinical trials."
10744765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, increasing numbers of women are experiencing pregnancy complications such as
preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension that can put their own and their children’s immediate
and long-term health at risk. In particular, these hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with
increased incidence of postnatal cardiovascular disease in women. The link appears to be the placenta, an
organ that both regulates nutrient flow to the developing fetus and influences maternal cardiovascular function.
Nonpersistent endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including bisphenols found in plastics and phthalates
found in personal care products, have been associated with cardiovascular disease and may also be
associated with placental dysfunction. Over the course of my masters, doctoral, and postdoctoral training, I
have begun to develop a portfolio of published research in both environmental and reproductive epidemiology,
with a particular emphasis on identifying underlying biological mechanisms. My prior education and experience
positions me well to undertake my proposed K99/R00 research project: examining relations among maternal
exposure to nonpersistent EDCs, biomarkers of placental dysfunction, and indicators of maternal
cardiovascular disease both before and after pregnancy. This Pathway to Independence Award will provide the
additional mentorship and expertise I need to transition to faculty and successfully compete for funding as a
principal investigator. My training plan includes formal courses, workshops and seminars, directed readings,
and apprenticeships to develop skills in 1) EDCs, environmental epidemiology, and exposure assessment, 2)
advanced statistical methods, and 3) the intersection between placental and cardiovascular health. In the K99
phase of my research, I will leverage data currently being collected in the New York University (NYU)
Children’s Health and Environment Study (CHES) that includes both prenatal maternal biomarker and
questionnaire data as well as postnatal maternal cardiovascular measures. In the R00 phase, I will incorporate
additional preconception data from the NYU Factors Influencing Reproductive Success and Time to Pregnancy
(FIRST) Study. Specific Aims include 1) examining relations of maternal prenatal urinary phthalate and
bisphenol levels to maternal biomarkers of placental development, and trimester-specific effects of EDCs on
placental size at birth, 2) examining relations of prenatal urinary phthalate and bisphenol levels measured in
three trimesters of pregnancy to maternal clinical cardiovascular risk factors at 1 and 2 years postpartum in
CHES, and 3) assessing relations among maternal preconception phthalate and bisphenol exposure,
preconception cardiovascular risk factors, time to pregnancy, and placental growth and development using
combined CHES and FIRST data. These training and research activities will increase my expertise as an
environmental epidemiologist and prepare me to successfully compete for R01 funding as an independent
investigator with a focus on reproductive and women’s health."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Some CVD risk factors
are shared between people with T1D and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, differences in dyslipidemia,
severity of insulin resistance, disease onset, responses to glycemic control, and presence of autoimmunity
suggest that the pathogenesis of CVD may differ between T1D and T2D. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major
risk factor for CVD in T1D; but while it occurs in 40% of those with T1D, CVD is still the major cause of
mortality in those without DN. Autoimmunity may also contribute to CVD, since the risks of atherosclerosis are
elevated in several autoimmune diseases. Understanding the pathogenesis of CVD in TID is hampered also by
the lack of comparative pathological studies of coronary vessels of aging people with T1D versus T2D and
non-diabetic subjects. Preliminary studies from the Medalist Study, a large cohort (n=1019) with >50 years of
insulin-dependent T1D, showed that while only 13% have DN, 40% exhibited significant CVD history, which
correlated with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores by CT and myocardial dysfunction by cardiac MRI
(CMR). While >90% of Medalists possess high-risk HLA alleles for classic autoimmune T1D, 8% also have
known genes for monogenic diabetes. The Medalist biobank includes plasma/serum samples and postmortem
organ specimens (hearts with coronary vessels, aortae, kidney, pancreases and others). Pilot studies in
Medalists provide the first extensive characterizations of inflammatory and metabolomics profiles of T1D and
their associations with CAC scores and CMR parameters, which may indicate differences with published data
on T2D. Pilot morphological studies of Medalists’ coronary vessels clearly identified immune cell infiltrates,
including CD3+ T-cells. The role of autoimmunity in exacerbating atherosclerosis is clearly demonstrated by
studies using newly-created ApoE-/-/NOD mice with autoimmune diabetes closely mimicking T1D, which
exhibited significantly more atherosclerotic plaques containing elevated subsets of pro-inflammatory T-cells
and less regulatory T-cells than in non-diabetic ApoE-/-/CongNOD control mice. In this proposal, we aim to
characterize CVD in T1D by clinical, biochemical, imaging, metabolomic and pathological studies, and their
associations with autoimmunity, via comparative studies of the Medalist cohort with T2D, monogenic diabetes
and non-diabetic subjects. Our specific aims are as follows: Sp. Aim 1: To characterize atherosclerosis and
myocardial structure and function in type 1 diabetes of long duration (Joslin Medalist Study) by CVD history
and imaging, presence of autoimmunity, beta cell function, inflammatory and metabolomics markers, metabolic
control and microvascular diseases. Sp. Aim 2: To compare the plaque characteristics and composition of
immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, B-cells and T-cells (CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) and
subtypes of T-cells (Treg, Tfh, Th1 and Th17) in the atherosclerotic plaques of the coronary vessels and
peripheral arteries from patients with T1D, T2D, monogenic diabetes and no DM."

The dorsal endopiriform nucleus (DEn) is a highly conserved structure found in mammalian brains that is
developmentally related to the claustrum and has been linked to the claustrum's role as the “seat of
consciousness”. The DEn is connected to more limbic regions than the claustrum, has a very dense projection
to infralimbic cortex, and receives strong inputs from sensory cortices especially olfactory and gustatory regions.
While the DEn's role in behavior remains largely unknown beyond contributing to the generation of seizure
activity, it has long been known to have extremely high levels of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor (MOR,
DOR, and KOR) protein and mRNA. In preliminary studies we discovered a mostly non-dopaminergic ventral
tegmental area (VTA) projection to the DEn; these neurons show a significantly stronger hyperpolarization in
response to the MOR agonist DAMGO than any other VTA projection we have investigated. This is an exciting
find because opioid reward, including intra-VTA opioid reward, is dopamine independent in opioid naïve animals.
Thus, this non-dopaminergic, MOR sensitive projection may contribute to this opioid reward. Since the DEn
receives inputs from a variety of sensory cortices, this is also a potential site of direct interaction between
reinforcement encoding from the VTA and sensory cue information. Here we propose to anatomically map the
VTA innervation of the DEn, characterize the VTA  DEn synaptic connectivity including its MOR sensitivity,
and test whether selective modulation of this circuit connection produces reward or promotes learning or salience
signaling. Together these studies will lay the groundwork for understanding a previously unstudied but highly
opioid sensitive output of the VTA to an opioid receptor enriched brain region situated to integrate information
from across cerebral cortex."

Exposure to racial discrimination has long been identified as a key social determinant of substance use that
stratifies by race/ethnicity. Starting in 2020, displays of racism and their impacts have intensified, and the recent
volatile climate during the COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to assess mechanisms that link
discrimination and other social determinants of health with racial/ethnic disparities in drug use, but there has not
been the requisite science on this topic as it deserves. Existing research on the discrimination-substance use
association is plagued by both external validity (i.e., non-representative sampling with low generalizability to
overall U.S.) and internal validity (i.e., low temporal precision from annual inter-survey intervals to detect
prospective, potentially causal association). Additionally, there is little evidence to guide clinicians and
policymakers on interventions that can disrupt discrimination’s impact on substance use in the modern social,
economic, and public health context. This secondary analysis of the nationally-representative Understanding
America Study (UAS, n~9,000 U.S. adults) aims to elucidate the nature and mechanisms of the association of
discrimination with race/ethnicity inequalities in substance use. To chart the broad effects of the pandemic, this
study will harmonize longitudinally bi-weekly (March 2020-July 2021) and monthly (August/September 2021-
June 2022) survey waves with a total of 38 timepoints. Time-varying measures include 1) frequency of
discrimination experience, racism, and COVID-19 related discrimination, and 2) substance use (past-week use
of alcohol, cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cannabis, and other drugs, poly-substance use, and binge drinking) along
with key public health (e.g., COVID-19 illness and vaccination), economic (e.g., economic insecurity, housing
insecurity, and employment instability), and behavioral factors (e.g., resilience and coping strategies). We will
combine person-level data (38 survey waves) with state-level geocoded data on hate crime incidence, statutory
provisions, and other public health or economic context. Intensive longitudinal multi-level modeling will be
conducted to partition between- and within-subject variance and address between-person confounds, thus
overcoming the biases inherent in other annual-interval national substance use surveillance with low temporal
precision and recall errors. Through three inter-related aims and theory-driven hypothesis testing, we will 1)
examine whether within-person changes in discrimination are associated with substance use and if associations
are moderated by race and ethnicity (Aim 1), 2) determine person- and environment-level factors that exacerbate
or buffer against the association of discrimination with substance use (Aim 2), and 3) assess mechanisms that
explain race/ethnicity differences in the association of discrimination with substance use (Aim 3). Findings from
this study will provide timely evidence to guide clinicians and policymakers on interventions that can disrupt
discrimination’s impact on substance use in the modern social, economic, and public health context."
10908687,"Background: The timing of a skilled nursing facility (SNF) stay is met with significant psychological stress for both patients
and family care-partners (CPs), which can negatively impact recovery as well as long-term health and psychological
outcomes. These consequences may be magnified among socioeconomically disadvantaged patients (i.e., dual-eligible
beneficiaries) and their CPs, who experience multiple health disparities. Dyadic psychological interventions promote coping
skills to improve short-term distress and reduce the risk of chronic psychological symptoms for both patients and CPs, but
are untested in SNFs. To address this limitation and to progress the field toward improving psychological care in SNFs, I
will develop and pilot “Building Resilience In SKilled nursing facilities” (BRISK), a dyadic intervention designed to reduce
psychological distress among socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and CPs during a post-acute SNF stay. Specific
aims and research design: (1) iteratively develop BRISK with multi-level stakeholder input by conducting semi-structured
interviews with up to 20 patient-CP dyads and 4 focus groups with SNF clinical and leadership staff (NIH Model Stage 1a);
(2) refine and optimize BRISK by conducting a single-arm open pilot study with 5 patient-CP dyads and exit interviews
with 5 SNF staff (NIH Model Stage 1a); and (3) test the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of BRISK by conducting a
pilot cluster randomized controlled trial with patient-CP dyads completing BRISK (N=30 dyads) or minimally enhanced
usual care (N=20 dyads) in 3 SNFs (NIH Stage Model 1b). A diverse stakeholder advisory council will convene throughout
the award period to collaboratively guide intervention development and refinements to enhance the relevance and real-world
adoption potential of BRISK. Training: I have developed a rigorous training plan designed to support the research aims
and end goal of this proposal, as well as help me launch my career as an independent patient-oriented investigator with the
long-term career goal of improving psychological care for socioeconomically disadvantaged patients and families in SNFs.
The specific training goals are to: (1) develop skills in intervention development and optimization; (2) acquire skills for
clinical trials research, including statistical analysis, with dyads in SNFs; and (3) acquire skills for research with
socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults and families, with the goal of promoting health equity. The research
environments at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical as well as my multidisciplinary mentorship team
with distinct and complementary areas of expertise will help ensure the successful achievement of training goals. Impact:
I am a clinical geropsychologist with expertise in residential post-acute and long-term care settings. My ultimate mission is
to develop a feasible, scalable, and sustainable psychological intervention that improve care among dual-eligible patients
and their CPs receiving post-acute SNF care. The research and training goals outlined in this K23 proposal will provide the
foundation for future clinical trials to test the efficacy-effectiveness and, eventually, dissemination and implementation of
BRISK with socioeconomically disadvantaged patient-CP dyads receiving post-acute care in SNFs, a high-need and under-
studied population. This work is well aligned with NIA's goal of improving coping ability and reducing caregiver, family,
and patient stress (Strategic Goal C; Objective C-4) with a NIA priority population."
10741800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The brain regulates nociceptive processing through descending projections from the brainstem to the spinal
and trigeminal dorsal horns. This is accomplished through endogenous pain-modulating circuits that can
amplify or suppress pain-related signals, and normally maintain a balance between facilitation and inhibition of
pain. In chronic pain conditions, the system is dysregulated, contributing to a facilitated pain state. The output
of this pain-modulating system, via the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) has been extensively studied.
Bidirectional pain control from this region is mediated by two physiologically defined cell classes, “ON-cells”
and “OFF-cells,” that respectively facilitate and inhibit nociceptive transmission. However, sensory inputs to
RVM are only now receiving significant attention. Indirect inputs from the dorsal horn via the parabrachial
complex convey nociceptive information to RVM and contribute to the sensitization of RVM neurons in
persistent inflammatory pain. However, there also is evidence from anatomical studies for a direct input from
the dorsal horn to RVM. The hypothesis of this proposal is that RVM receives both indirect and direct functional
inputs from the trigeminal dorsal horn that contribute to pain-modulation, and that the direct input is altered in a
persistent pain state. This project will focus on the trigeminal system, which mediates sensory input from the
face and head, regions associated with a heavy burden of chronic pain, including migraine headache,
temporomandibular disorder, and trigeminal neuralgia. I will use a combination of single-cell recording in RVM
combined with optogenetic manipulation of the direct (trigeminal-to-RVM) and indirect (trigeminal relay through
parabrachial complex) projections to test the role of each connection to RVM and determine whether and how
the function of the direct pathway changes in persistent pain. Collectively, these studies will enhance our
understanding of the contribution of trigeminal sensory inputs to the intrinsic pain-modulatory circuit and define
how nociceptive inputs gain access to the RVM. By identifying the drivers of pro-nociceptive brainstem outputs,
we can gain new insights into how pain-modulating systems are recruited and modulated in acute and chronic
pain, providing us with novel targets for therapies. This project will complement a comprehensive and
structured training plan that I have developed in collaboration with my mentor, Dr. Mary Heinricher. In addition
to advanced training in optogenetics and in vivo electrophysiology, I will enhance my skills in programming,
experimental design, and quantitative analysis. I will also gain increased depth of understanding of pain and
pain research, in part by exposure to the clinical challenges of chronic pain management. Finally, I expect to
engage in activities that will support increased skills in scientific communication. As a whole, the proposed
training will position me to succeed as an independent researcher and leader in academic pain research."

 Title: Targeting FTO to treat acute myeloid leukemia
 Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a major form of leukemia with unfavorable prognosis. With
currently available therapies, over 70% of patients with AML cannot survival over five years. Thus, it is urgent to
develop more effective novel therapeutics. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most abundant internal
modification in eukaryotic messenger RNAs, and can be removed by m6A demethylases such as FTO. Recently,
we reported that, as an m6A demethylase, FTO plays a critical oncogenic role in AML pathogenesis and drug
response (Li Z., et al. Cancer Cell. 2017). Moreover, we showed that by suppression of the FTO/m6A signaling,
R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG) displays intrinsic and broad anti-leukemia effects (Su et al. Cell. 2018). Our
unpublished data suggests that FTO may also play a role in the self-renewal of leukemia stem/initiating cells
(LSCs/LICs). Thus, our results have shown the functional importance of FTO in AML pathogenesis and drug
response, and highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting FTO and the associated RNA epitranscriptome to
treat FTO-high AMLs, which account for >60% of total AML cases and are often associated with unfavorable
prognosis. More recently, we have identified a highly effective/selective small-molecule FTO inhibitor, namely
CS-1, which shows the highest anti-leukemia efficacy amongst a panel of 213 FTO inhibitor hits, with IC50 values
around 100 nM in suppression of viability of human AML cells (primary AML cells and cell line cells). Moreover,
we have also demonstrated that this compound binds directly to FTO protein and substantially prolongs survival
of AML mice in vivo. In addition, we also showed that this FTO inhibitor can substantially sensitize FTO-high
AML cells to other therapeutic agents.
 Objective/Hypothesis: Pharmacological inhibition of FTO with selective small molecule inhibitors alone or
in combination with other anti-leukemia therapeutics is an effective novel treatment approach in AML.
 Specific Aims: (1) To optimize CS-1 and develop clinically applicable effective and selective FTO inhibitors;
(2) To develop effective FTO inhibitor-based therapeutic strategies to treat unfavorable-risk FTO-high AMLs; and
(3) To decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-AML efficacy of the FTO inhibitor(s).
 Study Design: 1) We will develop more effective CS-1 analogs, and then assess and compare their FTO-
inhibition efficacy, selectivity, drug-like properties and therapeutic efficacy, and conduct PK/PD/toxicity studies
for the top 2 compounds (Aim 1). 2) We will further use murine AML and patient-derived xeno-transplantation
(PDX) AML models to assess the therapeutic efficacy of our top FTO inhibitor(s), alone or in combination with
other therapeutic agents, in treating unfavorable-risk FTO-high AMLs (Aim 2). 3) We will assess the effect of
genetic depletion or pharmaceutical inhibition of FTO on LSC/LIC self-renewal, and also decipher the molecular
mechanism by which FTO inhibition or FTO depletion displays potent anti-leukemia effects (Aim 3)."
10741805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacterial meningitis is the most common serious infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and a major
cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children. Although antibiotic therapy has changed
bacterial meningitis from a uniformly fatal disease to an often curable one, the overall outcome remains
unfavorable, with mortality of 5 to 10% and permanent neurologic sequelae occurring in 5 to 40% of survivors,
depending on patient age and pathogen. Disruption and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a
hallmark event in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis. Little is known, however, about the very first and
crucial interaction between a bacterial pathogen with the BBB that initiates this chain of events, and may
ultimately determine a poor or favorable neurological outcome in meningitis patients. This proposal seeks to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of BBB disruption during bacterial infection, and why it fails as a
neuroprotective barrier during bacterial meningitis. We have shown that bacterial infection induces an epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in endothelial cells (EndoMT), disrupting tight junctions in BBB
endothelium through the upregulation of host transcription factor Snail1, a global repressor of tight junctions.
Further, we have discovered that a bacterial adhesin interacts directly with vimentin, an intermediate filament
protein that is induced during EMT/EndoMT. I hypothesize that BBB disruption may be due to the combined
effect of bacterial entry and modulation of host signaling pathways that results in compromised barrier function.
Further that bacterial pathogens associated with CNS disease possess the unique ability to penetrate brain
endothelium, which ultimately leads to BBB dysfunction. These hypotheses will be addressed with both in vitro
and in vivo models of BBB penetration using Group B streptococcus (GBS) as a model human pathogen
associated with meningitis. AIM 1: Characterize the bacterial determinant(s) that initiate Snail1 activation and
the contribution of Snail1 to BBB breakdown during GBS meningitis; AIM 2: Characterize the host factors that
contribute to Snail1 activation during GBS infection; AIM 3: Determine the contribution of GBS-vimentin
interaction to BBB penetration and the development of meningitis. These studies should increase our
understanding of the bacterial and host factors involved in the interaction with brain endothelium that leads to

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype in which patients display extensive intratumor
genomic heterogeneity and frequently (50%) develop resistance to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) which
leads to metastatic disease and death. Due to the absence of hormonal receptors and targeted therapies,
TNBC patients with refractory disease are often left with limited treatment options. Currently, our understanding
of the genomic evolution of tumor cells and the role of the tumor microenvironment in chemoresistant disease
at primary and metastatic organ sites represents a major gap in knowledge that this proposal aims to address.
Our group has developed cutting-edge single cell DNA and RNA sequencing technologies that can overcome
previous technical barriers and limitations with `bulk' genomic methods for studying the genomic and
phenotypic evolution of tumor cells in response to chemotherapy. Our preliminary data in a small number of
TNBC patients suggests that genomic evolution of chemoresistance occurs through the adaptive selection of
pre-existing mutations and copy number alterations, which is followed by transcriptional reprogramming, to
achieve a chemoresistant phenotype (Kim et al. 2018, Cell). We further hypothesize that transcriptional
reprogramming of cell types in the tumor microenvironment occurs in chemoresistant disease and that
resistance programs are clonally inherited at distant metastatic organ sites. To comprehensively investigate
these questions in matched longitudinal samples from TNBC patients in a large neoadjuvant chemotherapy
trial (ARTEMIS), we propose three synergistic aims: Aim 1 will determine if copy number aberrations (CNAs)
and subclonal mutations associated with chemoresistance are pre-existing and adaptively selected in response
to therapy. Aim 2 will investigate if tumor cells and cell types in the microenvironment undergo transcriptional
reprogramming in refractory disease. Aim 3 will determine if subpopulations of resistant cells in the primary
tumor seed the metastatic lesions and confer resistance programs at distant organ sites. Completion of these
aims will define the genomic and evolutionary basis of chemoresistance in TNBC patients and will provide new
diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for overcoming chemoresistant disease, which is a critical unmet
clinical need. Our long-term goal is to translate single cell sequencing technologies into the clinic, where they
are poised to have a major impact on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer patients. The proposed
aims are directly aligned with the mission of NIH to reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life for breast
cancer patients."

Tendon injuries are challenging clinical problems due to slow, incomplete healing with fibrovascular scar
formation, which reduces tendon function and causes chronic complications such as pain and tendon ruptures.
The limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying fibrovascular scar formation is a significant
gap in knowledge, hindering the development of effective treatment modalities for tendon diseases.
Fibrovascular scar tissue is characterized by a disorganized extracellular matrix (ECM) with high cellularity and
neovascularization. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the key factors regulating tendon cells and
ECM maturation during tendon healing to develop regenerative medicine. Recent studies have demonstrated
that mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) signaling is a critical regulator for postnatal tendon
maturation and is associated with pathogenic tendon conditions such as fibrotic adhesion of flexor tendon, fatty
infiltration after rotator cuff tears, and human tendinopathy. However, the function of mTORC1 in fibrovascular
scar formation and its downstream molecular mechanisms are not known. Stat3 (signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3) is involved in fibrotic scar formation in multiple tissues and is known as a
downstream target of mTORC1 signaling in cancer cells. However, there is no reported evidence showing that
Stat3 mediates the function of mTORC1 in fibrovascular scar formation in tendons. Our overall objective is to
define the function of the mTORC1/Stat3 signaling cascade in fibrovascular scar formation and evaluate the
beneficial effects of mTORC1/Stat3 modulation on regenerative tendon healing. The central hypothesis of the
proposed research is that (i) injury-induced mTORC1 signaling governs fibrovascular scar formation during
tendon healing, and (ii) Stat3 mediates mTORC1 function in fibrovascular scar formation via regulation of ECM
organization. We will test the hypothesis using innovative multidisciplinary approaches, including mouse
genetics, a surgical injury model, advanced molecular/imaging analyses, and a biomechanical test. The goal of
Aim1 is to determine the function of mTORC1 in fibrovascular scar formation during tendon healing. The goal
of Aim2 is to define Stat3 as a mediator of mTORC1 function in fibrovascular scar formation in tendons. The
success of the proposed research will significantly advance the mechanistic understanding of fibrovascular
scar formation during tendon healing and provide a new platform to develop translational and clinical
researches targeting the mTORC1/Stat3 signaling cascade for the treatment of debilitating tendon diseases."

 My lab uses a community-based participatory research approach to reduce health disparities in
substance use among Black and Hispanic youth in urban communities. We primarily work in New Jersey (NJ)
due to our close ties with Paterson and East Orange, NJ which both have the highest number of substance use
disorders in the State and the largest group of racial-ethnic minorities (e.g. Black and Hispanic) in the state. My
lab intentionally works on the community level as we have found that one-size-fits all approaches to ending the
youth substance use epidemic will not work, particularly in communities that have been historically
marginalized. Our recent work has discovered that targeting individual level behaviors to promote behavior
change may not be enough to end the youth substance use epidemic and in fact, understanding the role of
neighborhood characteristics may be a more plausible strategy. In our work, we have shown that
predominantly urban communities such as Paterson, NJ and East Orange, NJ have some of the lowest
neighborhood resources associated with healthy youth development and therefore can contribute to likelihood
of using substances and becoming addicted. In addition, the use of complex statistical methods and study
designs, may contribute to lack of mistrust of researchers, participation in studies and of the data by
community members.
 We hypothesize that within predominantly urban communities, there is variability in structural risk and
asset-based neighborhood characteristics associated with youth substance use. In line with using a social
determinants of health approach, environmental and place-based factors have long been equated with health
outcomes such as respiratory conditions (e.g. asthma) among youth. However, determining the exact
resources within the community that contributes to substance use disorders have not been discovered. The
field of addiction does not know the exact characteristics within a neighborhood that can serve as either
protective or risk factors to substance use disorders within an urban community.
 In this Pioneer proposal which is responding to the RFA-DA-23-026, “NIDA Racial Equity Visionary
Award DP1 mechanism”, we will combine innovative approaches and multiple forms of data to investigate
neighborhood level factors by using participatory methods to co-create machine learning systems to predict
and prevent substance use disorders with community members. We intend for this project to promote co-
learning between community members and researchers that can lead to sustainable solutions for the
community. The proposed work will shed light on the importance of place in addiction and also work towards
eliminating racial bias in data sets and predictive algorithms by incorporating community members in all stages
of the model development process. Findings from this study have the potential to change the way we as
researchers conduct substance use and misuse prevention research and the way in which we formally engage
with community members. This work can contribute significantly to achieving health equity for Black and
Hispanic youth in urban communities."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) involving fentanyl is a major public health problem. OUD treatment with
buprenorphine reduces all-cause mortality and drug-related morbidity and can be started by licensed
prescribers in any outpatient or inpatient setting. For individuals using fentanyl, the process of starting
buprenorphine is increasingly complicated by precipitated withdrawal. Withdrawal during initiation of
buprenorphine deters some individuals from starting treatment and has been associated with treatment drop-
out and relapse among those who do start. The goal of this project is to test the preliminary efficacy, safety,
feasibility, and acceptability of a novel approach to initiating buprenorphine treatment for OUD that can be used
in outpatient setting without requiring or precipitating opioid withdrawal. We will recruit 60 subjects with
untreated OUD and recent fentanyl use through the University of Pennsylvania's Center for the Studies of
Addiction. Subjects will be randomized to one of two arms: standard initiation, in which subjects will start
buprenorphine after >8 hours of abstinence once they develop moderate opioid withdrawal with Clinical Opiate
Withdrawal Scale (COWS) at least 11; or a novel low-dose (“micro-dose”) approach, which is started with
COWS<4 and where buprenorphine doses are escalated over 10 hours, without ongoing use of full-agonist
opioids. We will compare success rates with each approach, with “success” defined as reaching a total-daily
dose of 8 mg buprenorphine without an increase of >6 in COWS from baseline and without early termination
for any reason. Findings from this study will be used to support an R01 application to test this novel approach
to initiating buprenorphine in real-world, outpatient settings with a larger sample of individuals with untreated
OUD. This methodology has broad applications for increasing access to office-based treatment for OUD."

Decades of research support the effectiveness of family-centered preventive interventions (FCPIs)in limiting
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk for children. Pediatric primary care offers the ideal delivery system in which
to embed effective FCPIs for CVD risk given goal alignment, parents’ trust in and longitudinal contact with
pediatricians, and reach into communities facing CVD disparities. Despite endorsement from the United States
Preventive Services Task Force, few FCPIs have been widely implemented in primary care, resulting in limited
access for families and public health impact. This application focuses on facilitating the widespread
implementation of the evidence-based Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health), a FCPI with demonstrated
positive effects on family and child health behaviors. To test the FCU4Health, we conducted an RCT with 240
primarily Mexican American and low-income families in partnership with multiple primary care systems. Children
were ≥5.5 to <13 years old and had elevated BMI (≥85th percentile for age and gender) at their most recent
primary care visit. Compared to usual care, FCU4Health significantly improved child and family health behaviors,
child social-emotional health, and resulted in meaningful change in child BMI at a magnitude consistent with
other interventions. Given this positive evidence, integrated primary care organizations have become
increasingly interested in its adoption. Our universal prevention trial with 217 primarily Mexican American and
low-income families with a 2- to 5-year-old child is currently underway in an integrated primary care system.
During these two trials, with guidance from the RE-AIM framework, and a Community Advisory Board that has
overseen FCU4Health development and testing, several implementation barriers were identified affecting its
reach, fidelity, and engagement. Technology-based implementation strategies (a clinical decision support tool,
automated fidelity monitoring, and an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrated SMS text messaging platform)
were developed to promote delivery at scale. In the proposed biphasic study, the R61 phase involves integration
of these strategies with the EHR and usability testing. In the R33 phase, a hybrid type 3 cluster randomized
factorial trial will be conducted with 150 coordinators and 1200 families to examine effects of the strategies on
fidelity and engagement (primary implementation outcomes) and child health behaviors (primary clinical
outcomes), family health routines, parenting skills, and child BMI. Prospective implementation cost analyses will
be performed to examine the economic impact and cost-effectiveness of each strategy. Finally, we will model
trajectories of child and family health behaviors and examine the associations with BMI at the 18-month follow-
up. The large sample size will allow us to examine these associations by baseline characteristics (BMI,
developmental stage, race/ethnicity, and gender). Results have the potential for a significant public health impact
on CVD risk by facilitating the scale-up of effective interventions for families in primary care settings."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating disease with enormous unmet medical need. It is likely necessary to
understand, detect, and treat Alzheimer’s Disease earlier in disease development. Patients often exhibit aberrant
neural activity even before pathology or cognitive decline. Amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau can perturb neural activity,
and activity can affect their levels, thus aberrant neural activity may be both a symptom and cause of Ab and
tau, forming a vicious cycle. This project will investigate the hypothesis that aberrant neural activity is a primary
driver of and tractable therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s Disease, and that targeting it can rescue cognitive
deficits. There is a lack of direct evidence on the causative role of aberrant neural activity in Alzheimer’s Disease,
let alone the mechanisms, a significant gap in our understanding. Human imaging methods have low resolution,
and human studies cannot use precise perturbations to test direct cause and effect. Yet, stimulation therapies
are used on patients, using limited data to inform protocols, resulting in promising but inconclusive results.
This
project will use cutting-edge systems neuroscience techniques to conduct single-cell resolution examination and
perturbation of the brain to determine the mechanistic role of aberrant neural activity in cognitive decline in
Alzheimer’s Disease mice, and to reverse it. To identify aberrant single-neuron and network dynamics, 2-photon
Ca2+ imaging will be used in Alzheimer’s Disease mice during cognitive tasks over disease progression. This will
be the first longitudinal study of single-neuron activity in Alzheimer’s Disease mice during cognitive tasks, and
the first lifelong study of neural activity. To discover activity-based anatomical connectivity changes, activity-
dependent neuron projection labeling will be used to label neurons activated during learning and recall. Tissue-
clearing will enable imaging of projections across the entire brain in 3D, along with Ab and tau, over disease
progression. This will discover specific brain regions, circuits, and cells that change in parallel to Ab and tau and
correlate with cognition. These will be the first brain-wide, activity-dependent projection tracing experiments, and
the first longitudinal study of anatomical connectivity changes in Alzheimer’s Disease. To test the functional role
of aberrant activity and to restore cognition, single-cell optogenetics will be used to recapitulate or reverse the
activity patterns changed in Alzheimer’s Disease, and circuits will be modulated to correct connectivity.
Optogenetics will be used in AD mice to determine if AD therapies improve cognition through effects on neural
activity. The investigator will receive technical, conceptual, and career development training from a mentoring
team of leading experts in world-class labs at Stanford University in preparation for transition to a faculty position.
This work will discover fundamental mechanisms of Alzheimer’s Disease. It will result in unprecedented, high-
resolution, comprehensive data on changes in neural activity and connectivity during Alzheimer’s Disease that
will identify the specific circuits, cells, and activity dynamics that drive cognitive decline, which will help inform
intelligent design of new, precise, and earlier biomarkers, diagnostic strategies, and therapeutic treatments."

This K08 application is for Dr. Jennifer McIntosh, an assistant professor of Maternal Fetal Medicine at the Medical
College of Wisconsin who is building her research niche as a physician-scientist studying mitochondrial
dysfunction within the human placenta as a mechanism for preeclampsia. This award would afford Dr. McIntosh
the time and resources that she needs to develop the research project and collaborative relationships. She has
established mentoring and consultative teams that include Dr. David Gutterman, an expert in human vascular
reactivity in the microcirculation, Dr. Hartmut Weiler, an expert in cellular and molecular mechanisms relating to
coagulation and placental development, Dr. Allen Cowley, an integrative physiologist internationally recognized
for his research in hypertension, and Dr. Nicole Lohr, an expert in vascular biology and experience with the
placental vasculature. Dr. McIntosh has also woven in experience with outside institutions to gain expertise in
cutting edge placental techniques as well as mitochondrial next generation sequencing to ensure she achieves
her career development goals and research aims. Preeclampsia remains a worldwide problem with over 10
million pregnant women impacted and over half a million perinatal lives lost annually. Preeclampsia is on the
rise, and the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of preeclampsia remains poorly understood. Vascular
dysfunction and endothelial damage within the placenta and maternal vasculature contribute to hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy. A novel relationship may exist between mitochondrial damage and endothelial
dysfunction and subsequent development of preeclampsia. The overall hypothesis is that with decreased
placental perfusion, ischemia results in increased reactive oxygen species, inflammation, and release of
mitochondrial DNA damage (mtDNA) that, via TLRs, promote a pro-oxidative and inflammatory environment in
the placental vasculature that result in endothelial dysfunction that culminates in preeclampsia. To investigate
this hypothesis, Dr. McIntosh will 1) determine whether placental hypoxia induces mtDNA damage using
placental samples within a hypoxic environment and 2) test whether heightened mtDNA damage in vessels from
preeclamptic placentas is responsible for impaired endothelial dependent dilation via toll-like receptors.
Videomicroscopy and wire myography will be used to test vasodilator capacity, flow mediated dilation (FMD),
and altered FMD as a result of heightened mtDNA in vessels from placentas in those with preeclampsia and
whether that could be reversed by inhibiting toll-like receptors. These studies may provide a mechanism that can
ultimately be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Through Dr. McIntosh’s proposed career development plan,
she will become an expert in the vascular biology of the human placental microcirculation and mitochondrial
dysfunction. These skills will position Dr. McIntosh to develop her R01 application and ultimately become a leader
in the field."

The twin epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continue to worsen, highlighting a growing
need to understand the dysregulation of appetite and insulin secretion that contribute to these diseases.
Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are key regulators of both appetite and insulin secretion. Thus, the long-term
goal of this project is to understand the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of EEC differentiation and
function, and how this is perturbed in disease states. The overall objective of this application is to identify and
evaluate factors that are necessary for EE differentiation and hormone production/secretion. The central
hypothesis is that EEC growth and function are controlled by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsically, we
have shown that FOXO1 inhibition (AS) and, separately, CB1/JNK inhibition (RSP) induce human EE
differentiation, but the mechanisms driving this are not known. Extrinsically, nutrients are known to regulate EE
hormone production, but it is unclear how other factors, including disease-related cytokines and hormones,
alter this response. The rationale for this proposal is that through a better understanding of EEC differentiation
and function, unique therapies can be developed to regulate appetite and insulin secretion via EE hormones.
The central hypothesis will be evaluated in two specific aims: 1) to identify the role of HES6 and LMX1B in
human EE differentiation and to identify the epigenetic and transcriptional changes driven by AS and RSP
during early EE differentiation; and 2) to evaluate the impact of cytokines and hormones on nutrient-stimulated
EEC function. In Aim 1, we will study gene expression changes (using CRISPR/Cas9, SHARE-seq), epigenetic
changes (using SHARE-seq, bulk ATAC-seq), and protein interactions (using co-immunoprecipitation) in
human duodenal organoids to investigate the roles of HES6 and LMX1B and to identify new factors involved in
early stages of EE differentiation. In Aim 2, we will assess the ability of EECs (derived from duodenal and
rectal organoids) to recapitulate the response of native EECs to nutrient stimulation. We will assess hormone
production and secretion (using ELISA, qPCR), and how these responses are dysregulated following exposure
to obesity/T2DM-associated cytokines and hormones. The candidate for this K08 proposal is Daniel Zeve, MD,
PhD, a pediatric endocrinologist with expertise in developmental biology and metabolism. With his mentor, Dr.
David Breault, Dr. Zeve has designed a career development plan to achieve scientific independence. This plan
will be performed at Boston Children’s Hospital, allowing the applicant access to a multitude of resources
throughout the Harvard Medical system. During the award period, the applicant will gain additional experience
in SHARE-seq, epigenetics, CRISPR/Cas9, and bioinformatics through multiple avenues, including
coursework, seminars, and high-level collaborations. This innovative project, which seeks to unravel the
regulation of EEC differentiation and function, will highlight potential novel therapeutic targets for obesity and
T2DM, and provide a strong foundation for Dr. Zeve’s scientific independence and future R01 submissions."

The following proposal is submitted by Dr. Peng Xia, PhD, in response to PA-20-190. Dr. Xia is currently a NIH
T32 fellow in the Massachusetts General Hospital Cardiovascular Research Center (MGH CVRC). Since his
initial K01 submission, he has been promoted to Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS). Here,
Dr. Xia proposes a comprehensive 5-year program of career development and mentored research to achieve
his long-term career goals of 1) becoming an independent investigator in cardiovascular aging biology and 2)
developing novel therapeutics for older adults with cardiovascular disease. To accomplish these goals, Dr. Xia
will be primarily mentored by Dr. Paul Yu, MD, PhD, Director of the MGH CVRC and an internationally-recognized
expert in vascular and Activin biology. Dr. Xia will also be co-mentored by Dr. Jason Roh, MD, MHS (NIA Beeson
scholar, Cardiac aging expert) and Dr. Aaron Aguirre, MD, PhD (advanced imaging expert). His training will be
supplemented by a Scientific Advisory Committee, including Drs. Jennifer Ho, MD, Ariela Orkaby, MD, MPH,
and Anthony Rosenzweig, MD, who will provide complementary expertise in cardiac aging, heart failure, and
frailty biology. Dr. Xia will conduct his research in the world class scientific environments of the MGH CVRC and
HMS, and will actively engage in the rich local and national aging research communities outlined in his training
plan. The plan has been specifically designed to advance Dr. Xia’s knowledge base and scientific skills in this
new area of investigation for him, and foster his development as a future leader in cardiovascular aging science.
Dr. Xia has generated most of the preliminary data that provides the foundation for this innovative proposal. Here,
he seeks to investigate a potential causal role of endothelial Activin type II receptor (ActRII) signaling in age-
related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). His overarching hypothesis is that pathological
aging upregulates endothelial ActRII signaling, which induces the hallmark cardiac microvascular rarefaction and
inflammatory phenotypes observed in HFpEF. This work has high translational potential with ActRII inhibitors
being FDA-approved for other clinical indications. The significance of this work is also highlighted by 1) HFpEF
being a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, and 2) the limited therapeutic options for this
prevalent geriatric HF syndrome. In this proposal, Dr. Xia will rigorously study the functional role of endothelial
ActRII signaling in age-related HFpEF in 3 aims. Aim 1 is designed to determine if age-associated endothelial
ActRII activation contributes to cardiac dysfunction in HFpEF; Aim 2 will utilize advanced imaging methods to
determine if endothelial ActRII activation induces microvascular rarefaction and inflammation; and Aim 3 will
elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying endothelial cell ActRII signaling in age-related HFpEF
pathophysiology. Completion of the proposed career and research plans will position Dr. Xia to successfully
compete for NIA R01 funding and become an independent investigator in cardiovascular aging biology research."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are strongly linked to modifiable lifestyle factors, e.g., physical
activity, alcohol intake, and diet. Importantly, adherence to health behavior recommendations (HBR) after CRC
diagnosis improves physical function, quality of life, and is consistently associated with longer survival.
However, <10% of CRC survivors adhere to health behavior recommendations (HBR) after diagnosis.
Addressing low adherence to HBR in CRC survivors is therefore a clinically relevant unmet need. Low
adherence to HBRs stems from a dearth of personally-tailored guidance about how to manage complex health
behavior change. Personalized self-management training can remedy this issue by teaching CRC survivors the
skills required to integrate health behavior recommendations into their unique life contexts. In non-cancer
populations such as diabetes and spinal cord injury, personalized self-management training programs have
been associated with increased adherence to health behavior recommendations when compared to
standardized interventions. To date, a personalized approach to lifestyle self-management has not yet been
tested in a cancer population. With strong evidence that post-diagnosis healthy lifestyle factors improve patient
outcomes, CRC is an important population in which to study the impact of self-management training on HBR
This five-year mentored research program for Dr. Alix Sleight aims to examine the effect of a personalized self-
management training program on the uptake of HBRs in CRC survivors. A total of 120 stage I-III CRC patients
diagnosed within 12 months will be recruited from the Cedars-Sinai Cancer Center and assessed using the
standardized World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Health
Behavior Adherence Scale. Patients with a WCRF/AICR score indicating low HBR adherence will be enrolled
and randomized to: 1) a personalized self-management intervention with a focus on health behaviors or 2) a
standardized health behavior education program. Each patient in the intervention group will receive content
tailored to their unique areas of low HBR adherence on the WCRF/AIRC Scale. Our pilot study (n=30)
demonstrated that a personalized self-management training intervention is feasible to implement, acceptable to
cancer survivors, and has potential to impact adherence to HBR. We therefore expect that a larger systematic
assessment of this intervention will show significant and clinically meaningful change in adherence to HBR.
The proposed career development program was designed to expand Dr. Sleight’s skillset in 1) behavioral
clinical trials, 2) biostatistics, and 3) implementation science. The training plan includes workshops and formal
coursework alongside guidance from a network of diverse mentors. Together with a supportive institutional
environment, this mentored research program will equip Dr. Sleight with the skills needed to develop and
conduct large-scale randomized controlled trials of personalized self-management interventions for HBR
adherence."
10913597,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer’s disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and aging has
emerged as one of the major public health challenges of our time. Recent clinical studies, as well as those in animal
models, support that preservation of cognitive health depends on an adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) supply to
the active brain regions. Importantly, in the healthy, young brain cerebral blood supply is readily adjusted to meet the
increased oxygen and nutrient demand of activated neurons. This homeostatic mechanism, termed ""neurovascular
coupling"" (NVC) or ""functional hyperemia"", is required for normal brain function. Preclinical and clinical evidence
shows that aging per se significantly impairs endothelium mediated NVC responses, which play a causal role in age-
related vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) and the development of ADRD.
 Lifestyle factors, including nutrition and dietary habits, significantly affect cerebrovascular health and, thereby,
influence the pathogenesis of age-related cognitive impairment and ADRD. Caloric restriction (CR), which exerts
multifaceted anti-aging and lifespan-extending effects, has been demonstrated to be an effective nutritional
intervention that can improve vascular health and cognitive function. CR activates SIRT1-dependent pathways in the
vasculature, which attenuates cellular oxidative stress and rescues endothelial vasodilation. However, adherence to
CR remains a challenge and a translational barrier as most humans may not be able, or willing, to reduce their caloric
intake by 30% over extended periods of time. Intermittent fasting can recapitulate the benefits of CR without limiting
calorie intake in older adults. Time restricted eating (TRE) is considered the best approach to intermittent fasting for
elderly individuals as it allows consumption of required calories within a condensed daily eating window (4-10 hours),
resulting in the greatest fasting stimulus without a net reduction in calorie intake. Yet, the impact of TRE on
cerebrovascular function and, potentially the delay of ADRD and age-related VCI, to preserve cognition is currently
unknown.
 Our central hypothesis is that closer adherence to TRE will improve NVC responses and micro- and
macrovascular endothelial function, potentially through activation of SIRT1-dependent vasoprotective pathways,
resulting in the improvement of cognitive performance. This hypothesis will be tested by assessing the effects of
TRE (10 hours eating window) in community dwelling older adults (55-80 years of age) in a 6-month study. Aim 1 will
determine the impact of TRE on NVC responses using innovative technologies such as functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS) and dynamic retinal vessel analysis (DVA), and on microvascular endothelial function using
laser speckle contrast imaging and flow-mediated dilation approaches in community dwelling older adults. Aim 2 will
determine the impact of TRE on circulating biomarkers and cerebromicrovascular endothelial cell SIRT1 activity."

Ultrastructural molecular/sub-molecular level aging-induced degradation in cellular assemblies makes them dys-
functional leading to cellular dysfunction that causes and exacerbates the aging-related problems. However, no
investigation has been carried out to explore such degradations due to the lack of imaging modalities that are sen-
sitive enough to capture the sub-molecular level features inside the cells in situ. One such assembly is the Nuclear
Pore complex which creates a conduit in the nuclear membrane essential for cytoplasm-nucleoplasm trafficking,
chromatin silencing, transcriptional control, and other vital cellular processes. NPC is a highly dynamic assembly
formed of extremely long-lived aging-affected proteins, whose composition, structure, and function deteriorate with
aging. This deterioration then negatively impacts their critical cellular functions, causing a decay in the health
and function of the cells, which is especially relevant for non-dividing, non-rejuvenating, and aging-prone cells
like neurons, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration. Cryo-focused ion beam milling and electron tomography
(cryo-FIB-ET) imaging is a novel and emerging imaging modality that allows us to peek into the cells at the
sub-molecular level, enabling in situ structural biology. Complementing cryo-FIB-ET imaging, single-molecule
imaging can be used to explore the identification of the building blocks of massive cellular assemblies and also
the molecular mechanism of its assembly. Using cryo-FIB-ET, Dr. Singh recently identified the in situ
architecture of the NPC (Cell (2022)). He has also contributed to the development and application of
cryo-FIB-ET imaging with contributions to 4 publications in his postdoc. During Ph.D., Dr. Singh trained in
single-molecule imaging to study the molecular mechanism of CRISPR enzymes and T4-bacteriophage motor with
11 publications, including 6 as first/co-first. By leveraging his dual expertise in cryo-FIB-ET and single-molecule
imaging and a broad collaboration effort within UCSD, around UCSD and with his collaborator and co-mentor at
Rockfeller, Dr. Singh will determine:
• The structures and isoforms of aged NPCs to map its aging-accumulated degradations (K99 phase).
• Aging-induced changes in composition of NPC and its building blocks (K99 to R00 transition).
• The assembly process of the NPC to understand how aging affects it (R00 phase).
Dr. Singh will receive the needed training under the mentorship of Drs. Elizabeth Villa and Michael Rout.
These mentors have demonstrated excellence in research leadership and have trained multiple trainees who have
transitioned to independent fulfilling careers in sciences. In addition, an excellent team of collaborators and
advisory committee (Drs. Andrej Sali, Nan Hao, Elizabeth Villa, Michael Rout) has been assembled to assist Dr.
Singh’s research and provide additional training and career support through the K99-R00 phase. The R00 Award
phase will set the foundation for Dr. Singh’s long-term career goals of establishing a rigorous research program
that seeks to merge two powerful imaging modalities to understand the cellular level changes caused by aging at
the molecular level."

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a promising tool for the prevention of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and
the postpartum period and is a recommended component of a comprehensive package of prevention of mother-
to-child HIV transmission services. Yet, few strategies exist to promote person-centered shared decision-making
about PrEP use during pregnancy and breastfeeding despite the complexity of this decision and the importance
of shared decision-making for medication adherence. The proposed training and research plan in this Mentored
Research Scientist Development Award (K01) application will provide the essential training and skills that the
principle investigator, Dr. Lauren M. Hill, PhD, needs to launch a productive career in PrEP decision-making
research and in the development and evaluation of behavioral interventions to promote the utilization of and
adherence to medicines for the prevention and treatment of HIV. Further, the research conducted throughout
the course of this award would contribute meaningfully to the successful delivery of PrEP in the context of
antenatal care in sub-Saharan Africa to ensure that decision-making regarding PrEP use by pregnant and
breastfeeding women is person-centered to encourage appropriate and adherent use. To achieve this, Dr. Hill
proposes three aims: First, she will identify values important to women’s decision-making about PrEP use during
pregnancy and breastfeeding through a mixed methods formative study. Second, using this information and the
results of a comprehensive needs assessment with pregnant women, their partners, and antenatal health care
workers, she will develop a PrEP shared decision-making aid. Third, she will conduct a pilot trial to evaluate the
effect of the shared decision-making intervention on the proximal cognitive endpoint of decisional conflict and
explore the treatment effect on PrEP adherence. The training acquired by Dr. Hill through this timely study, in
combination with didactic coursework, applied training, and mentorship will target the four training objectives: 1)
to build expertise in medical decision-making with a focus on the development and evaluation of shared decision-
making interventions; 2) to gain training in methods for the design, management, and analysis of trials to evaluate
clinical interventions supporting the use of biomedical HIV prevention methods; 3) to master skills in the design
of mixed methods studies and integration of mixed methods data for intervention design and evaluation; and 4)
to develop the professional skills, expertise, and pilot data to facilitate her development toward research
independence. Dr. Hill proposes to achieve these goals through a rigorous program of training and research to
build upon and complement her training and experience in behavioral research for the primary prevention of HIV

diagnosed cancer worldwide, as well as the second most frequent cause of cancer death. Furthermore, the liver
is also the most common site for metastatic cancer. Most patients with advanced disease are offered only non-
surgical palliative treatment options. Hepatic tumors derived their blood supply from the hepatic artery whereas
normal liver tissue’s blood supply is mainly sourced from the portal vein. Intra-arterial therapies, such as
chemoembolization and radioembolization, exploit the hepatic tumors’ blood supply via the hepatic artery to
selectively deliver contrast and therapies. Lipiodol is an FDA approved radio-opaque contrast agent used in liver
tumor imaging during intra-arterial therapies. Lipiodol accumulates and remains in the tumor while clearing out
of normal liver tissue when injected via the hepatic artery, providing a vehicle to deliver therapeutic agents, such
as, chemotherapeutics and -emitting radionuclides (188Re and 131I) to liver tumors, but these treatments have
limitations, urging the need for development of new therapies. Alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy
(RPT) is highly potent, causing largely irreparable DNA damage to targeted cells. Due to the short range of
alpha particles, RPT minimizes damage to nearby healthy cells. The high-energy transfer of alpha particles
makes RPT impervious to most resistance mechanisms including pathway redundancy and oxygenation status,
a desirable feature for treatment of liver tumors. Lipiodol has detailed information on its pharmacology,
formulation and toxicity, due to its FDA-approved status, and its repurposing for RPT can build upon information
from previous studies for FDA approval to help rapidly translate a novel RPT agent-Lipiodol emulsion to the
clinic. The proposed work is focused on evaluating targeted RPT emulsions for unresectable primary liver
cancer as compared to standard of care treatment (Aim 1). A selected RPT emulsion will be tested in a technical
rabbit VX2 liver cancer model, allowing us to evaluate these agents’ distribution via the hepatic artery (Aim 2).
Finally, the proposed work is focused on the development of a companion imaging agent or the expansion of
imaging protocols to allow for a single theranostic agent (Aims 1-3). The successful completion of the proposed
research is that an RPT agent-Lipiodol emulsion, based on current FDA approved Lipiodol emulsions, can be
repurposed for quick development and evaluation as a therapeutic or theranostic agent for primary and
metastatic liver cancer."
10744757,"SUMMARY
A large proportion of the excess CVD morbidity and mortality experienced by individuals with T1D occur in
conjunction with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is associated with a striking increase in the risk of
coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. The latter is frequently due to the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy – a diabetes-specific alteration of the myocardium. The etiologic links between DKD and
cardiomyopathy are not clear, but preliminary data from our group suggest a pivotal role of the kidney function
decline component of DKD rather than albuminuria. Specifically, using an MRI-derived marker of
cardiomyocyte size, we have observed that patients with T1D who are losing kidney function but still have
preserved GFR have subclinical signs of myocardial remodeling, as indicated by a larger cardiomyocyte
size and a reduction of myocardial fiber shortening during systole as compared to T1D patients with
stable kidney function. The overall goal of this collaborative proposal, which is in response to RFA-HL-21-014,
is to take advantage of the latest developments in cardiac imaging and biomarker platforms to characterize the
cardiac involvement in patients with T1D and DKD, focusing on the initial events in the development of diabetic
cardiomyopathy. “GFR Decliners” (GFR loss in the previous 3-6 years ≥3 ml/min/year, n=100) and “GFR Non-
Decliners” (n=100) with T1D and CKD stage 1-3A, along with Non-diabetic controls (n=100) of similar age and
CKD stage, will undergo a gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and a gated cardiac CT
scan to quantify coronary artery calcium (CAC). Through these studies, we will address the following Specific
Aims: 1. To evaluate the presence and severity of myocardial remodeling among T1D patients and
assess its relationship with early progressive kidney function decline. Cardiomyocyte size (τic) and
interstitial fibrosis (measured as extracellular volume [ECV]) will be quantified by CMR and compared among
GFR Decliners, GFR Non-Decliners, and Non-Diabetic subjects, and also related to albuminuria and presence
and severity of CAD. 2. To assess the relative contribution of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial
fibrosis to impaired cardiac function among T1D patients. Indices of cardiac function and myocardial strain
will be derived from the CMR data and evaluated for their association with cardiomyocyte size (τic) and
interstitial fibrosis (ECV), in relation to the severity of concomitant CAD. 3. To gain insights into the disease
processes involved in the etiology of myocardial remodeling and assess whether these overlap with
those involved in the progressive kidney function decline. In targeted studies, we will focus on serum
proteins implicated in heart failure or previously associated with increased risk of GFR loss. In untargeted
studies, we will leverage the latest developments in multiplexed assays to evaluate serum protein profiles in a
systematic fashion. With the information generated by this study on hand, we will be optimally positioned to
develop new strategies and possibly new drugs to prevent CVD in T1D."
10897017,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an intractable neurodegenerative disorder that devastates approximately 6.2 million Americans nationwide. Emerging evidence now establishes a central role for microglia in AD pathogenesis and reveals that transcriptional and epigenetic level changes in these cells tightly correlate with disease progression. Thus, targeting microglia with selective pharmacologic agents to control their cellular activity represents a powerful therapeutic avenue. However, precise microglia targeting requires broad knowledge of how the cell-surface proteome, or surfaceome, remodels in the disease environment, and this biology has not been systematically explored. I performed mass spectrometry-based surfaceome profiling of microglia after exposure to Aβ fibrils. My data revealed a robust upregulation of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and proteins that promote phagocytosis. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will directly test if Aβ-induced heparan sulfate proteoglycans result in increased tau phagocytosis and seeding in human iPSC microglia. This hypothesis represents a unique framework that mechanistically links Aβ and tau pathology through microglia phagocytosis. In Aim 2, I will determine the tissue expression patterns of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in human AD brain. Finally, in Aim 3, I will engineer novel cell-surface degrading antibodies, called KineTACs, to specifically degrade disease-associated microglia targets from the cell-surface. The work outlined within this proposal is innovative and will greatly increase our understanding of microglia phagocytosis in AD and provide new recombinant tools to modulate this process. With the strong support of my scientific mentors and advisors at the University of California San Francisco, this K08 training proposal will enable me to cultivate mastery in iPSC cell culture models, human immunohistochemistry, and recombinant antibody engineering. This trajectory constitutes the first steps toward a broader career goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration."
10881927,"ABSTRACT
Cells must integrate competing DNA repair pathways and tightly control their chromatin landscapes to
maintain genomic integrity. Disruption of these control systems or defects in any one pathway result in a
mutational burden with profound physiological consequences to cells and tissues. DNA repair in human
cells is primarily performed by two mutually exclusive pathways governed by two different, well-
characterized tumor suppressors – non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) by 53BP1 and homologous
recombination (HR) by BRCA1. 53BP1 and BRCA1 are examples of intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) containing large stretches of low complexity amino acid sequences. 53BP1 undergoes liquid-liquid
phase separation to form biomolecular condensates in vitro and at DNA lesions. Further, recent studies
hint that 53BP1 condensation also plays a major role in maintaining chromatin organization. Whether
BRCA1 has similar phase separation activity has not been established. In preliminary data, I show the
very first evidence that BRCA1 phase separates to form biomolecular in cells and in vitro.
Chromatin landscapes also play a vital role in maintaining genomic integrity. DNA damage response
requires dynamic rearrangements and specific chromatin modifications to elicit rapid recruitment of repair
factors. Conversely, repair factors and their complexes can also modify chromatin to drive repair
programs. Despite extensive study of 53BP1 and BRCA1 tumor suppressor activities and their repair
mechanisms, it remains unknown by what mechanism 53BP1 or BRCA1 condense and what role
condensations plays in DNA damage response. Further, the contributions of chromatin architecture to
repair pathway selection and chromatin organization within repair condensates have not been elucidated.
The goal of this work is to provide me with new training and expertise to address the proposed aims and
establish an independent research program. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will identify the specific sequence
determinants that promote 53BP1 and BRCA1 phase separation and determine the contribution of protein
condensates to promoting DNA repair and fidelity in repair pathway selectivity (NHEJ vs. HR). I will test
the hypothesis that the magnitude of tumor suppressor condensation contributes to pathway selection.
In Aim 2 (K99/R00 phase), I will define the dynamic rearrangement of chromatin in response to DNA
damage and how nucleosome clustering and DNA loop compaction contribute to chromatin dynamics in
53BP1- and BRCA1-mediated repair programs. Collectively, this work will address fundamental gaps in
knowledge regarding the role of phase separations in genome integrity and uncover new paradigms that
underlie tumor suppressor activities."

 2 Candidate: Jennifer Kusma, MD, MS is a pediatrician and junior clinical investigator focused on improving the
 3 evidence-base for the health care policy and access for children with special health care needs (CSHCN). Dr.
 4 Kusma’s long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-investigator who works in cross-
 5 disciplinary teams to evaluate evidence-based health care policy and delivery, with a focus on delivery of
 6 immunoprophylaxis against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for infants at high-risk for morbidity and mortality,
 7 with a focus on infants with congenital heart disease (CHD).
 8 Research Context/Objective: RSV infection is incredibly prevalent, almost all children will contract RSV within
 9 the first two years of life. RSV contributes to significant morbidity and mortality for specific populations of
10 CSHCN including CHD, chronic lung disease of prematurity, and premature infants, which is costly, so an
11 immunoprophylactic (IP) treatment is available. However, only 33% of eligible infants receive their complete
12 RSV IP. Therefore, the objective of this award is for Dr. Kusma to learn how to assess the factors associated
13 with receipt of complete RSV IP, ethically evaluate tradeoffs in RSV IP policy, and prioritize barriers and
14 facilitators to implementation of RSV IP policy.
15 Specific Aims: 1) To identify patient, provider, and institutional level factors associated with receipt of
16 complete RSV IP (5 doses within the 6-month RSV season) guided by the CFIR model. 2) To determine ethical
17 tradeoffs of potential RSV IP practices and policies, applying an ethical framework for infants with CHD as
18 compared with other IP-eligible infants. 3) To evaluate determinants of suboptimal implementation of RSV IP
19 practices and policies informed by the CFIR model.
20 Research Plan: Dr. Kusma will retrospectively analyze existing patient, provider, institution, and insurance
21 level factors associated with complete receipt of RSV IP using data from PEDSnet, a Learning Health System,
22 guided by the CFIR model (Aim 1); evaluate ethical tradeoffs of key stake holders regarding RSV IP policy
23 (Aim 2); and apply mixed methods to prioritize barriers and facilitators of implementation of RSV IP (Aim 3).
24 Career Development Plan/Environment: Through local and national courses, experiential learning,
25 workshops, seminars, and professional activities, Dr. Kusma will acquire expertise in evaluating hierarchical
26 modeling, learning health systems, ethical evaluation, mixed methods analysis, and implementation science.
27 Dr. Kusma will strengthen her professional skills needed for an independent physician-investigator career
28 through close mentorship by an experienced, complementary team of NIH-funded team mentors and advisors.
29 Northwestern University and Lurie Children’s Hospital will provide outstanding research infrastructures to
30 enable a successful award and are strongly committed to Dr. Kusma’s transition to research independence."
10741804,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Perivascular spaces (PVSs) are fluid-filled spaces surrounding vessels of the central nervous system,
are thought to have important roles in maintenance of brain health, and are a unique niche for a variety of
perivascular cell types. A cell type of particular interest is perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs) which are poorly
characterized, and their functions are largely unknown. PVFs are known to reside on the outside the vascular
smooth muscle layer of medium-to large-diameter vessels in the adult mouse central nervous system, and are
primarily identified by expression of Collagen-1 and Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)a and
PDGFRb. However, nearly nothing is known about the developmental origins, or the cellular and molecular
mechanisms important for PVF development. Preliminary data suggests PVFs emerge from a population of cells
in the meninges and gradually populate brain PVSs during postnatal development, but this has not yet been
investigated further. These gap in knowledge is a major barrier to developing novel tools to investigate the role
of PVFs in brain homeostasis and disease. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the developmental
origins, cellular dynamics, and molecular signaling mechanisms involved in PVF development. In Aim 1, I will
use a combination of transgenic mouse lines that label PVFs, optical tissue clearing, ex vivo imaging, and a
multi-color lineage tracing reporter to investigate the cellular origins and dynamics of developing PVFs. In Aim
2, I will use intracisternal cerebrospinal fluid tracer assays to determine the relationship between the timing of
PVF development and PVS function. Finally, in Aim 3 I will investigate PDGF signaling as a potential mechanism
controlling PVF development. Together, this project will be the first to fully characterize how PVF development
occurs and whether or not PDGF signaling is involved."
10912024,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The widespread sequencing of healthy babies is imminent: at least a dozen research projects have recently
launched, and several companies offer newborn genetic screening panels. A newborn’s genome can contain
health information of relevance across their lifespan — as a baby, later in childhood, and in adulthood. This
poses a timing issue: if babies are sequenced near birth, when should this information be revealed? A
proposed vision for the future of genomic medicine is to reveal information as it becomes relevant, to the
child’s parents and later, if desired, to the individual. This would necessitate the genome being kept “on file,” to
be used as a resource over time. This strategy may promote the ethical rollout of lifelong genomic medicine by
promoting the developing child’s autonomy and optimizing the balance of benefits to risks. However, the
feasibility of this strategy, the details of its implementation, and its implications have yet to be explored in a
rigorous and empirical manner. Perhaps other approaches are preferable. A second, simplified, strategy would
reveal all childhood-relevant information at birth and then give the individual the option of receiving adult-onset
information at age 18. A third strategy would reject using the genome as a resource over time, and just
generate one report for a baby, potentially including adult-onset information. This strategy may be preferable
because the use of the genome as a resource raises complex ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI),
including data control, privacy, consent, legal obligations, and decision making about when information
becomes relevant. For these different strategies, this project will 1) Determine their feasibility, 2) Assess their
ELSI, 3) Understand the preferences of parents from diverse backgrounds, and 4) Develop consensus on the
necessary and desirable features for a strategy to sequence babies near birth, possibly using the genome as a
resource over time. The project will have impact by producing concrete, evidence-based and ethically framed
recommendations for implementers of newborn sequencing. The candidate was originally trained as a
computational biologist, was formerly employed in the genomics industry, and is currently an ELSI scholar. Her
goal is to become an independent investigator working in the context of clinical research informing the adoption
of genomic medicine to identify, assess and address ELSI questions, ultimately to ensure that genomic
medicine works to the benefit of all. To accomplish this goal, this proposal focuses her training efforts on a)
developing skills in conducting surveys, b) developing expertise in Delphi methods, and c) refining skills in
conceptual and normative analysis. The project will leverage the BabySeq cohorts, the world’s first empirical
studies of comprehensive genomic sequencing in healthy newborns, directed by members of her mentorship
team. The proposed training will make the candidate a well-rounded ELSI researcher able to deploy mixed
methodologies while leveraging her technical background, preparing her to contribute to NHGRI’s goal of
developing and assessing strategies for implementing the use of genomic information at the population level."
10898018,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is the second most common form of degenerative dementia, affecting at least 2.4
million people in the US, and the overwhelming majority of persons living with LBD (PLBD) are cared for by
family caregivers. LBD caregiver strain: 1) exceeds that of non-LBD dementia caregivers; 2) worsens caregiver
physical and mental health; and 3) independently increases the risk of PLBD hospitalization and
institutionalization. LBD progression is complicated by the synergistic effects of motor, cognitive, and
neuropsychiatric decline, and is punctuated by falls, infections, dehydration, and neuropsychiatric symptoms
leading to acute healthcare utilization. Although family caregivers are uniquely positioned to identify and manage
these challenges, which may avert emergency department visits and reduce morbidity, many caregivers lack the
knowledge, skills, confidence, resources, and support to do so. NIA recognizes the gap in enhancing the
knowledge and skills of dementia caregivers and the critical need to understand optimal intervention structure,
content, mechanisms, and delivery methods for caregiver interventions. Building on our team’s recruitment
successes and prior work impacting caregiver strain and PLBD quality of life, the proposed study addresses
these gaps using our successfully piloted, peer mentor-delivered educational intervention for LBD caregivers
(PERSEVERE). The study aims to 1) quantify the impact of PERSEVERE on caregiver knowledge, attitudes,
mastery, and strain; 2) identify the intervention and mentor factors determining implementation fidelity; and 3)
test the effects of PERSEVERE on PLBD quality of life and healthcare utilization. These aims will be
accomplished in an NIH Behavioral Model Stage II (efficacy) national, randomized, attention-controlled, 12-week
trial of PERSEVERE in 502 LBD caregivers in partnership with the Lewy Body Dementia Association,
Parkinson’s Foundation, Davis Phinney Foundation, and LBD Caregiver Advisors. We will match caregivers in
the intervention arm with a trained peer mentor who will coach them through a modular, practical, theory-based
curriculum covering LBD knowledge and social support topics. Caregivers in the attention control condition will
receive weekly, curated links to educational materials only. We will identify immediate and delayed intervention
effects, including mediators of caregiver strain at twelve weeks, and caregiver strain and PLBD outcomes at nine
months. PLBD healthcare utilization and implementation fidelity will be assessed biweekly. Focus groups with
mentors and interviews with mentees will further define the intervention- and mentor-specific factors predicting
fidelity, mentee outcomes, and retention. Remote recruitment, mentoring, and assessments incorporate
community engagement strategies to ensure maximum accessibility and inclusion of underrepresented caregiver
groups. Study results will illuminate the extent to which leveraging prior LBD caregivers as expert interventionists
can improve current caregiver outcomes, and in turn, PLBD outcomes. These results will inform future adaptation
and dissemination of this model for other dementia caregivers."

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability and a risk factor for later development of
Alzheimer's Disease (AD.) This project focuses on brain cerebrospinal/interstitial fluid systems essential for
clearing the brain of waste and toxins, including the glymphatic system, as important to the pathophysiology of
both TBI and AD. We will use neuroimaging to measure brain fluid clearance after TBI. Our preliminary
results suggest that TBI causes significant reduction in clearance. In this project, we will confirm these results
using additional clearance measurement methods, and determine if lower post-injury clearance is associated
with worse cognitive, functional and symptomatic recovery from TBI.
We will also use neuroimaging (Positron Emission Tomography - PET) to measure brain amyloid-β (Aβ) – a
hallmark pathologic feature of AD – as soon as possible after TBI. Studies in animals and our preliminary data
in humans indicate that Aβ is released after TBI and deposits rapidly in the brain, but after a variable period of
time, is usually no longer present. We hypothesize that the rate of brain fluid clearance will predict the change
in brain Aβ over one year after TBI. Poor clearance and persistent Aβ may explain (in part) why TBI is a risk
factor for AD. In addition, monitoring these processes after TBI will provide information relevant to
understanding AD in general, since this same pathophysiology – poor clearance leading to Aβ deposition –
occurs in AD, but slowly over decades, making it more difficult to study.
We will conduct a five year longitudinal study which will recruit subjects within hours after moderate or
complex-mild TBI from a network of busy NYC emergency rooms. Neuroimaging, blood draw for TBI
biomarkers and detailed cognitive/clinical assessment will be performed as soon as possible (<14 days) after
injury and repeated at one year. Because there is no current gold standard for measuring brain fluid clearance
in humans, we use a panel of complementary PET and MRI neuroimaging methods to estimate fluid flow,
mixing and clearance through interconnected fluid-filled spaces in the brain. This includes a PET method we
developed that measures the rate of radiotracer egress from the ventricle. Integrating measures from these
multimodal methods will provide greater insight into human fluid clearance than could be achieved with any
single modality, and will also provide information about the relative accuracy/predictive ability of each measure
that can inform design of future studies.
Results from this project will provide novel information about brain fluid clearance after TBI that is also relevant
to AD, and that can inform targeted therapies to enhance TBI recovery and reduce future risk of
neurodegeneration."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multi-system, life-threatening, inherited blood disorder that disproportionally affects
low-income vulnerable minorities in the United States. Of the approximately 100,000 individuals living with this
condition in the country, people of African descend account for 90% of patients. A hallmark of the disease is the
development of vascular-endothelial dysfunction that promotes a chronic prothrombotic state increasing the risk
of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Hospitalized pediatric patients with SCD have substantively higher rates of
incident and recurrent VTE compared to the hospitalized general pediatric population. However, despite the
known association between hypercoagulability and SCD, VTE has remained an underrecognized and
understudied complication, particularly in the pediatric SCD population. Specifically, biomarkers and
mechanisms for the development of VTE in pediatric SCD have received little attention in research despite such
work being urgently needed in order to identify modifiable factors for future investigation in interventional trials.
This proposal aims to address this critical gap in knowledge by systematically analyzing VTE data derived from
a multicenter mixed prospective-retrospective cohort with parallel biobanking of pediatric patients with SCD with-
and without VTE. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Identify clinical risk factors for incident (1a) and recurrent (1b) VTE
in pediatric SCD; 2) identify plasma markers of coagulation activation, inflammation, endothelial damage, and
unbiased proteomic profiles prognostic of the development of incident (2a) and recurrent (2b) VTE in pediatric
SCD; and 3) to develop a novel biomarker-informed clinical prognostic model for VTE in pediatric SCD.
The applicant’s long-term goal is to become an independent clinical and translational investigator with expertise
in the development of biomarker-informed VTE clinical prognostic models in pediatric SCD. She has designed
an individual career development plan with the overarching goal of gaining expertise in biomarker discovery and
validation for pediatric VTE, and in the application of biomarkers and clinical risk factors for the development of
VTE prognostic models and the design of risk-stratified VTE prevention trials. The specific aims of her career
development plan are: 1) to obtain mentored, advanced didactic and experiential education and training in
conducting multicenter observational and interventional studies in pediatric VTE and SCD populations; 2) to gain
mentored didactic and hands-on expertise on proteomics methods and biomarker discovery, validation and
implementation in pediatric hematologic diseases; and 3) to obtain mentored, advanced education and training
on the development and application of prognostic models for pediatric hematologic diseases."
10876370,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human brain function relies on the formation and maintenance of precise neural circuits among more than
100 subtypes of neurons. These circuits are mediated by synapses, the characteristics of which vary depending
on neuronal subtype. Synaptic dysfunction plays a critical role in most, if not all, human brain disorders. Thus,
understanding synaptic diversity and its developmental origin are crucial for us to understand how the brain
functions and how it goes awry in mental disorders. During brain development, synapses undergo profound
changes to become mature and fully functional. Maturation of glutamatergic synapses involves changes in the
postsynaptic density (PSD), a highly sophisticated protein complex composed of >1,000 proteins. However, the
compositional changes of the PSD in development were not well characterized. My preliminary data revealed
the temporal dynamics of >1,000 PSD proteins during cerebral cortex development, providing initial insight into
mechanisms of synapse maturation. Moreover, integrative analysis of the developing PSD proteome and single-
cell RNA-seq data suggested that different neuronal subtypes undergo divergent synapse maturation processes.
However, we know little about the compositional diversity of neuronal subtype-specific synapses or the different
maturation processes they go through. In addition, synapse maturation, diversity, and specificity can be
controlled by transcription, but the underlying gene regulatory programs remain elusive. This information is
particularly relevant to mental disorders like autism spectrum disorder, in which genetic mutations converge on
transcription regulation and synaptic transmission. Thus, the specific aims of this project first seek to uncover
the compositional diversity of neuronal subtype-specific synapses in the developing cerebral cortex using a novel
chemogenetic method (Aim 1, K99 phase). The second aim is to decode the disease-relevant gene regulatory
mechanisms that generate this diversity by applying single-cell genomics and machine learning approaches (Aim
2, K99 phase). Finally, using the training, tools, and preliminary data from the K99 phase of my proposal, I will
launch an independent research project that focuses on investigating the effects of neuronal activity on synapse
maturation and plasticity at neuronal subtype resolution (R00 phase). Results from these studies will provide
insights into synapse diversity, its regulatory mechanisms, and its dysregulation in autism. My long-term goal is
to study the functional importance of synapse diversity on neural circuits and behaviors and develop targeted
therapies to alleviate synaptic dysfunction in mental disorders in patients. Additional training obtained during this
award in developmental neurobiology (with Dr. Arnold Kriegstein), synaptic biology (with Dr. Robert Edwards),
chemogenetics (with Dr. Alice Ting), and advanced machine learning (with Dr. Jingjing Li), combined with my
previous experience in rodent models, proteomics, and single-cell genomics will provide me with a solid
foundation for an independent research career to achieve my goal."

The applicant's career goal is to lead a multidisciplinary research program that will investigate a network of
perinatal pathways through which maternal, fetal, and placental physiology impacts fetal brain development
and risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The research will
implement translational and clinical research approaches to uncover early-emerging biomarkers that may
serve as tools for early identification of at-risk children. To effectively establish and lead this research program,
intensive training in longitudinal study design, molecular biology, endocrinology, clinical psychology/psychiatry,
and statistics is required. The K99 study aims to address a crucial gap by evaluating the independent and
interactive effects of prenatal maternal/fetal EVs and maternal/fetal steroid hormones as potential biological
mechanisms underlying infant neurobehavioral and social-emotional development. Postnatally, elevated EV-
associated protein (EV-AP) levels and upregulation of EV microRNAs (miRNAs) have been observed in
individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions including ASD. However, no prior studies have evaluated the
relationship between prenatal maternal/fetal EV-AP levels and later child neurodevelopment. It has also been
shown that higher levels of the Δ4 steroid hormones (progesterone, 17α-hydroxy-progesterone,
androstenedione and testosterone) in amniotic fluid are associated with greater ASD-related behaviors.
Therefore, aberrant levels of both EVs and steroid hormones have been implicated in ASD pathophysiology.
The proposed K99 study will use biological data (maternal/fetal EVs, maternal/fetal steroid hormones) and data
obtained through neurodevelopmental assessments as part of a large, longitudinal pregnancy cohort study to
determine the interactive effect of elevated EV-AP levels and elevated levels of the Δ4 steroids on infant
neurobehavioral and social-emotional development. Elevated levels of EV-AP and Δ4 steroid hormones have
also been observed in women diagnosed with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy or gestational diabetes
mellitus, conditions that are associated with increased neurodevelopmental risk in offspring, suggesting that
these biological mechanisms may mediate the neurodevelopment risk associated with these gestational
conditions. The R00 study will involve a moderated mediation analysis to evaluate whether the level of EV-APs
and Δ4 steroids contributes to the observed association between hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy/gestational diabetes mellitus and offspring neurobehavioral and social-emotional development. This
approach will elucidate new biological mechanisms underlying neurobehavioral development and may provide
important tools to identify children in need of early intervention services."

Arriving at a more granular understanding of the molecular drivers of appetite will represent a major step
towards the ultimate goal of more efficiently treating obesity. AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of
the hypothalamus play a dominant role in maintaining energy balance and are dysregulated in obesity. We
have recently utilized cutting-edge tools to enable an unprecedented cell type-specific characterization of the
transcriptional and epigenomic landscape of AgRP neurons, and this information was leveraged to identify one
transcription factor, Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3) that mediates the acute anorectic effects of leptin.
The current project seeks to examine the role of AgRP neuron IRF3 (IRF3AgRP) in the development of diet-
induced obesity (DIO) involving loss- and gain-of-function experiments while assessing the impact on mouse
body weight, feeding behavior, and leptin sensitivity. The transcriptomic profiles of these IRF3 functional
mouse models will be examined in the lean state in response to leptin, and in the obese state. Additionally, the
direct DNA binding targets of IRF3AgRP will be elucidated using a cutting-edge, low-input, alternative to ChIP-
seq called CUT&RUN, all in the lean fed, fasted, and leptin treated state, and in response to obesity. AgRP
neuron-specific ATAC-seq for lean and obese AgRP neuronal nuclei will also be performed as a means of
assessing the transcriptional regulatory status of IRF3 and other TFs during obesity. Finally, using both lean
and obese mice that are either wild-type or have IRF3 knockout out of all leptin-receptor expressing cells, I will
perform single nucleus RNA-seq as a means of identifying the IRF3-driven transcriptional programs onboard in
the obese state. Overall, these studies will test the overarching hypothesis that IRF3 plays key roles in
mediating both acute leptin sensitivity as well as the development of diet-induced obesity owed to chronic IRF3
activation via hyperleptinemia. The regulatory pathways highlighted in this project will point to novel therapeutic
targets for the treatment of obesity, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. During the course of the mentored
phase of this application, I will further strengthen the computational skills needed to analyze RNA-seq, ATAC-
seq, CUT&RUN, and single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets independently. I will also engage in various career
development experiences, while also receiving invaluable mentorship from my career advisory committee. In
all, the funding of the proposed project will ensure that I round out my scientific and professional training while
laying the foundation for a viable independent academic research program."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, is
characterized by a 95% rate of mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene. After nearly four decades of failure,
the recent clinical approval of a direct KRAS inhibitor targeting one KRAS mutation (G12C) for lung cancer marks
a significant milestone in the development of therapies for KRAS-mutant cancers. KRASG12C-specific inhibitors
have demonstrated dramatic tumor shrinkage in a subset of KRASG12C-mutant patients but essentially all relapse
due to treatment-induced acquired resistance. Genetic analyses of relapsed patients have identified mechanisms
of resistance, with a majority involving mutational activation of signaling components that drive reactivation of
the key KRAS effector pathway, the three-tiered RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade.
Thus, ERK reactivation will limit the long-term efficacy of direct KRAS inhibitors. Despite the highly successful
development of potent and selective inhibitors of each node of the ERK MAPK cascade, when used as
monotherapy, they have shown little to no clinical efficacy against RAS-mutant cancers. Two key issues have
contributed to this outcome, toxicity for normal tissues and de novo or treatment-induced acquired resistance in
cancer cells. I propose that further delineation of the mechanisms by which ERK drives KRAS-dependent cancer
growth will guide the development of more effective anti-ERK therapies. However, the mechanisms by which
ERK drives PDAC growth remain poorly understood. One major unresolved issue is how ERK activity in different
subcellular compartments supports cancer growth. Aim 1 studies comprise my K99 phase of training where I will
take two complementary approaches to gain a better understanding of the role of cytoplasmic and nuclear ERK
activity in supporting KRAS-dependent PDAC growth. First, I will determine the capacity of cytoplasmic versus
nuclear ERK activity in supporting the growth of KRAS-mutant PDAC. Second, I will use a pharmacological
inhibitor of the nuclear export protein exportin-1 (Selinexor) to determine whether it disrupts ERK cytoplasmic-
nuclear dynamics and sensitizes PDAC models to KRAS inhibition. My Aim 2 studies comprise my R00-
supported independent research and are based on our comprehensive ERK-dependent phosphoproteome/
transcriptome studies in KRAS-mutant PDAC. Using these data, I designed a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic loss-of-
function screen library, targeting ERK regulated phosphoproteins and/or transcripts. I will now perform a system-
wide determination of how ERK contributes to PDAC tumorigenesis as well as identify new ERK dependent
targets to combine with KRAS inhibitors. To help me achieve these research goals and successfully transition to
the independent phase I have an exceptional mentoring committee comprised of leading researchers in the study
of KRAS signaling and therapeutics (Channing Der), in ERK spatiotemporal signaling (Jin Zhang), and ERK
substrate utilization (John Blenis). With their guidance I am confident that I will successfully transition to establish
an independent research program where I will advance our knowledge on ERK signaling and therapeutics."

Our population is aging. As our population ages, the incidence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), an
age-associated illness, grows, resulting in elevated health care costs. A second factor contributing
to the current rise in age-associated aliments is the American diet with its ever-increasing amount
of added sugar. The negative effects of added dietary sugar is in part due to advanced glycation
end products (AGEs) which form from the process of glycation where a sugar molecule attaches
to a protein or lipid without enzymatic regulation thereby altering its structure and/or function.
AGEs form in normal metabolism but when AGEs rise to high levels in tissues and circulation, as
in diabetes or high dietary sugar, they can become pathogenic since AGEs promote oxidative
stress and inflammation. A third contributor to the increases in AD is the microbiome; recent
studies have linked age-associated illness with changes in the microbiome. The central unifying
hypothesis of this proposal is that consumption of a sugar-loaded diet alters the microbiome and
contributes to the onset and severity of AD. We will address this hypothesis with two specific aims
using a Caenorhabditis elegans–Escherichia coli system.
 Our experimental C. elegans–E. coli paradigm is an excellent system for these studies
because: (1) C. elegans are bacterivores and have an obligatory symbiotic relationship with
microbes as their food source, which becomes the intestinal microbiota; (2) C. elegans possess
stress and immune signaling pathways that are evolutionarily conserved; (3) Genetic tools are
available including transgenic strains for AD whereby human β-Amyloid precursor protein (Aβ
peptide) is driven by a tissue specific promoter. (4) We can modify the environment (added sugar)
resulting in changes in the levels of dietary AGEs(dAGEs); and (5) Our preliminary data show
when C. elegans consume live (microbiota) or heat killed (no microbiota) sugar-loaded high-
dAGE E. coli, C. elegans have a shortened lifespan and reduced healthspan. Our results also
demonstrate the importance of the microbiota as a buffer for stress. In Specific Aim 1, we will
address the effects of a sugar-loaded high-dAGEs diet on AD transgenic animals with heat killed
or live bacteria. In Specific Aim 2, we use a series of genetic tools, (including mutants,
transgenics)to provide mechanistic insight. This proposal exploits a symbiotic relationship to
define how a sugar loaded/high dAGEs diet promotes Aβ accumulation. Our results in the two-
year period could be paradigm shifting in our understanding of the impact of added dietary glucose
on AD. The long-term goal is to modify diet to delay or even eliminate the onset of AD."

In this new R01 application that is directly responsive to RFA-DA-23-015, our research team proposes to study
the cell type specific molecular mechanisms regulated by fentanyl and methamphetamine polysubstance use
at both the initiation and withdrawal stages of the substance use trajectory. We propose to overcome current
limitations in polysubstance research by utilizing preclinical assays of drug-vs.-food choice procedures in male
and female rats, which more fully capture the severity of polysubstance use seen in humans by modeling the
behavioral misallocation and decision making between concurrently available addictive drugs and alternative
non-drug reinforcers. We will combine these enhanced behavioral models with single nuclei RNA sequencing
(snRNAseq) of the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), key brain regions implicated
in drug reinforcement and drug-taking, to capture and characterize the exact drug-induced molecular
adaptations that occur in specific cell types, including non-neuronal cells. We will directly test the hypothesis
that the synergistic action of combined fentanyl and methamphetamine use produces enhanced drug use
behaviors and brain molecular adaptations that are distinct from what is achieved by either fentanyl or
methamphetamine use alone; that this polysubstance synergy involves unique transcriptional adaptations by
brain region, accumulates as a function of drug experience, and contributes to the behavioral misallocation
towards drug use over more beneficial rewarding activities that is the hallmark of drug addiction. We will test
this overarching hypothesis in two Aims. In Aim 1, we will uncover the impact of fentanyl/methamphetamine
polysubstance use during the withdrawal phase of the substance use trajectory. We will use drug-vs.-food self-
administration choice procedures for saline, fentanyl alone, methamphetamine alone, and
fentanyl/methamphetamine combinations to uncover how an extended history of polysubstance use synergizes
to increase somatic withdrawal effects and drug taking behavior while experiencing withdrawal. We will then
perform snRNAseq in the PFC and NAc to interrogate the brain cell type specific transcriptional adaptations in
these rats. In Aim 2, we will similarly perform drug-vs.-food choice procedures and snRNAseq of these brain
regions to explore the emergence of behavioral and transcriptional adaptations at the of initiation of drug use
experience. We will go on to compare our snRNAseq data from Aims 1 and 2 to understand how the
fentanyl/methamphetamine polysubstance cell type transcriptional profile changes over the substance use
trajectory. This project will reveal how fentanyl and methamphetamine synergize to produce maladaptive drug
choice behaviors and brain cell type specific transcriptional responses at distinct stages of the substance use
trajectory that are common barriers to recovery. Results gained from this project will inform the discovery of
novel and more efficacious pharmacological agents to treat the core decision making process that is uniquely
disrupted by polysubstance use."

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death both worldwide and within the United States. These
diseases are heritable, however there is a large component of this heritability that remains unexplained with
current association studies. For example, a recent study on coronary artery disease (CAD) found that common
SNPs explained only half of CAD heritability. This “missing heritability” could be explained due to the current
focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genetic architecture of cardiovascular diseases. I propose to
investigate the role copy number variants (CNVs) play in cardiovascular diseases.
First, I will develop novel sensitive methods to be able to detect smaller, and many more, CNVs within
individuals using genotype array data, one of the most widely available forms of genetic data. I will use this
method to call CNVs in one of the largest existing biobanks, UK Biobank. This will generate a large database
unique in the ability it provides researchers to detect associations between CNVs and cardiovascular diseases.
Second, using this large database, I will test for associations between CNVs and cardiovascular diseases,
likely leading to CNV-disease associations not previously known. Lastly, I will investigate the extent of CNV
burden among cases of heritable cardiovascular disease and how this burden is distributed across deletions
and duplications, and CNVs of varying spans and frequencies. Exploring and characterizing the role of CNVs
in cardiovascular diseases would further our knowledge of the biological mechanisms of these diseases and
could guide drug development and generate potential paths to preventing or treating these diseases."

In the United States, Black men and women develop hypertension (HTN) at younger ages and have the
highest prevalence, 58% and 57%, compared to aged-matched White men and women 51% and 41%. Early
onset HTN among early midlife Black women (BW) 35-44 years old is also linked to a higher burden of HTN-
mediated organ damage and cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The exact cause of these
disparate outcomes remains unknown but may be due to a greater burden of distinct stressors, i.e., racial,
gender, financial, job, and social network, experienced by BW regardless of socioeconomic position (SEP),
causing weathering and accelerated biological aging. The impact of social and environmentally influenced
stressors are theorized to override the cardioprotective effects of endogenous estrogen in BW and may also
underlie a key mechanism linking stress to acceleration of the aging process and poor cardiovascular health in
this subgroup. Chronic stress is considered a potent risk factor of accelerated aging and age-related diseases,
while aging is considered a potent risk factor of CVD and is linked with arterial stiffness, a predictive marker of
subclinical CVD and mortality risk. Mounting evidence suggests that moderating resources such as resilience,
the process or outcome of successful adaptation despite adversity, may modify the relationship between
chronic stress and aging. Yet, resilience may not be uniformly beneficial and may enhance the adverse effects
of stress. Aligned with the National Institute of Nursing Research high-priority focus on social determinants of
health with an emphasis on the embodiment of social inequalities and health equity, the K23 training aims of
this mixed-method cross sectional study of n=85 BW are: 1) Examine the associations between chronic stress
burden (CSB) overall and each stressor separately on biologic age (BA) and carotid femoral pulse wave
velocity (cf-PWV) stratified by socioeconomic position (SEP); 2) Examine the effects of SEP and resilience on
BA and cf-PWV and whether resilience modifies the effect between CSB and BA, as well as arterial stiffness 3)
Describe perceived sources of CSB and how they influence resilience using semi-structured interviews with a
subsample of 18 women consisting of the highest (n=9) and lowest (n=9) combined tertiles for BA and cf-PWV.
Specific training activities during the K23 award are to obtain: 1) expertise in psychoneuroimmunology, stress,
and health; 2) conduct and interpret cf-PWV measurements; 3) Phlebotomy, lab assay processing and storage;
4) proficiency and acquisition of skills in mixed-methodology research; 5) conduct advanced biostatistical linear
regression methods to measure biological aging. My long-term goal is to apply the knowledge and skills
obtained under this K23 to establish a longitudinal cohort examining the role of SEP, chronic stress, and health
protective resources that may enhance or mitigate physiologic dysregulation and CVD risk over time."
10885162,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations during embryonic development, aging, cellular metabolism, and environmental exposure are
permanently recorded in the genomes of each cell and its daughters. Depending upon whether the mutations
can be detected in regular next-generation sequencing, they are recognized as clonal or non-clonal in nature
and present different features. Elucidating the patterns of these mutations and their potential to transmit to
offspring is key to understanding congenital de novo mutation (DNM) disorders and genetic variability across
human generations. As parents age, the number of DNMs in their germ cells increases, and with this, an
increased risk of DNMs and the disease they cause in offspring. Although age-related DNM risks have been
reported in large populations, our understanding of how paternal-specific clonal and non-clonal mosaicism
contribute to offspring and how natural selection shapes the mutation pattern is still limited. During my previous
graduate and postdoctoral research, I established the concept that a considerable portion of DNMs in children
with neurological and psychiatric disorders arise from clonal mosaic mutations in the sperm (Yang, et al. Cell
2021). I developed experimental and computational pipelines to accurately detect clonal mosaic mutations in
bulk samples with deep whole-genome sequencing (Yang, et al. Nature Biotechnology, in press; Breuss, Yang,
co-firsts, et al. Nature 2022). In this K99/R00 application, I aim to unravel the feature of the non-clonal gonadal
mutation burden at the single-cell level, employing multidisciplinary approaches spanning the mentored [K99]
and independent [R00] award phases. I will compare the genomic sequences from 700 single human sperm
from bulk sperm sequences in 35 healthy young men, analyze the genomic positions where the non-clonal
mutations tend to reside compared to the clonal ones, and study the impact of those mutations (Aim 1). I will
develop new computational software to accurately detect mosaic mutations from single cells not only from
haploid and diploid genomes, and develop experimental approaches to accurately validate the somatic mutations
from single-cell amplified DNA (Aim 2). Finally, I will measure the single-cell DNA mutation rate and mutation
patterns using 2300 single sperm from an additional 45 young versus 75 aged donors for clues on age-related
mutational mechanisms and how they will impact the genome stability in the next generation before and after
natural selection (Aim 3). Overall, the results from this proposal will help us to understand the non-clonal mosaic
mutational burden, mutation distributions, as well as mutational functions in human sperm, and the age-related
genetic impacts on the genome stability of the next generation. My career goal is to lead an independent research
group focusing on somatic mutations in the human genome, their causes, and predicting their consequences on
child health. During the K99 phase, I will continue to receive subject recruitment, reproductive science,
experimental, computational, and career development training from my postdoctoral advisor Dr. Gleeson, co-
mentors Dr. Wilkinson and Sebat, as well as external mentors at UC San Diego and other institutes. The rigorous
mentored support will greatly my knowledge in human subject handling and reproductive science, as well as
getting me prepared for job applications. The results obtained in the K99 phase will facilitate my transition to an
independent investigator in the R00 phase and lay the foundation for my future career."
10894124,"Time-to-event is a ubiquitous outcome measure in clinical diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic effects in
many disease areas including stroke (time-to-stroke), respiratory (time-to-first medication for worsening asthma)
and sleep diseases (time-to-insomnia-related mortality). The hazard rate is commonly seen in survival analysis
as it has the convenient interpretation of instantaneous risk. The hazard ratio (HR) is routinely used as an effect
measure when comparing between two treatment groups, largely due to the popular Cox proportional hazards
(PH) model. However, the HR is vulnerable to selection bias and not collapsible, which make it a questionable
marginal causal effect measure. Restricted mean survival time (RMST) is an alternative measure, defined as the
area under the survival curve up to a fixed time point. RMST difference is a more adequate causal effect measure
than the HR because (i) it is a collapsible measure, thus avoids discrepancy between marginal and conditional
effects; (ii) it does not depend on the PH assumption; (iii) it is essentially a mean difference with simpler
interpretation. RMST has become a popular metric of treatment effects in randomized trials recently. However,
the development of RMST methodology for observational survival data is lacking. The goal of this proposal is
to develop a comprehensive matching-based RMST difference estimation strategy to infer causal effects
in observational survival data, and apply such tools to evaluate causal effects of direct oral
anticoagulants (DOAC) vs. warfarin on the risk of cardiovascular events in a secondary data analysis.
We plan to develop propensity score matching-based RMST estimation methodology and corresponding
sensitivity analysis, which do not rely on strong outcome modeling assumptions. The matching method will use
an optimal algorithm to create matched sets to mimic a block randomized design and an asymptotically valid
post-matching inferential procedure will be developed by accounting for the correlation introduced in matching.
Built upon the matched data, the sensitivity analysis will address how much association an unmeasured
confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, to explain away the observed effect.
In the secondary data analysis, we will apply our methods to examine the hypothesis that using DOAC has lower
risk of composite cardiovascular events including stroke, venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and
death, using electronic medical record (EMR) data. We will also explore subgroup causal effects related to
gender and race to examine potential health disparity issues. Our proposed work will not only result in novel and
valid research methodology for estimating causal effects in observational survival data, but also advance the
understanding of how different anticoagulant drugs would impact patient outcomes using a large secondary
database. Our general-purpose methodology will be widely applicable to study survival data in heart, lung, blood
and sleep disease treatment, and disparity research. This will also enable clinical researchers to rigorously
identify causal evidence using increasingly available real-world data."

Mental, emotional, and behavioral (MEB) disorders begin in early childhood, with one in six US preschoolers
aged 3-5 years diagnosed with a MEB disorder. Children from low income and economically marginalized
(LIEM) backgrounds have a higher risk of being diagnosed with MEB disorders than those from higher income
families. To address the mental and physical health disparities based on socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race,
and urban/rural residency, the proposed study will target Head Start racially/ethnically diverse preschoolers
from LIEM backgrounds in both urban and rural areas. Guided by the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model,
the Allostatic Load Model, and the Transactional Theory of Stress and Coping, the proposed 16-week Food-
Body-Mind intervention includes: 1) a school-based mindfulness component delivered to equip preschoolers
with knowledge and skills in mindful eating and movement (e.g., yoga, deep breathing exercises); 2) a home-
based mindfulness component to increase caregivers’ skills in practicing mindful eating, movement, and
parenting behaviors at home to foster a more positive, mindful, and healthy home environment; and 3) a school
learning and home practice connection component to improve caregiver-preschooler relationships. The
purpose of this 5-year cluster randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects of the 16-week school- and
home-based, multi-component, Food-Body-Mind intervention on improving both preschoolers’ and caregivers’
MEB and physical health. The long-term goal is to achieve optimal whole child health in early childhood to
foster a healthier generation in the US. Fifty Head Start daycare centers will be randomized into the
intervention (n=25: 8 urban [16 classrooms] and 17 rural [17 classrooms] daycare centers) or usual care
control group (n=25: 8 urban and 17 rural daycare centers). Five caregiver-preschooler dyads will be recruited
from each daycare classroom (total 330 dyads: 160 urban dyads and 170 rural dyads). Analyses will be based
on the intention-to-treat principle. The three aims are to: 1) determine effects of the intervention on improving
preschoolers’ primary outcomes including mental (chronic stress), emotional (sadness, fear, anger, positive
affect), and behavioral (problem behaviors, social skills) health as well as physical health (BMI z-score, % body
fat; secondary outcomes) from baseline (0 month) to 4 months (immediate post-intervention) and to 12-month
follow-up compared to control; 2) examine the effects of the intervention on improving caregivers’ physical
(BMI, % body fat, blood pressure) and mental (stress, anxiety, depression) health from 0 to 4 months and to
12-month follow-up compared to control; and 3) explore how the intervention will modify both preschoolers’ and
caregivers’ MEB and physical health via the mediating mechanisms of mindfulness, emotional eating,
fruit/vegetable intake, physical activity, caregiver-preschooler relationship, and caregiver coping from 0 to 4
months and to 12-month follow-up. Results from this study will improve the evidence base of complementary
and integrative health approaches that can be delivered in geographically diverse daycare settings."
10888408,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death. After an MI, limited
regeneration occurs, and instead, inflammation and scarring cause the affected myocardial tissue to turn fibrotic
and thin. This tissue remodeling results in abnormal tissue mechanics and impaired cardiac function, often
leading to heart failure and death. Therefore, a promising therapeutic approach is to reduce inflammation and
the adverse tissue remodeling of the infarct zone. Unfortunately, many emerging drug candidates to achieve
these goals require prolonged dosing over multiple weeks, greatly limiting their clinical translation. To overcome
this challenge, I propose the development of a hydrogel that is catheter-injectable and enables the one-time
injection of a drug payload into the myocardium for long-term release. This multidisciplinary project merges my
expertise in drug delivery, polymeric materials, and cardiovascular bioengineering. Specifically, I propose a
nanoparticle-based, therapy-eluting gel that will be retained within the contractile myocardium to locally deliver
the chosen therapy at a controlled rate. This hydrogel will address two challenges in cardiovascular therapies 1)
retention in the myocardium due to the mechanically active heart and 2) delivery of a sustained therapeutic dose
that preserves the bioactivity in the harsh environment of the infarct zone. In this project, I propose to deliver two
potential therapeutics investigated in clinical trials to address inflammation and adverse remodeling. Anakinra
delivered daily through subcutaneous injection has emerged as a promising candidate to reduce inflammation
and prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI. Fresolimumab has potential to mitigate heart failure after MI by
preventing fibroblast activation into myofibroblasts and thereby limiting fibrosis. However, to elicit a therapeutic
effect, these drugs must be present for an extended duration via multiple daily injections. Therefore, novel
therapeutics like Anakinra and Fresolimumab are limited in efficacy and clinical use and would greatly benefit
from materials science approaches that would reduce the need for painful daily injections by enabling them to
be delivered locally within the myocardium in a reservoir that can protect their bioactivity, limit their off-target
effects, and offer tunable release kinetics that can match the therapeutic window of the chosen drugs. In the K99
mentored phase of this grant, I will develop the catheter-injectable hydrogel and demonstrate retention within
the myocardium (Aim 1), tailor the release kinetics of the nanoparticles to achieve both rapid and sustained
payload delivery of Anakinra (Aims 2), and demonstrate the therapeutic effect in a preclinical rat model of MI
(Aim 3). In the R00 phase, the modular hydrogel technology will be expanded to include a second type of
nanoparticle to enable the combinatorial release of Anakinra and Fresolimumab (hydrophobic and hydrophilic
drugs, respectively) (Aim 4) and improve heart function quantitatively after an MI by preventing adverse
remodeling in a rat preclinical model (Aim 5)."
10894055,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT:
Candidate: Dr. Courtney Mangus is a pediatric emergency medicine (EM) physician and health services
researcher at the University of Michigan (U-M) Medical School. She is interested in identifying and testing ways
to improve diagnostic safety and patient engagement via shared decision-making (SDM) in the community
emergency department (ED) setting, which is under-resourced compared to tertiary care EDs. Her goal is to
become an independent investigator and leader in the field, improving the quality of care for children evaluated
for common pediatric conditions, such as abdominal pain, in community EDs. Research Context: The most
common pediatric surgical emergency, appendicitis, is ideally diagnosed with ultrasonography. However, 85%
of children seek care in community EDs, which often have limited resources. As such, children presenting with
abdominal pain in this setting are more likely to undergo computed tomography (CT). CT imaging is the most
sensitive diagnostic test for appendicitis, but it exposes children to ionizing radiation and ultimately increases
their risk of developing cancer. Risk stratification tools exist to help clinicians determine which children with
abdominal pain require imaging, but for the ~50% children in community EDs who fall into the group of
intermediate risk for appendicitis, clinicians often face a dilemma regarding next diagnostic steps. Data suggest
most clinicians choose either 1) CT imaging or 2) watchful waiting (observation or discharge with scheduled
follow-up). Because this dilemma is so common, a systematic, family-centered approach is needed to
communicate diagnostic options, including risks/benefits, and engage families in the decision-making process.
Development and implementation of an intervention to facilitate SDM in this scenario has the potential to
reduce unnecessary CT scans and increase family engagement in the diagnostic process. Research Aims: In
this project, Dr. Mangus will utilize an iterative, user-centered design approach to develop and refine a risk-
tailored intervention to facilitate SDM in the diagnosis of pediatric abdominal pain in the community ED setting
(Aims 1a/1b) and pilot the intervention via a randomized controlled trial of 100 ED patients presenting with
signs and symptoms of appendicitis to a community ED (Aim 2). The research will be conducted at Hurley
Medical Center (HMC), a community hospital in Flint, Michigan, which serves a large population of racial/ethnic
minority and low-income children (AHRQ priority populations). Career Development Plan: Dr. Mangus will
undertake the proposed research plan under the expert mentorship of Drs. Mahajan, Manojlovich, Schoenfeld
and Singh. Her career development curriculum is focused on mixed methods research, training in SDM
intervention development, and clinical trial methodology. The proposal utilizes the resources of the U-M
Department of EM, U-M’s Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine, the U-M Institute for
Healthcare Policy and Innovation, and HMC. In alignment with the mission of AHRQ, Dr. Mangus’ long-term
goals are to improve patient-centered care and diagnostic safety for children requiring emergency care."

Hawai‘i is the most ethnically diverse state in the US. Native Hawaiians (NH), Pacific Islanders (PI) and Asian
Americans (AsA) account for nearly 70% of the state’s population & it is home to >50% of all NHPI in the US.
This UG3/UH3 proposal will establish a new prospective, multi-generational cohort to investigate
cardiopulmonary & metabolic (CPM) health among NH & Micronesian PI in Hawai‘i. These 2 distinct, yet
understudied, sub-populations have an excess burden of CPM disease outcomes. Diabetes mellitus (DM)
occurs in 28% and preDM in 37% of NHPI (>20y.o.), suggesting >50% of NHPI have or are at-risk for DM.
CVD mortality is 4-fold higher in NHPI with DM compared with nonDM. CVD mortality is the leading cause of
death among NHPI. Despite decades of clinical & intervention studies among NHPI, CPM health inequities
remain largely unchanged & is increasing among younger NH and PI people. Our proposal, the Pacific Ocean
Native Observational (PONO) Health Legacy Study, will directly confront methodological challenges (i.e.
racial aggregation, small sample size, etc.) of prior NHPI studies & will conduct innovative, technology-driven
“populomics” approaches to change the course of CPM health disparities among NH & PI. Our approach builds
on a strong interdisciplinary team of scientific & community-based leaders who bring decades of community,
clinical, epidemiological & epigenomic expertise. We will work closely with the Coordinating Center to
maximize the overall AsA-NHPI cohort’s ability to conduct studies of multiple hypotheses testing. Our specific
aims (S.A.) are as follows:
S.A.#1 (UG3): Establish a prospective, community-engaged, multi-generational population-based
cohort study of 2,500 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in Hawai‘i. Our longstanding partnerships
with clinical & community-based groups are primed & enthusiastic to recruit, retain & conduct standardized
data & biological specimen collection that will invest in the health of future generations.
S.A. #2 (UH3): Characterize the relationship of risk and resilience factors with clinical blood-based
biomarkers of metabolic and immunologic function relevant to CPM conditions. Determine prevalence of
CPM subclinical disease & conduct association studies of multi-level risk & resilience factors by CPM
conditions.
S.A. #3 (UH3): Assess the impact of CPM-associated risk and resilience factors on incident CPM-
outcomes measured over time between Hawai‘i and continental populations of NH and PI in the AsA-
NHPI cohort study. Determine incidence of CPM outcomes associated with multi-level risk/resilience factors &
to compare data with relevant subpopulations in the overall AsANHPI cohort.
The overall impact of the PONO study is its potential to transform health disparity research through
novel “populomics” approaches in a representative population of AsANHPI in the US."

An HIV vaccine represents our best opportunity for eliciting durable, protective immunity and ending the
decades-long AIDS pandemic. To be successful, an antibody-based HIV vaccine must reliably induce broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), most likely via a series of immunogens or mixtures of immunogens delivered
sequentially. To avoid viral escape, bnAbs of at least 2-3 distinct specificities must be induced concurrently.
Thus, a more holistic view of HIV vaccine composition would resemble a matrix of immunogens rather than a
sequence. Constructing a single set of immunogens that reliably induce breadth against just one epitope is a
daunting challenge. Succeeding in the exponentially more difficult task of assembling a cohesive immunogen
matrix will require significant improvements in the speed and granularity with which we can design and evaluate
vaccines. Here, we propose a solution: by embedding multi-omics technology at each stage of immunogen
development, we can unlock a revolutionary increase in scale while simultaneously improving the depth and
resolution of our analyses. The Multi-Omics Vaccine Evaluation (MOVE) Consortium brings together a multi-
disciplinary team of expert investigators with a long history of productive collaboration. Our central hypothesis
is that deeply integrating advanced multi-omics approaches throughout our iterative vaccine development
pipeline will speed the discovery of an HIV vaccine by allowing us to operate concurrently across multiple
immunogens. Our overall mission is to accelerate development of an HIV vaccine by parallelizing the design
and testing of a matrix of complementary immunogens that reliably induce broad, durable immunity. To
accomplish our objectives, we propose the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Profile the human immunogenicity of a novel V2 apex-focusing Env trimer.
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate Q23-elicited immune responses, candidate boosting immunogens, and delivery
strategies in humanized animal models.
Specific Aim 3: Develop the Q23 backbone into a multi-epitope priming immunogen."
10852993,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The MOVE Consortium seeks to accelerate the development of an HIV vaccine through an iterative framework
to design and test a matrix of complementary immunogens that reliably induce broad, durable immunity. Within
this collaborative, interdependent effort, the MOVE Consortium produces vast amounts of rapidly changing,
heterogeneous data, creating challenges in managing, tracking, and sharing data.
The goal of the Data Management and Bioinformatics Core is to promote the reuse and understanding of
the large, multidisciplinary multi-omics data we generate. We aim to release as much of our data and results
as possible, as quickly as possible, by managing, tracking, and monitoring all MOVE activities and data assets
and publishing them on our MOVE Data Portal, data.hivmove.org. To aid in the understanding of these data,
we will develop approaches to improve the accessibility and interpretability of our data through innovative
bioinformatics software and visualization tools. Lastly, we seek to engage with the community to promote the
adoption and adaptation of our data and tools and to proliferate FAIR-sharing best practices throughout the
research community.
To accomplish these objectives and support the overall mission of the MOVE Consortium, we have the following
three aims. First, we will develop reproducible pipelines for capturing data and metadata. Next, we will design
and implement a custom interactive data portal and API for sharing the data according to FAIR data practices
(findable, accessible, interoperable, reproducible). Lastly, we will develop tools in support of Projects 1 and 2,
the Animal Models Core, and the Structural Proteomics Core to accelerate the characterization of human
immunogenicity of Q23, identification of boosting immunogen candidates, and evaluation of delivery
mechanisms. These aims will promote the sharing and reuse of MOVE data, develop extendable and reusable
technologies and practices for data sharing, and build new analysis and visualization tools for immunological
data."

10897062,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Exposure to early life stress (ELS), including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction, significantly
increases the risk of mental illness, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. The
previously characterized effects ELS and chronic disease development in adults may have their origins in ELS-
dependent effects on composition and functions of the gut microbiota. The gut microbiota interact directly with
the host’s immune and neurological systems and microbial derived metabolites have been shown to mediation
cardiovascular function. My recently published research using a mouse model of ELS has determined that ELS
alters the gut microbiota independent of maternal inheritance. This suggests ELS-medicated endogenous
factors within the offspring are responsible for the ELS microbial phenotype. However, it remains unknown
whether ELS-mediated changes in the gut microbiota play a direct role in the genesis risk factors for CVD. This
proposal will address these knowledge gaps by identifying ELS-medicated factors that regulate the gut
microbiota and elucidating microbial-mediated pathways that lead to increased CVD risk due to ELS.
 Adolescents and young adults with ELS have increased arterial stiffness and systemic vascular
resistance. Using an established mouse model of ELS involving maternal separation, our novel data indicate
that ELS is also associated with increased arterial stiffness in adolescent and adult mice. Furthermore, ELS
induces superoxide production and endothelial dysfunction in adult mice. This suggests that vascular
dysfunction is an important mediator of ELS-induced CVD risk. Our new data in mice show that ELS leads to
reduced gut microbial diversity, lower circulating short-chain-fatty acids (SCFAs), and impaired gut barrier
function during adolescence. Gut microbial diversity is negatively associated with arterial stiffness in women
and reduced SCFAs are associated with hypertension and impaired gut barrier function. This suggests a role
for the gut microbiota in ELS-induced vascular dysfunction, though exact mechanisms remain undefined.
Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate mechanisms by which microbial metabolites
mediate ELS-induced aortic stiffening and endothelial dysfunction and examine the potential of diet in the early
intervention of CVD risk."

This comprehensive training program described in this five-year proposal is designed to prepare Dr. Staudt to
transition to a career as a productive independent investigator focused on deciphering the molecular
mechanisms underlying diastolic heart disease. Over the course of the described studies, Dr. Staudt will expand
his skills in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte phenotyping at the single-cell level, as well as
acquire new skills in biophysical analysis of pathogenic myosin mutations and high-throughput assay design and
analysis. Further, he will obtain substantial experience and training in mentorship, scientific presentation, and
grant writing. These skills will be crucial for his successful transition to independence. This proposal assembles
an impressive team of world-renowned experts in cardiovascular biology to guide him, including his co-mentors,
Drs. Mark Mercola and Euan Ashley, as well as the members of his mentorship committee, Drs. Joseph Wu,
Marlene Rabinovich, and Don Bers. Their support will provide the resources and mentorship that Dr. Staudt
needs to succeed in an independent academic career at the conclusion of the K08 award.
The scientific aim of this project is to uncover mechanisms leading to diastolic dysfunction, an abnormal stiffness
of the ventricular muscle that contributes to nearly half of heart failure cases. Specifically, this proposal focuses
on Pediatric Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (RCM), a severe genetic disorder characterized by isolated, profound
diastolic dysfunction. Patients with this disease have few treatment options, stemming from a relative lack of
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease. This proposal leverages novel stem cell
models of RCM combined with high-throughput measurement of diastolic function to probe these mechanisms.
In Aim 1, multiple cellular models of RCM will be characterized and compared to determine whether different
classes of RCM mutations act via similar or divergent mechanisms. Aim 2 uses a functional genomics approach
to determine whether different mutations evoke distinct pathogenic mechanisms that converge on a similar
clinical presentation. Aim 3 focuses on a unique line from a patient with severe, pediatric onset RCM caused by
a de novo mutation in cardiac myosin. In this aim, a novel multi-scale approach links the biophysical effects of
this RCM mutation on myosin molecules to the physiologic changes in whole cells, and compares this to a
comparable, previously characterized myosin mutation that causes Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, a more
common but generally less severe disease."

 Mitochondrial dysfunction and altered mitochondrial metabolism have been implicated in the development
of heart failure (HF). Mitophagy is a specialized autophagic pathway that mediates the lysosome-dependent
clearance of damaged mitochondria, and is essential for mitochondrial quality control. However, our current
knowledge regarding mitophagy in the heart and how it relates to myocardial metabolism is limited. Under normal
conditions, the heart relies predominantly on fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) to fuel ATP production. In contrast, a
failing or hypertrophied heart usually shows impaired FAO and increased reliance on glucose utilization. Despite
significant advancements in understanding the regulatory programs that attenuate FAO, it is unclear how shifts
in myocardial substrate utilization contribute to the regulation of mitophagy. Therefore, this research proposal
focuses on the functional significance of cardiac mitophagy in response to altered myocardial substrate utilization
that occurs, for instance, in the setting of impaired FAO. The goal of this project is to delineate the novel
mechanistic link between mitophagy and myocardial substrate utilization in the heart, as well as to determine
whether mitophagy represents a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for the treatment of heart disease.
These studies will be facilitated by our recently described mt-Keima mouse model to monitor in vivo cardiac
mitophagy, as well as a set of innovative reagents to genetically and pharmacologically modulate mitophagic
flux. To directly assess the role of FAO in the heart, we have generated mice with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion
of CPT2 (CPT2-cKO), encoding a single gene required for FAO. We have demonstrated a decline in mitophagy
precedes the development of impaired cardiac function in FAO-deficient hearts. Our genetic analyses suggest
cardiac CPT2 deletion impairs the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) signaling pathway, which positively
regulates mitophagy through mitochondrial ubiquitination. Augmentation of mitophagy by modulating USP30,
which mediates the reverse reaction, deubiquitination on mitochondria, mitigates the functional decline in FAO
deficient hearts. Therefore, in Aim 1 of the proposed studies, our goal is to define the magnitude and Kinetics of
cardiac mitophagy in response to impaired FAO, as well as to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms
connecting mitophagy to myocardial substrate utilization. In Aim 2 of the proposed studies, we will genetically
and pharmacologically manipulate USP30 enzymatic function in the heart using mouse models that lack USP30
or are treated with a novel USP30 inhibitor. We will determine whether the detrimental cardiac phenotype,
induced by cardiac CPT2 deletion or pressure overload, could be reversed, at least partially, by restoring
mitophagy in cardiomyocytes via the inhibition of USP30. Completion of the proposed studies will produce critical
insights into the role of mitophagy in normal cardiovascular physiology and in pathological conditions, and will
fundamentally advance our understanding of the interaction between mitochondrial metabolism and
mitochondrial quality control in the heart."

Schizophrenia is a devastating illness with no cure, affecting about 1% of the population worldwide, costing
billions of dollars annually. The scientific premise for this proposal is based on accumulating imaging,
postmortem, animal model, genetic, and bioinformatics data converging on alterations in the production of
bioenergetic molecules in myriad brain regions in this illness. We previously reported abnormally high levels of
lactate in living patients with schizophrenia that were strongly associated with poor cognitive function. This
finding complements our induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) and postmortem work showing higher lactate
levels in schizophrenia in iPSC-derived cortical neurons and postmortem anterior cingulate cortex in subjects
with schizophrenia. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that diminished cognitive functioning in
schizophrenia is due to impaired bioenergetic metabolism in limbic circuits with increased pathological
generation or utilization of lactate in schizophrenia. Specifically, we posit that there is increased production
and release of lactate from astrocytes, coupled with increased uptake and utilization of lactate, in lieu of
glucose uptake and oxidative phosphorylation, to produce ATP in support of neuronal plasticity in limbic
circuits. This new R01 project uses complementary, but distinct approaches, to examine abnormalities of
bioenergetic function in schizophrenia. For SA1, we will use magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to
quantify lactate levels and comprehensively characterize patients using neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive,
functioning, and metabolic assessments. For Aim 2, cultured human neurons/astrocytes derived from iPSCs
obtained in SA1 to assess lactate production and utilization challenges. We will further delineate the functional
consequences of lactate production on cellular energy metabolism and neuronal development/function at
molecular and cellular levels in cultured human iPSC-derived neurons/astrocytes. In Aim 3, we will use a
bioinformatics approach to identify lactate-associated targets for cell-subtype specific studies of
biochemical/lactate changes in postmortem brain. Taken together, our aims will comprehensively assess
perturbations of lactate and lactate associated pathways across clinical, tissue culture, and postmortem
substrates in schizophrenia. By developing a more sophisticated understanding of the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia, this project will help identify targets in bioenergetic pathways for development of treatment
interventions for this debilitating illness."

Because neurons integrate and process information via modulation of their membrane potential, the ability to monitor voltage is critical to understanding how single and groups of neurons compute. Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) —fluorescent proteins that report voltage dynamics as changes in brightness— are emerging as a preferred recording method because they can track voltage transients with high spatiotemporal resolution and cell type specificity. Particularly sought after are GEVIs that perform well under two-photon (2P) microscopy, the method of choice for imaging neural activity in highly scattering tissue such as the rodent brain. We have recently demonstrated that a combination of the 2P optical recording method ULoVE and the indicator JEDI-2P enable sustained (> 30 min), fast (> 1 kHz), deep-tissue (< 400 µm) monitoring of voltage dynamics in individual neuronal somas in awake behaving mice. However, ULoVE is fundamentally unable to record from cells and structures located in different focal planes. This is a critical limitation as neuronal computations typically involve cells or neurites located at different depths. The goal of this proposal is to address this technology gap and enable three-dimensional optical voltage recordings in awake-behaving mice. We propose to optimize 3D-CASH, a new method that enables the three-dimensional recording of calcium dynamics but whose lower signal-to-noise ratio prevents reliable voltage recordings. We propose several complementary but independent approaches to improving the signal-to-noise ratio of voltage recordings, including hardware-based strategies for efficiently exciting cells/structures while minimizing motion artifacts and neuropil background fluorescence (Aim 1). We also propose a new generation of GEVIs that improve the detectability of subthreshold and spikes (Aim 2) and optimized methods for subcellular localization of GEVIs to increase the signal from specific structures of interest such as dendrites or somas while reducing background contamination (Aim 3). We anticipate that this project will produce improved GEVIs of general utility for neuroscience applications and a new optical approach that enables three-dimensional voltage recordings in vivo. These new technologies will allow the neuroscience community to ask questions that are currently technically infeasible, paving the way for a more detailed understanding of dendritic integration and neural network computations in living animals."

Unexplained infertility accounts for 25% of infertility cases. One of the challenges in identifying factors related to
infertility, particularly unexplained infertility is that there are no live births. A hallmark of genes essential in
oogenesis and during preimplantation development is a failure to progress to the point a viable pregnancy can
be recognized. As such, identifying genes essential to the these crucial stages is an important step in
understating unexplained infertility. Prior research suggests that Bmal1-/- mice produce embryos which are largely
lost before the blastocyst stage, even when implanted into pseudopregnant wildtype mice. Dr. Cassin’s
preliminary data suggests that initial deficits occur much earlier as Bmal1-/- oocytes are largely observed to be
abnormal, likely leading to the phenotype previously described. Further, preliminary work in this grant reveals
that BMAL1 is expressed in developing follicles and throughout preimplantation development. BMAL1 has been
shown to regulate many of the most essential regulatory functions in early development such as cap-dependent
translation, and mRNA regulation, but the role of Bmal1 has not yet been investigated. This grant proposes the
examination of Bmal1 during oogenesis and the maternal to zygotic transition (MZT). The overarching hypothesis
of this grant is Bmal1 is an essential maternal factor during oogenesis, aids in the regulation of many essential
early genes transcribed by the embryo, and regulates a cell-autonomous embryonic clock. Aim1 will address the
expression and phenotype of Bmal1 activity during oogenesis. The guiding hypothesis for Aim1 is a primary
deficit in oogenesis as a result of Bmal1 m-KO contributes to poor oocyte quality and defects in MZT progression.
This Aim will be addressed through the use of embryo culture and immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. The
guiding hypothesis for Aim2 is BMAL1 is an essential factor for preimplantation through the regulation of both
maternal mRNAs as well as early embryonic genome activation. As BMAL1 has many regulatory functions Aim2
combine rescue experiments with several -omics techniques to investigate the specific function that BMAL1 has
in the MZT. Aim3 examines the regulation of the MZT by Bmal1. The guiding hypothesis of Aim3 is the cell-
autonomous clock of the developing embryo is regulated through Bmal1. To address Aim3 live cell imaging of
reporter mice will be used to observe movement of BMAL1 throughout the cell. This work specifically focuses on
one gene, Bmal1. However, because Bmal1 is a gene involved in many regulatory pathways, this grant opens
up a new area of research, the circadian genes in early development. Further, it identifies a novel potential factor
in unexplained infertility, and identifies a new direction in the field of infertility. Dr. Cassin will be trained by her
mentors in the fields of embryology and circadian biology. Together with training in presenting, scientific writing,
and bioinformatics, Dr. Cassin will possess all the skills necessary to establish a successful, independent lab
following the mentored phase of the grant."

Up to 42% of Americans with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) experience uncontrolled, chronic
symptoms that reduce health-related quality of life and heighten the risk of long-term complications. My long-
term goal is to improve health outcomes for patients with esophageal disorders. This proposal aims to improve
health outcomes for patients with GERD, by harnessing patient activation and motivating behavioral change as
a framework for a mobile health (mHealth) Question Prompt List (QPL) intervention. Patient activation
emphasizes patients’ knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing their health care and predicts patients’
level of health success. However, almost half of patients with GERD demonstrate low patient activation scores.
Low patient activation leads to poor adherence to medical therapy. Remarkably, very little research has
focused on developing an intervention to improve patient activation and motivate behavior change in GERD.
Emerging evidence suggests effective patient-physician communication interventions, such as disease-specific
QPLs, increase patient activation. The objective of this proposal is to apply a 5-step user-centered Design
Thinking model to develop, refine, and test a mobile app based QPL specific for GERD patients titled
“Esophagus-Qs.” The central hypothesis is that Esophagus-Qs will be usable and has potential to harness
patient activation and motivate behavior change. Our specific aims include: 1) Develop the design of
Esophagus-Qs by empathizing, defining the problems patients face, and ideating to generate solutions; 2)
Refine the design of Esophagus-Qs by prototyping and testing usability; and 3) Collect preliminary data on
Esophagus-Qs in a randomized controlled pilot study to estimate the effect size of the intervention. We will
pursue these aims using an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies and
implementation science to inform app development. The proposed research is significant, because it has
potential to harness patient activation and motivate behavior change, that can translate into improved health
outcomes. It is also significant because it will develop a platform that can be extended to develop mHealth
QPLs in other esophageal disorders. The proximate expected outcome of this work is to develop a usable
Esophagus-Qs and collect preliminary data on differences in patient activation over time, medication
adherence, health-related quality of life, and GERD symptom severity between Esophagus-Qs and standard of
care. Pilot data from this career development award will be the foundation for an R01-funded clinical trial to
rigorously test the efficacy of Esophagus-Qs among a large, diverse population."

This Shared Equipment Evaluation Program (ShEEP) application requests funds to
purchase a Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 980 with AiryScan 2 that will be
used to support the research mission at the Central Virginia VA Health Care System
(CVHCS). Six major VA-funded investigators including Drs. Dupree, Huizar, Zhou, Tan,
Neuwelt, and Ren require this equipment to generate high and super resolution, high
quality multi-labeled, z-stack images of fixed tissue and live cells in real to support their
VA Merit or CDA2 funded grants. In addition to these 6 VA funded investigators, an
additional 4 minor users (Drs. Baron, Pandak, Kapadia and Lafrenaye) will also use the
microscope system to continue their veterans’ related research and to generate the
essential preliminary data to compile and submit competitive VA Merit applications. The
requested Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 980 with AiryScan 2 provides
investigators with the capability to collect high and super resolution (120nm x/y), 2D, 3D
and 4D fluorescent images of both formaldehyde fixed samples and live cells. The
microscope will be equipped with a combination of dry and oil immersion objective lens
ranging from 10X to 63X magnifications and 7 solid state LED lamps with optimal
excitation wave lengths ranging from 385nm to 630nm. The software that supports the
microscope enables accurate and reproducible image collection with high scientific rigor
by providing easy Nyquist sampling and lambda/spectral image collection based on the
utilization of the 32-element detector. The scan head is equipped to image greater than
30 channels simultaneously without compromising resolution or image quality.
The Zeiss Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope 980 with AiryScan 2 will facilitate our
investigators to conduct their existing, funded studies and to pursue unexplored areas of
research with greater efficiency and accuracy that can be currently achieved. Presently,
the CVHCS does not have a confocal microscope or any similar imaging equipment. VA
researchers must use the confocal microscope at our academic affiliate, which is a 15-
minute drive from the CVHCS campus resulting in decreased productivity and
potentially compromising sample quality and data accuracy. Therefore, we request
ShEEP funds to purchase this microscope for use in our ongoing VA-funded studies
related to neurodegenerative disease, cancer, metabolic liver disease, heart
arrythmia/disease, movement disorder and head trauma. The acquisition of this state-
of-the-art microscope will significantly expand our Core Facility capabilities for basic and
translational studies and promote collaborations within the CVHCS and between
CVHCS researchers and VA-funded investigators outside the CVHCS consistent with
the Enterprise research model initiated by the VA research program."

To find therapies for altering the course of age-related diseases, experimental methods that discriminate
between normal and pathological aging processes are needed. Nowhere is this need more urgent than in the
quest for effective treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite decades of research, AD remains a
debilitating, progressive, and ultimately fatal dementia with few and ineffective disease-modifying treatment
options. The vast majority of cases (~95%) are sporadic, with no known cause aside from advanced age. As
the population over age 65 grows, the burden of AD is destined to grow in lockstep. Avoiding this fate requires
rethinking why existing efforts have been ineffective.
Although AD is a disease of aged human brains, many AD studies fail to parse aging from disease. We have
developed a system that lets us model aspects of human age in vitro: induced neurons (iNs). Once matured,
neurons of the brain never again replicate their genome or divide. As such, post-mitotic neurons downregulate
cell-cycle mediated metabolic pathways used for the synthesis of DNA building blocks, deoxyribonucleotides
(dNTs) and become reliant on the salvage of ribonucleotides (rNTs). I asked if these fundamentally important
homeostatic processes are maintained over the human lifespan or in AD. Multiple experimental approaches on
iNs derived from 13 sporadic AD (sAD) patients against 13 cognitively normal, age-match individuals (CN),
revealed dramatic differences in NT pools, with a significant increase in rNTs in CNs relative to young healthy
iNs. This effect was even further exacerbated in AD iNs. I ask here if the dramatic increases in rNTs result in
increased ribo-substitution in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, thus promoting increased DNA damage and
bioenergetic dysfunction in age and AD. Further, I observed significant differential expression of key cell cycle
and metabolic genes such as CDK1 and RRM1, which I have confirmed at the protein level. Our proposal, for
the first time, incorporates long noted pathological observations of chromosomal instability and presence of
cell-cycle markers in AD into a testable model system that provides a mechanistic basis for the development of
sporadic AD.
In addition to the critical scientific advances this proposal aims to achieve, I will also contribute new powerful
new tools and datasets to the fields of aging and AD. I have adapted our recently developed repair-seq
technology to quantify ribo-substitution in aged and AD iNs. I will further map epigenetic drift over the human
lifespan in neurons and quantify the neuronal capacity to generate new methyl groups for non-genetic
regulation of transcription."

Data demonstrate that transplanted kidneys from African American (AA) deceased donors are associated with
reduced survival relative to kidneys from non-AA donors. Additional data demonstrate that the presence of two
APOL1 risk variants, that are found exclusively in AA individuals, have been associated with an increased risk
of CKD/ESRD in the general AA population. Two risk variants of this gene have a prevalence of 13% in AAs and
may account for some or all of the increased risk of transplant loss. There are also anecdotal reports of AA living
kidney donors with two APOL1 risk variants developing ESRD raising further concerns. In the first phase of the
APOLLO study recipients of kidneys from deceased or living AA kidney donors were enrolled in a multi-center
observational study to definitively address the impact of APOL1 variants on kidney transplant outcomes and
donor health. The Emory APOLLO Clinical Consortium (CC8) is comprised of 5 transplant programs located in
Georgia and Texas. Based on geography and referral patterns these programs consistently provide transplant
care to a large population of AAs. As an example, the most recent Program Specific Report released by the
SRTR demonstrated that in 2021 65.2% of the individuals waitlisted at the Emory Transplant Center were AAs
(versus 31.8% nationally) and 65.6% of the transplants performed were in AA recipients (versus 33.7%
nationally). In phase I of the APOLLO study CC8 enrolled 212 recipients of kidneys from AA donors representing
8.6% of the total enrollment of the 13 clinical centers and 4 core programs that comprise the APOLLO study.
We have collected and submitted DNA samples for APOL1 genotyping from 100% of these recipients and have
collected initial of blood and urine study specimens from 98.4% and 96.9% of these recipients respectively. We
have also collected study-specified clinical and demographic data from 97% of these recipients. In the proposed
second phase of the APOLLO study, we will extend the follow up of enrolled subjects through the 4th year of the
award. This will require all subjects to be reconsented allowing us to collect new biosamples of blood and urine
as well as the collection of clinical data and measurements of renal function and proteinuria. We will also provide
the results of any transplant kidney biopsies performed on enrolled recipients and unstained biopsy slides for
future studies. We are confident that our continued contributions to the APOLLO consortium will contribute to
the study's ultimate aim of defining the role of APOL1 risk variants in the long-term outcomes of kidney
transplantation and living kidney donation."
10731737,"Project summary: Obesity is a global public health issue. A number of chemicals precipitate amenorrhea,
premature menopause and infertility in females. Affected women experience chronic, permanent health effects
since the proportion of their life spent post-menopause is lengthened, thereby increasing the likelihood of
associated health complication development (including coronary heart disease, obesity, type II diabetes,
osteoporosis and depression). Reproductive dysfunction also results from obesity and we have published a
number of studies demonstrating that the ovary of an obese female has heightened sensitivity to chemical
exposures that induce ovarian damage and infertility. This increased sensitivity arises from altered abundance
of chemical metabolism proteins within the ovary and raises concern about increased risk to obese women of
environmental chemical exposures that target the ovary.
 Our strong published and preliminary data support that the ovary of obese females have altered chemical
metabolism in addition to a blunted DNA repair response when exposed to chemicals that cause DNA damage.
This is concerning since DNA damage can lead to loss of fertility in females or represent a risk to offspring
health should this damage be improperly repaired. Indeed, offspring of obese women have increased rates of
birth defects. We have demonstrated our findings in adult post-pubertal mice, however, whether these impacts
are also noted in females who experience an obese environment during gestation or pre-pubertally remains

 The ongoing theme of this program is to study the virus-cell interactions that affect HSV gene
expression, with the primary focus on the mechanisms that regulate viral and cellular transcription during the
course of infection. Progress during the last funding period has provided new insights into how the genes of
HSV are transcribed in a regulated cascade during the course of viral infection. The studies also showed how
viral processes and molecules can interact with and possibly regulate cellular transcription. We propose to
extend on these studies and investigate new virus-cell interactions that affect virus and cell transcription.
Ultimately, knowledge of how HSV genes are transcribed, and the virus-cell interactions that contribute to their
regulated expression, may allow for strategies to block activated transcription and hence virus multiplication.
 The HSV genome during productive infection is a much more dynamic structure than classic cellular
chromatin. The viral nucleoprotein allows for the rapid progression through the infectious cycle so that by 3hpi,
all the events that must occur on the viral genome to produce new virus can be observed. This includes events
that contribute to the shutoff of host cell transcription. This renewal focuses on virus-cell interactions occurring
on the cellular (aim 1) and viral (aim 2) genomes, as well as the utilization of a cellular complex by the virus
that is crucial for all pol II transcription, the mediator (aim 3). We have shown that the major viral regulatory
protein, ICP4, binds to promoter/start-site regions of specific cellular genes early in infection as a function of
the epigenetic state of the cell. The first aim will investigate the mechanism of interaction between ICP4 and
the cellular genome, determine how ICP4 affects its expression, and explore the possibility that it functions
differently in different cell types. The second will focus on the structure of the viral genome, and how viral
proteins, including ICP4, affect the accessibility of the genome, and hence viral transcription. During the last
funding period we showed that ICP4 interacts with and recruits a specific form of the mediator to the viral
genome. In the third aim we will further explore the ICP4-mediator interaction, and test a model for the
recruitment of mediator by ICP4 and its utilization for the activated and regulated transcription of viral genes.
To undertake these studies, we have developed and refined a set of proteomics and genomics tools to
specifically probe the dynamic state of viral genomes, and the viral and cellular proteins that associate with
them. These tools combined with virus genetics allows us to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of
processes occurring on the viral genome, including transcription."

The rapid emergence of antifungal drug resistance in Candida species poses a severe antimicrobial threat
worldwide. Azole antifungals, especially fluconazole, are widely used for treating Candida infections, however,
azoles induce genome changes in diverse Candida species and acquired resistance can rapidly emerge. Despite
this, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the molecular events that drive the acquisition of azole
resistance in real time. Previously, we identified that 50% of fluconazole resistant Candida albicans clinical
isolates are aneuploid and some of these aneuploidies cause pan-azole resistance. More recently, aneuploidy-
acquired fluconazole resistance has been observed in many diverse human fungal pathogens, yet despite the
frequency of these aneuploid events, the mechanism causing them is not known. We have developed cutting-
edge multidisciplinary approaches that uniquely position us to define the rate and mechanisms of acquired azole
resistance in a rigorous and reproducible way. These approaches include controlled in vitro and in vivo evolution,
comprehensive comparative genomics and bioinformatics techniques, and extensive molecular genetic
approaches. The aims of this application take a new approach to identifying the mechanisms driving antifungal
drug resistance. In aim 1, we will determine the impact of azole stress on the rate and dynamics of acquired
azole resistance. This will simultaneously enable us to identify novel and recurrent mechanisms of azole
resistance, aneuploidy-derived resistance mechanisms, and the extent to which these mutations cause pan-
azole and multi-drug resistance. In aim 2, the frequency of segmental chromosome aneuploidies known to cause
resistance across diverse clinical isolates will be determined both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the impact of
repetitive DNA sequences and DNA repair proteins on the formation of segmental aneuploidies will be
determined. Our work is significant because it will identify the frequency, order and trajectory of mutations as
they arise in a population and how these mutations cause antifungal drug resistance. Together the outcomes
from these studies will identify the mechanisms that underlie how C. albicans acquires resistance and can pave
the way for developing therapeutics to reduce the significant morbidity and mortality caused by diverse antifungal

Sound entering the cochlea induces a longitudinally propagating travelling wave along the cochlear partition
which includes the organ of Corti. The organ of Corti amplifies travelling waves via force production by outer hair
cells. Where this amplification is lost, an array of electrodes called a cochlear implant replaces sound stimulation
with electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve. Improved cochlear implants combine electrical and sound
stimulation in patients with some intact hearing. These combined implants lead to improved performance.
However, approximately half of combined cochlear implant recipients experience a loss of their remaining
hearing months after implantation. This implantation-induced hearing loss reduces speech recognition and
musicality.
Implantation-induced hearing loss may have multiple interacting causes; immune, metabolic, and mechanical.
We hypothesize that cochlear scarring (fibrosis/ossification) induced by implantation disrupts travelling wave
propagation to the site of low frequency hearing. Links between hearing loss and implant-induced scarring are
seen in rodent models, reflecting clinical findings. However, there are no direct measurements of the mechanical
consequences of cochlear implantation for low frequency hearing.
We will combine our expertise with rodent models of cochlear implantation and the use of the latest generation
of imaging interferometry – optical coherence tomography (OCT). In a bid to produce the first data of its kind, we
will use OCT vibrometry to characterize low frequency mechanical function in the cochlear apex of chronically
implanted animals. We will then produce a 3D map of the scarring inside each cochlea using OCT imaging.
Coupled with histology and machine learning powered image analysis, we will compare the extent, location and
type of scarring with organ of Corti gain, tuning, distortion, phase and group delay in each cochlea. The results of
our OCT vibrometry experiments will be interpreted by computer models of cochlear function. Experiments will also be
conducted in acutely implanted models to assess the effect of the cochlear implant upon apical mechanics
prior to scarring. Additionally, we will use a model with noise induced hearing loss prior to implantation to test the
contribution of high frequency outer hair cells to low frequency hearing performance.
Our multidisciplinary team will offer a direct insight into cochlear implant-induced hearing loss and will allow us
to test the scarring hypothesis. This project will guide avenues of research geared towards minimizing or
preventing cochlear implant-induced hearing loss, and lead to improved quality of life for the recipients of
cochlear implants."
10861752,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an urgent need to identify novel treatment targets for cocaine use disorder (CUD), as pharmacological
treatments have largely failed. The goal of this award is to evaluate the effects of transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) on electroencephalogram (EEG) markers of reward functioning in adults with CUD. This goal
will be met by the research strategy and a rigorous training plan for Dr. Webber, who is uniquely positioned to
utilize electroencephalogram to assess TMS effects on the brain in CUD. Building on Dr. Webber's expertise in
cognitive neuroscience, electrophysiology, and addiction, the current career development plan will provide
training in: 1) transcranial magnetic stimulation research and clinical application, 2) advanced time-frequency-
based approach to electroencephalogram analysis, and 3) running an independent clinical trial. This training
will put Dr. Webber at the forefront of TMS development and mechanism identification for substance use
disorders and will position Dr. Webber as an independent investigator in addiction neuroscience. While TMS
has shown early success for treating CUD, there are important, yet addressable issues for optimizing TMS
treatment. First, the majority of studies have stimulated dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, yet many areas of the
prefrontal cortex are hypoactive in chronic cocaine use. Second, it is vital to identify reliable biomarkers to
identify targets for treatment and alternative end points in clinical trials. Electrophysiological markers (Reward
Positivity and Late Positive Potential) of reward sensitivity and motivated attention toward drug cues, two
factors that hinder treatment success and increase risk for relapse, hold promise for TMS manipulation. Third,
heterogeneity in TMS effects still need to be explained, which can lead to the improvement of individualized
treatment. The current study will compare a novel site, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, to both sham and
traditional dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a 3-arm, within-subjects, cross-over design to assess the acute
effects of TMS administration on the Reward Positivity and Late Positive Potential. This proof-of-concept study
will provide critical information on whether TMS administration has the potential to manipulate important reward
functioning deficits observed in CUD. This will be accomplished by: 1) Assessing the effects of TMS to the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to sham on the time-frequency
aspects of the Reward Positivity, 2) Assessing the effects of TMS to the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to sham on the Late Positive Potential, and 3) Identifying individual
differences in TMS effects with baseline characteristics (CUD severity, impulsivity, and craving). This work will
contribute to increasing knowledge of TMS in CUD and provide a strong foundation for the design and
submission of an R01 application in Year 5 of the K01 training, thereby launching Dr. Webber's progression
toward an independent research career. Ultimately, this work will lead to the development of optimal brain
stimulation procedures to treat CUD and other substance use disorders."
10744749,"Abstract
Tumor cells arise upon escape from two distinct and critical barriers that limit proliferation of human cells,
replicative senescence and crisis. Cells in replicative senescence arrest permanently while continuing to
metabolize, triggered by short telomeres. Senescence entry however, is avoided by impairment of the main cell
cycle checkpoints controlled by the p53 and Rb tumor suppressive pathways. Following senescence bypass and
continued proliferation, cells undergo crisis, which is a phase highlighted by substantial telomere deprotection
and widespread cell death. Crisis is a stringent tumor-suppressive barrier, as it removes the vast majority of cells
that avoid senescence. However, rarely cells overcome this barrier and become neoplastic. The molecular
mechanisms and pathways underlying cell death in crisis and spontaneous crisis evasion are not understood.
Here, it is proposed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the escape from crisis and crisis bypass,
with the expectation that the resulting discoveries will have a strong impact on our understanding of the early
steps in cancer development. The preliminary data presented here suggest a novel concept for replicative crisis
that implicates autophagy as a major regulator of cell death. Autophagy suppression allowed cells to bypass
crisis and continue to proliferate, while accumulating multiple genomic aberrations. This discovery is of profound
significance for understanding how genome instability evolves during the early steps of cancer development.
Furthermore, the finding suggests that autophagy inhibitors might have counterproductive effects and promote
the establishment of neoplastic cells instead of eliminating them. In three specific aims it is proposed to decipher
the exact signaling pathways that lead from dysfunctional telomeres to the activation of autophagy-controlled
cell death (Aim 1), to determine the consequences of telomere-driven autophagy and of autophagy inhibition
during crisis (Aim 2), and to understand the role of autophagy-driven cell death in crisis on tumor development
in vivo (Aim 3). In summary, this grant proposal focuses on the mechanisms underlying cell death during
replicative crisis, the mechanism of how autophagy is activated and regulated in response to replicative crisis,
and how inhibition of autophagy during crisis enables cells with an unstable genome to escape this final barrier
against tumor cell establishment and drive malignancy. We will thereby explore our novel hypothesis, in which
temporary or permanent resistance to autophagic cell death is the initial event required for the emergence of
post-crisis cells and an abrupt rise in genome instability, leading to the establishment of neoplastic cells."
10744750,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is the expansion of leukocytes derived from a
clone with pre-leukemic potential that does not fulfill diagnostic criteria for a hematologic malignancy. Recent
large-scale studies have demonstrated an association between mutations in CHIP genes, mostly in TET2,
DNMT3A, ASXL1, and a 30-40% increased risk of non-cancer mortality, a 2-fold increased risk of ischemic
stroke and coronary artery disease (CAD), and a cumulative increase in cardiovascular (CV) death in the
general population. Mechanistic models propose a phenotypic switch in immune cells, chiefly macrophages,
with CHIP mutations leading to increased vascular inflammation and accelerated CAD. Despite these
data suggesting that CHIP is significantly associated with increased CV events and overall mortality, it is
unknown whether CHIP is associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD), the most feared manifestation of CVD.
Our NHLBI-funded ongoing POST SCD Study, which has autopsied 97% of >1000 consecutive SCDs since
2011, is the first and only prospective unselected adult SCD cohort to use autopsy to refine the SCD
phenotype to true cardiac and arrhythmic causes. We recently reported that nearly half of conventionally-
defined presumed SCDs were in fact non-cardiac. Importantly, the large-scale exome sequencing studies that
initially defined the carrier rates and risk of a cardiovascular event relied on presumed causes of death and
often assessed for the presence of CHIP years prior to death.
 Our central hypothesis is that CHIP-mutant resident macrophages increase the risk of fatal
arrhythmias across all underlying substrates of SCD found in POST SCD (CAD, hypertrophy, CM) by
increasing interstitial myocardial fibrosis and decreasing electrical coupling. We will test this hypothesis by: (1)
determining the population carrier rate of CHIP at the time of SCD and its associated independent risk, (2)
establish that CHIP increases the infiltration of macrophages and interstitial fibrosis within the cardiac
interstitium, including the conduction system, and (3) define the transcriptional mechanism by which CHIP
macrophages increase vulnerable myocardial substrate for SCD. We anticipate that this innovative approach
will yield the following outcomes: (1) inform potential clinical use of CHIP for SCD risk stratification; (2)
establish the role of macrophages on myocardium and conduction system beyond the vascular compartment
and its correlation with fibrotic arrhythmogenic substrate common to all sub-phenotypes of SCD, and the
modulating effect of CHIP on this process; (3) determine the RNA profiles of CHIP-mutant resident
macrophages vs. wildtype macrophages to reveal insights into CHIP-specific effects on the cellular milieu of
hearts vulnerable to SCD to thus potentially identify new biologic targets for diagnosis and/or therapeutics.
Thus, the proposed research will fundamentally advance our knowledge of how CHIP increases CV mortality,
specifically SCD, and potentially identify a new risk factor for SCD."

The goal of this study is to define cell-specific regulatory networks and key drivers of cellular response to beryllium
(Be) that result in the granulomatous lung disease, chronic beryllium disease (CBD), at the site of organ
involvement. Relying on the complementary, unique expertise of investigative team we will define pathogenic
pathways and risk factors for CBD, its precursor (Be sensitization; BeS) and similar environmentally induced
diseases. Exposure to an inhaled Be antigen(s), in the setting of a genetically susceptible host, initiates a Th1
immune response, with antigen presentation occurring via HLA Class II on antigen presenting cell (APC) in the
context of CD4+ T cells. Subsequently, CD4+ T cells and APCs are recruited to the lung, proliferate, produce
cytokines and chemokines, and eventually form granulomas. An increased prevalence of HLA-DPB1 alleles with
a glutamic acid at amino acid position 69 (E69) is found in CBD and BeS, although this variant is found in up to
40% of Be exposed workers without BeS or CBD, suggesting that other factors or forms of genetic regulation are
important in disease pathogenesis. Growing data in other immune-mediated diseases suggests that epigenetic
mechanisms in combination with genetic susceptibility and environment may help explain disease risk. Epigenetic
modifications determine T cell and APC/macrophage differentiation and the ensuing immune response through
DNA methylation and histone modifications of key genes and thus impact health and disease. Our previous work
demonstrated DNA methylation changes associated with alterations in gene expression and disease state in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells of CBD subjects compared to BeS and controls, including pivotal immune
response genes and networks. Single cell sequencing technologies have emerged as a key method to
characterize novel cell population and cell-specific changes in gene expression. Based on this information, our
hypothesis is that exposure to Be alters epigenetic marks, impacting gene expression and immune cell
differentiation in cell-specific manner, and ultimately risk of granulomatous lung disease. We will test this
hypothesis through three specific aims, focusing mainly on macrophages and CD4+ T cells but acknowledging
that other cell populations are important and considering them in alternative approaches and future directions. In
Aim 1 we will characterize the lung immune cell response to Be exposure using single cell ATAC-seq and CITE-
seq to measure chromatin accessibility, gene expression levels and protein epitopes at four timepoints to define
key drivers in specific cell populations. In Aim 2 we will validate the regulatory networks in uncultured lung
samples, focusing on macrophages and CD4+ Tcells, using bulk ATAC- Me and RNA-sequencing. We will
functionally validate the results from our multi-omic analysis from Aims 1 and 2 using CRSIPR-dCas9 to change
methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression at loci identified as key drivers of response to Be in
cultured macrophage and T cell lines in Aim 3. Ultimately, this proposal will enhance our understanding of the
novel genes, regulatory pathways and networks, and molecular mechanisms involved in CBD etiology."

Endothelial cells (EC) mount distinct cellular responses to signaling inputs as primitive vessel networks expand via
sprouting angiogenesis. This heterogeneity in cellular behaviors is achieved by differential signaling of key
pathways such as VEGF-A and BMP. Underlying differences in signaling is EC heterogeneity at the level of gene
expression and post-translational protein regulation. We define EC heterogeneity as distinct cellular behaviors in
response to either molecular or mechanical signals, accompanied by variation in expression profiles and regulation
of key pathway regulators. My lab has contributed to understanding how VEGF-A and BMP signaling contribute to
EC heterogeneity and how Notch co-ordinates these pathways. Heterogeneity is lost as vessels respond to flow-
mediated signals and remodel, and vessels “reactivate” to sprout and form new networks during physiological
wound healing. These observations lead to several questions whose answers will impact our basic understanding
of blood vessel formation and function, and help understand cardiovascular diseases. Our goals going forward are
to investigate developmental EC heterogeneity, to examine how heterogeneity is lost as vessels remodel to
homeostasis, and to test the novel hypothesis that reactivation of developmental EC heterogeneity contributes to
wound healing angiogenesis. We will use both models and tools that we've developed and successfully used to
date, and also incorporate new state-of-the-art approaches and tools to extend the impact of our findings beyond
early sprouting angiogenesis. Our over-arching hypothesis is that EC heterogeneity is promoted by low or absent
flow-induced shear stress, and repressed when shear stress reaches a critical threshold(s) by transitions in
regulation of signaling pathways. We further posit that wound healing angiogenesis is promoted by reduced shear
stress downstream inflammation-induced tortuous vessel formation. We will focus on the respective roles of VEGF-
A and BMP signaling in these processes. This new knowledge will fill critical gaps in our knowledge of how EC
achieve this remarkable transition from heterogeneous outputs to homeostasis to reactivation. This new knowledge,
in turn, will allow us and others to examine more precisely how dysregulation of EC transitions contributes to
disease."

At the root of every human genetic disease lies molecular dysfunction of a biological process or protein
complex. Conversely, proteins interacting in the same biochemical complex are often linked to similar genetic
traits. Despite the revolution in high throughput biology, the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic
diseases remain only partly known. Previous studies have shown that highly conserved (ancient) proteins are
abundant across human cell types and tissues and are enriched for disease associations. My research aims to
exploit these trends by determining the most conserved protein interactions across the eukaryotic tree of life,
based on an analysis of available large scale proteomics data, and using this information to suggest new
candidate genes for diverse human diseases.
A large portion of these deeply conserved disease-associated proteins are traceable to the last eukaryotic
common ancestor (LECA), an ancestral organism that lived ~2 billion years ago. My own preliminary data
suggests that ~9,700 genes in the human genome can be dated back to LECA. Importantly, these deeply
conserved genes are responsible for a large and diverse subset of major human diseases, spanning
developmental disorders (e.g., Noonan syndrome, Leigh syndrome, microcephaly, neural tube defects),
cancers (e.g., leukemia, breast cancer, colorectal cancer), chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., ciliary dyskinesia,
asthma), neurological disorders (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, encephalopathy, schizophrenia, autism)
and motor problems (e.g., dystonia, spastic paraplegia).
My lab has collected and assembled protein interaction data for ~30 evolutionarily diverse eukaryotic
organisms. These data directly measure tens of thousands of protein interactions in each species. I propose
developing a draft map of the multiprotein assemblies that date back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.
This unprecedented effort represents a synthesis of >20,000 mass spectrometry experiments, and thus will
require significant programming skill, statistical know-how, and computational resources. Using guilt-by-
association, I will then associate new candidate genes with diseases based on these conserved interactions. I
will concurrently verify the use of deep protein complex conservation as a way to associate genes with
diseases by functionally characterizing two novel proteins we previously observed to interact with Dnai2.
Defects in Dnai2 are known to cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, a subtype of ciliopathy marked by defects in
motile cilia; thus, these two novel proteins are also likely ciliopathy genes and may contribute to primary ciliary
dyskinesia."
10744781,"An R25 Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) for under-represented minority (URM) students
will be developed at Michigan State University (MSU). It will provide a 12 wk beginning research experience in
environmental toxicology and health, with emphasis on the mechanisms of action of environmental toxicants,
for 7/yr undergraduate students science majors after their 1st or 2nd yr of class work; 4 positions will be set
aside for these students. The remaining positions will be available to any student. A minimum of 5 positions/yr
will be allocated for URM students. The focus is on 1st time research experience on hypothesis-directed
projects related to environmental health. The ultimate goal is to encourage URM students to enroll in Ph.D.
programs in environmental health or allied biomedical sciences. There are three objectives. The first and
principal objective is to provide an intensive experience in hypothesis-directed research on projects relevant to
the NIEHS mission, as this is often the critical first step to launching a student into a successful graduate
career. A 2nd objective is to enhance students’ communication skills, especially with respect to scientific
presentations. The third objective is to develop a sense of mentored community. Students will supplement the
research experience with a series of social and professional development opportunities. A one-week long
“bootcamp” entitled “Introduction to Laboratory Research” will precede the student beginning their project. It
will serve as a foundation to provide a cohesive introduction to the fundamental aspects of working in a lab.
The proposed SURE program leverages partnerships developed by the PI with two undergraduate institutions
in the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) system - UPR-Cayey and UPR-Arecibo, as well as minority serving
institutions (MSIs) in the Southwest. Each of these institutions lacks significant research opportunities. These
partnerships have resulted in 17 Hispanic students entering Ph.D. programs in biomedical sciences over the
past 5 years. Recruiting will involve visits to the campuses by the PI, and will be coupled with a seminar
exposing the students to concepts in environmental health sciences. Summer research projects will be in
federally-funded labs of PIs with research interests in environmental toxicology and health. Enrichment
activities will include the weekly informal presentations on students research, discussion of career
opportunities and ethical aspects of research; a final oral and poster presentation will be required. These
activities will improve students’ presentation skills and help them focus on the “bigger picture” of translational
biomedical sciences. Students will be encouraged to attend national scientific meetings to present their
research. Ideally, these meetings will also have career development/educational activities for undergrads such
as those at the Society of Toxicology meeting. This will further students’ exposure to environmental toxicology
and health, allow them to network, and develop a sense of community with other URM undergrads. A long-
term outcome is increasing the number of URM scientists in the biomedical/environmental health sciences."

Aging is associated with impaired stress resilience defined as a loss of the ability of cells, organs, and organisms
to adapt to physiological or pathological stressors. Evidence suggests that this loss of resilience arises before
any overt pathology, and eventually contributes to the loss of function, disease, and death. However, the cellular
mechanisms that drive this process are poorly understood. In order for cells to adapt to environmental and
endogenous stressors they need to be able to communicate the stress signal through signal transduction
mechanisms. However, in order for transient stress signals to be effective, they should be low under resting
conditions. The Nrf2 antioxidant response element activates early changes in gene expression to enhance redox
protective mechanisms in response to acute redox stress associated with muscle contraction. In healthy
individuals this leads to an adaptive response to restore redox balance and increased cellular resilience to future
stresses. We have found that Nrf2 is chronically activated under basal conditions and has an attenuated
response to muscle contraction in human aged skeletal muscle. In addition, we have found that aging is
associated with elevated reversible oxidation of the thiol proteome, a primary signal transduction mechanism
driving redox adaptation, and that reducing mitochondrial redox stress restores the thiol proteome to that found
in young adults. Here we hypothesize that mitochondrial redox stress in aging muscle is the chronic low-level
stress that impairs the signal transduction communication in the cell underlying the impaired Nrf2 response to
muscle contraction. Aim 1 tests whether decreasing mitochondrial redox stress in aged or increasing
mitochondrial redox stress in young improves or impairs the Nrf2 activation to acute muscle contraction. Aim 2
tests whether the manipulation of mitochondrial redox stress and basal Nrf2 activation improves the adaptive
responses to exercise training in aged mice. This research uses skeletal muscle contraction as a model to
generate new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying reduced resilience with age. A more complete
mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon will provide therapeutic targets for aging and disease by
identifying stressors that are necessary and sufficient to drive the aging process."

Human aging and the myriad of age-associated diseases are among the greatest challenges in our healthcare
system and result in a significant economic burden. Thus, finding interventions that prevent, postpone, or even
reverse age-related phenotypes are urgently needed. As aging is a complex, multifactorial process, targeting
multiple pathways simultaneously are likely needed to optimally slow the aging process and prevent age-
related disease. To this end, recent studies in animal models now indicate that combination of more than one
gerotherapeutic can indeed enhance health and lifespan to a greater extent than monotherapies. Building on
this concept, our proposed studies will utilize combination therapies involving several promising life-extending
compounds all of which will be evaluated in combination with the growth hormone receptor antagonist (GHRA).
GHRA is the primary focus of this proposal for several reasons: i) a strong body of evidence shows that
reduction in GH action is associated with slowed aging; ii) disruption of GH action was found to extend lifespan
in laboratory mice longer than any other method; iii) pharmaceutical inhibition of the GH/IGF-1 axis has been
identified as the first of six most promising interventions to slow aging in a recent consensus statement of
aging experts; iv) recent data show increases in median and maximal lifespan in female mice expressing
GHRA; v) GHRA (Somavert, pegylated GHRA) is the only FDA approved drug that specifically targets GH
action and has been shown to be safe and effective in humans; and vi) GHR antagonism has not been
properly evaluated for aging research alone or in combination with other gerotherapeutic agents despite its
clear promise as a gerotherapeutic drug. Thus, we hypothesize that combining GHR antagonism with other
life-extending compounds will improve health and longevity to a greater extent than these individual therapies
alone. In Aim 1, we seek to test novel combination therapies involving GHR antagonism for the first time. In
Aim 2, we seek to understand the mechanistic changes that occur with these novel combinations. An intriguing
role for GH in altering age-associated B cells – which has not previously been linked to GH action and is more
recently appreciated to be important in aging-related pathologies – will also be assessed. Our long-term goal
is to develop novel, mechanism-based, therapeutic approaches for attenuating the aging process in humans.
In this proposal, feasible clinical combinations that employ existing nutraceuticals and FDA approved drugs will
be given top consideration. As each of these compounds have their own unique limitations (i.e., show mild
improvements individually, influence different aging pathways, can be sex-specific), their combination should
target multiple aging-associated pathways simultaneously to maximize health and longevity."
10893568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As we get older, we learn to modulate our behaviors to optimize reward outcomes. These adaptive choices are
orchestrated by current sensory conditions, internal cognitive states, and future expectations. In adolescence,
rewards circuits that link peripheral detection of sensory stimuli to central circuits involved in decision-making
and motivational states continue to grow, remodeling the microcircuit connectivity within the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC). This development may explain why adolescents demonstrate increased impulsivity and
diminished behavioral flexibility, and fail to optimize reward outcomes. However, the developmental changes
within the reward circuits that inform differences in reward learning during adolescence are poorly understood.
The mPFC is a key area for emotional regulation, decision making, and reward-seeking. The reward-
modulating properties of mPFC are derived from inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA). During
adolescence, VTA inputs into mPFC are still developing, and the functional impact of these developmental
changes is unknown. One influential theory suggests that increased dopaminergic (DA) signaling in
adolescence drives heightened reward sensitivity. However, additional mechanisms such as changes in local
mPFC connectivity and changes in reward information sent to the mPFC are likely at play. In this proposal, we
use a combination of chemogenetics, optogenetics, anatomical, and neural calcium imaging, to test how the
developing adolescent mPFC (Aim 1) and VTA projections to mPFC (Aim 2) contribute to adolescent reward
behaviors and influence reward optimization strategies (Aim 3). This work reframes the role of neuronal
subtypes, and probes if their role in a given behavior is shaped by the age of the microcircuit, asking the
question, do cells carry the same information in adolescents as they do in adulthood? In addition to the value
of this work from a basic science perspective, this study is likely to produce testable hypotheses that will tackle
why certain psychiatric disorders such as impulse control and feeding disorders tend to emerge during
adolescence. Training in calcium imaging, neuronal activity data analysis and advanced anatomical techniques
will be provided by the mentor Dr. Conor Liston, with additional expertise in 2-photon imaging provided by the
consultants Drs. Rajasethupathy and De Marco Garcia. Dr. Sullivan will serve as a consultant on
developmental behavioral neuroscience, providing feedback on experimental design and outcomes. Dr. Bravo
Rivera will provide an additional behavioral neuroscientific perspective and will be instrumental in providing
additional career development training to the applicant. Together the mentor and the External Advisory
Committee will facilitate the transition of Dr. Manzano Nieves into an independent research career focused on
uncovering how postnatal development alters brain circuits to bias behavior and create psychiatric
vulnerabilities."

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common inherited cardiac muscle disease with an estimated 750,000
affected individuals in the United States. However, only about 100,000 people have been diagnosed, suggesting
that there are significant diagnostic and treatment gaps for individuals with pre-clinical or overt disease, as well
as for their at-risk family members. Therefore, it is important to identify individuals who should undergo evaluation
for earlier diagnosis and targeted treatment, prior to the development of highly morbid outcomes including heart
failure, arrhythmias, stroke, and sudden death. The electronic health record offers a source of high dimensional,
longitudinal phenotype information that can be leveraged to create more sensitive and specific diagnostic
algorithms. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Nosheen Reza aims to
improve the ability to identify individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy through creation and evaluation of
machine learning classification models that leverage electronic health record data derived from diverse
populations. In Aim 1, she will derive and validate a multi-institutional electrocardiogram-based model for the
detection of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using data from the Penn Medicine electronic health record and will
evaluate whether the addition of additional electronic health record-derived traits to this model improves the
model's ability to detect patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In Aim 2, she will externally validate the best
performing electronic health record-derived models in two large independent health systems. In Aim 3, she will
use implementation science methods to identify clinician-specific barriers to and facilitators of accurate and
timely diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and assess clinicians' attitudes toward the use of an electronic
health record-derived diagnostic model for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Taken together, these aims will lead to
prospective dissemination and implementation studies of a generalizable electronic health record-derived
diagnostic tool to facilitate early recognition and risk stratification of individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Dr. Reza, an early career investigator and genetic and advanced heart failure cardiologist, has a long-term goal
of becoming an independently funded cardiovascular data scientist with a focus on applying clinical informatics
tools that leverage electronic health record and genomic data to enable precision medicine in the care of patients
with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. This K23 award will support Dr. Reza in achieving this goal through a
comprehensive and rigorous training plan in bioinformatics, machine learning, and implementation science. Dr.
Reza will be supervised by an outstanding mentorship and advisory team at the University of Pennsylvania
consisting of national leaders in genetic cardiomyopathies, electronic health record-based research, and
translational bioinformatics. The mentored research and career development plan outlined in this proposal will
guide Dr. Reza's transition to an independently funded research career."
10919847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleep irregularity is highly prevalent and linked to downstream adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes, but
the upstream drivers of sleep irregularity are not well characterized. Adverse health outcomes associated with
irregular sleep timing mirror those linked to shift work, and irregular sleep may represent a driver of circadian
misalignment and related disease in the general population. Notably, sleep timing is modifiable and could
serve as an inexpensive, non-invasive way to promote health, but further research on environmental factors
influencing sleep regularity is required to inform successful interventions. Understanding the environmental
drivers and molecular markers of irregular sleep are critical gaps that would aid public health intervention and
disease prevention efforts.
The recent 2021 NIH Sleep Research Plan highlights research on the effects of environmental exposures on
sleep and on epigenetic mechanisms underlying sleep and circadian health as top priorities. Therefore, to
address these gaps in knowledge and stated research needs, I propose to apply acquired training in sleep
epidemiology, chronobiology, and advanced statistical analysis and epigenetics to: 1) investigate which
dimensions of light exposure impact sleep regularity and moderation by factors such as age and sex (K99), 2)
develop biological markers of sleep regularity (K99), 3) validate and establish the temporality of resulting
findings with prospectively collected data (R00), and 4) expand measurement of light and environmental
factors with prospectively collected data (R00).
My goal is to establish an independent research program centered around how light and other environmental
exposures affect sleep and chronobiology in population health. This proposed study and career development
plan logically builds upon my training in environmental health, vision research, and molecular epidemiology, to
gain expertise in light data analysis and collection, sleep epidemiology, chronobiology, advanced statistical
modeling, and omics integration. With expert mentored guidance provided by Dr. Tamar Sofer, Dr. Susan
Redline, and Dr. Frank Scheer, I will establish a unique interdisciplinary research program focusing on the
interactions of the light environment and sleep. This award will provide key training in four areas: 1) sleep
epidemiology; 2) clinical chronobiology; 3) integration and analysis of high-dimensional light and actigraphy
data with omics data; and 4) professional development. This data collected during the R00 phase will also
provide a strong foundation for R01 applications. This support provided by this award will allow me to launch a
novel independent research program and address inherent gaps in our understanding of the role of naturalistic
light exposure on sleep health in the general population."
10894889,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects roughly 12 million Americans and accounts for over $21 billion in
combined annual healthcare costs. Patients with PAD are at an increased risk of future cardiovascular events,
including amputation, myocardial infarction, and death. Patients with PAD who undergo a peripheral vascular
intervention (PVI) for claudication symptoms or for lower extremity ulcers or gangrene have a guideline-based
indication to be on multiple evidence-based medications. These medications include high intensity statins,
aspirin, a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel), and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin
receptor blocker (ARB). Adherence to these medications after PVI can significantly reduce the future risk of
amputation, myocardial infarction, and/or death. However, observational data of patients with PAD after PVI has
demonstrated poor medication adherence to these evidence-based medications. Additionally, there has been
no prior examination of the barriers and facilitators of medication adherence in this population of patients.
Moreover, there is little evidence regarding strategies to improve medication adherence in this vulnerable
population of patients. This proposal seeks to identify the barriers and facilitators of medication adherence in a
population of patients with PAD who have undergone PVI, and to develop a medication adherence tool to
promote discussion of and mitigation of barriers to adherence in the outpatient clinic environment. In Aim 1, we
will conduct semi-structured interviews of 40 patients with PAD who have undergone PVI to examine barriers
and facilitators of medication adherence. In Aim 2, we will then use evidence-based quality improvement
methods and a diverse research engagement panel, consisting of providers, patients, nurses, and experts in
information technology, to develop a medication adherence tool for use in the outpatient clinic. This tool will be
integrated into the electronic health record and will facilitate discussion of barriers to adherence and potential
strategies for improving adherence. In Aim 3, we will perform a pilot feasibility randomized controlled trial of 200
patients in two sites within the Duke Health System to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the adherence
tool, as well as the effect of the intervention on rates of medication adherence. This pilot randomized controlled
trial will establish the foundation for a future, multi-center randomized controlled trial examining the use of the
tool to improve rates of adherence and clinical outcomes. This research will occur in the setting of a

Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of microtubule-associated tau is a pathological hallmark of tauopathies
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, tau abnormality correlates with neuronal loss and cognitive deficits better
than amyloid burden. There is increasing interest in the development of tau-targeting drugs, for AD as well as other
tauopathies. Developing effective tau-targeting drugs requires a deeper and broader understanding of the pathogenic
mechanisms of tau. Recent studies have revealed extensive tau interaction with mitochondrial proteins. Intriguingly,
studies in animal models and humans have uncovered a specific link between tau and mitochondrial complex-I (C-I)
dysfunction, although the exact mechanism is unclear. C-I is the largest multisubunit complex of the respiratory chain
containing 45 subunits in humans. Under normal physiological conditions, C-I catalyzes the oxidation of NADH to
NAD+, initiates the transfer of electrons along the electron transport chain (ETC) from NADH to ubiquinone,
accompanied by proton pumping to generate the gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane needed for ATP
production. Defective C-I is a frequent cause of mitochondrial dysfunction linked to human diseases. In addition to
bioenergetic failure, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is intimately associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
Various studies have implicated reverse electron transfer (RET) at C-I as the major site of mitochondrial ROS
production. Under certain thermodynamic conditions, for example when forward electron transport (FET) is blocked
or when succinate accumulates to high level, RET can occur along C-I, moving electrons from ubiquinol (CoQ10H2)
to NAD+, producing a significant amount of ROS (RET-ROS) in the process. RET-ROS has been linked to
physiological processes such as macrophage activation in response to bacterial infection. However, excessive RET-
ROS is implicated in disease conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion injury. Another outcome of RET is the
conversion of NAD+ to NADH, thereby decreasing NAD+ and lowering NAD+/NADH ratio, which has been linked to
aging and age-related diseases. In preliminary studies, we have shown that inhibition of RET by a small molecule
drug that targets NDUFS3, or partial knockdown of NDUFS3 by genetic means, extends lifespan and rescues age-
related disease phenotypes in fly models. Excitingly, our preliminary studies generated compelling evidence that
pharmacological inhibition of RET can rescue cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration and extend the lifespan of
tauopathy mouse models. The goal of this study is to use in vivo mouse models and human iPSC-derived neuronal
models to test our central hypothesis that RET is altered in tauopathy, that tau interacts with C-I components to affect
RET, and that pharmacological or genetic targeting of NDUFS3 can restore RET and offer neuroprotection. Despite
overwhelming evidence implicating defective mitochondria in general, and C-I in particular, in tauopathies,
mitochondria and C-I have not been the focus of therapeutic development targeting tauopathies. Positive outcomes
from this project will help validate RET at C-I as a viable therapeutic target and stimulate interests in the development
of RET modulators as drug candidates for the treatment of tauopathies and possibly other brain diseases."

This K08 Career Development Award details a 5-year training program to advance my career goal of becoming
an R01-funded physician-scientist focused on elucidating thrombotic mechanisms in myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPN) in order to find new treatment targets and improve care of MPN patients. During the award
period, I will continue developing expertise in mechanistic understanding of and models of thrombosis, acquire
new scientific skills, advance translational capabilities, and generate publications and data that will serve as the
foundation for a successful R01 application. Under the guidance of my primary mentor, Dr. Rafal Pawlinski, and
co-mentors, Drs. Jonathan Serody and Alison Moliterno, these training objectives will be met by a combination
of didactic course work, participation in seminar series, research experience, and mentoring by my advisory
committee. Dr. Nigel Key and Dr. Josef Prchal will serve as advisors on the proposal.
The scientific proposal is aimed at identifying thrombotic mechanisms in JAK2V617F-positive MPN. Thrombosis
remains the leading cause of mortality in the major MPN subtypes polycythemia vera and essential
thrombocythemia. Circulating blood cells are both increased in quantity and qualitatively abnormal in MPN.
Current treatment paradigms aim to normalize the number of circulating blood cells to improve blood rheology.
However, despite current therapies 25% of MPN patients will experience a thrombotic event after diagnosis.
Understanding the basis of thrombosis and developing primary and secondary prevention strategies are key
unmet needs in this field. Dr. Prchal and I recently reported that upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-
mediated gene expression in neutrophils of MPN patients associated with thrombosis history. Importantly, we
also found increased neutrophil gene expression of tissue factor (TF), the primary initiator of the extrinsic
pathway of coagulation. We extended this finding, demonstrating that MPN neutrophils possess TF
procoagulant activity. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is the primary physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis;
its gene expression was also increased in MPN patients. I therefore hypothesize that JAK2V617F-driven increases
of HIF activity leads to upregulation of TF and PAI-1, thereby increasing the risk of MPN thrombosis. In Aim 1,
I will use a mouse model of venous thrombosis (VT) to evaluate (1) the functional consequence of increasing
JAK2V617F transgene copies to VT, (2) the effect of HIF-1α or HIF-2α inhibition to VT, (3) the contribution of
JAK2V617F mutation in hematopoietic versus endothelial cells to VT, and (4) the effect of neutrophil TF to VT. In
Aim 2, I will evaluate the effect of 0, 1, or 2 JAK2V617F-mutated alleles on heterogeneity of neutrophil gene
expression in MPN patients using single cell RNA sequencing with overlayed single cell genotyping. The 2 Aims
are complementary but independent and will identify new targets for the prevention of MPN thrombosis and set
the stage for additional investigations."

47 million people worldwide are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a related form of dementia. In the US
alone, the annual health care costs for people with AD will exceed 1 trillion dollars by 2050. However, current
treatments do not robustly prevent disease progression. The major risk factors for the late-onset form of AD are
advanced age and possession of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE). Importantly, increasing data support
the hypothesis that latent herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection is also a risk factor, especially in combination
with the APOE4 allele. This suggests that current antivirals may halt or delay neurodegenerative disease
progression in APOE4 carriers who are infected with HSV-1. A major gap in the study of this association,
however, is the absence of an HSV infection model reflecting the complexity of long-term latent infection,
particularly in the context of APOE4 and AD. In our preliminary studies, we observed that HSV-1-infected APOE4
mice, compared to mock-infected APOE4 mice and HSV-1-infected WT mice, displayed robust spatial memory
deficits, as well as oxidative stress, iron dysregulation, and gliosis in the CNS when assessed 15 months post
infection (mpi), but not at 3 mpi. The objective of this proposal is to use this model, as well as complementary in
vitro models, to fully elucidate the effects of long-term latent HSV-1 infection, in the context of differential APOE
isoform expression, on brain function and AD pathogenesis. We will also assess whether treatment with a novel,
brain-penetrant antiviral medication can block these effects. We anticipate that the full study proposed herein
will uncover unique and important interactions between HSV-1 infection and APOE genotype in driving AD
pathogenesis, potentially leading to safe and effective new therapeutic strategies for preventing or slowing AD
in at-risk individuals."

Rational, structure-based immunogen design for HIV vaccine development has begun to deliver promising
results in both, pre-clinical non-human primate (NHP) and clinical studies such as the IAVI G001 phase I trial
[NCT03547245]. Moreover, advances in single cell RNAseq and electron microscopy-based polyclonal antibody
mapping (EMPEM) have enabled analysis of both vaccine and pathogen-induced antibody responses at
unprecedented resolution, further enabling rational vaccine design. EMPEM and single cell B cell analysis deliver
fundamentally different data formats that if properly integrated, can illuminate immune responses at
unprecedented detail. We recently extended the original negative stain EMPEM method, capable of
distinguishing polyclonal antibody epitope specificities and angle of approach, to high resolution cryoEM-based
EMPEM to yield molecular details of epitope-paratope interfaces. In the best cases we can derive some
sequence information for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from structural data, identify Vh/Vl
gene usage, and query databases of antibody BCR sequences to directly generate monoclonal antibodies. As
such, we can short cut the laborious efforts to generate epitope specific monoclonal antibodies using
conventional methods. These molecular details are critical for identifying how bona fide human germline bnAb
precursors engage germline targeting immunogens such as the V2 apex targeting Q23 immunogen. EMPEM is
also critical for evaluating polyclonal antibody responses in BCR knock-in mice that have been immunized with
germline targeting immunogens that are designed to prime and mature antibodies with specific features in CDRs
that resemble known broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The Structural Proteomics Core will be highly
integrated into all both Project 1 and 2 as well as the Animals and Data Cores within this P01 application,
providing unique structural data to evaluate, refine, and optimize multi-epitope germline targeting immunogens
for development as candidate HIV vaccines."
10852998,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in treatment in recent years, HIV is still responsible for more than half a million deaths
annually; new infections have, furthermore, continued to exceed the milestones set by public health institutions.
Recently, a number of candidate immunogens based on either germline targeting or epitope focusing have
moved to Phase 1 clinical trials. These developments in HIV vaccinology have been immensely aided by
improved technology for the generation of humanized mouse models, which can be used in iterative
immunogen design, early stage down-selection, and other important components of vaccine development.
Among those improvements include the multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 dual immunoglobulin heavy and light chain
knockins (KI) developed by the Batista lab. With this approach, mice with B cells bearing genuine human BCRs,
which can be produced in a matter of weeks. Here, the Batista lab proposes to use this approach and its
expertise in animal experiments to act as the Animal Model Core (AMC) for the Multi-Omics Vaccine Evaluation
(MOVE) Consortium. The AMC will develop up to six new KI lines based on MOVE's interrogation of the naïve
human B cell repertoire. The AMC will furthermore contribute its existing HIV models to immunization
experiments initiated by MOVE Project 1. Samples generated from murine lymph, spleen, and other tissues will
then be provided to MOVE Project 2 for immunocharacterization. The AMC will act as the fulcrum of prime and
boost stage immunogen, formulation, and regiment development and assessment."
10853000,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of an effective HIV vaccine remains a major challenge. Previous strategies for HIV vaccine
design aimed to elicit protective T cell responses, non-neutralizing antibodies, broadly neutralizing antibodies
(bnAbs), or some combination of the three but have failed to protect against infection. There is a growing
consensus that critical elements to a successful bnAb-based vaccine will be its ability to: i) efficiently activate
and expand multiple rare naïve bnAb-encoding B cell precursors; ii) immunofocus these B cell responses to
canonical, conserved bnAb epitopes on the HIV Env trimer and away from off-target epitopes; and iii) affinity-
mature these response to breadth by heterologous vaccinations. The study design proposed in this application
addresses each of the critical aspects of bnAb elicitation. The grant aims to elicit bnAbs by a novel strategy that
combines priming of HIV bnAb encoding rare B cell precursors by rationally designed germline-targeting trimer
immunogens and expand their breadth with diverse heterologous trimer boosts. The project 1 includes three
aims: Aim #1 will develop an HIV trimer immunogen that can target rare V2-apex and V3-glycan bnAb-encoding
precursor B cells. Using in-vitro directed reverse vaccine engineering platform, we will develop germline-targeting
priming immunogen that exhibits enhanced affinity for V2 apex and V3-glycan bnAb UCAs to utilize as a priming
immunogen to active rare bnAb B cell precursors to these sites. Aim #2 will investigate the priming efficiency of
GT-trimer immunogen delivered through various vaccine platforms, to in vivo activate V2-apex and V3-glycan
bnAb B cell precursors in various bnAb precursor expressing animal models. The aim is to generate a robust
epitope specific memory B cell response that could be further boosted toward breadth. Aim #3 will investigate
various boost strategies using newly designed diverse HIV trimers to expand the neutralization breadth of the
V2-apex and V3-glycan specific bnAb B cell responses. If successful, the study will be the first of its kind, would
represent a new paradigm for rational vaccine design strategies for HIV."
10853004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this Project is to apply advanced multi-omics techniques to comprehensively analyze humoral
immune responses to promising HIV vaccine immunogens. Our mission is to advance vaccine development by
extracting as much information as possible from each immunization trial to best inform the optimal design,
composition and delivery of a cohesive immunogen matrix that reliably induces broad, protective HIV immunity.
We have devised three Specific Aims which outline the steps necessary to accomplish these goals. Successful
completion of these Aims will require indispensable contributions from every component of the MOVE
Consortium. In Aim 1, we will deeply characterize the immune response to priming immunogens designed to
activate bnAb precursors of one or more specificities (Project 1). While many aspects of this Aim are designed
to evaluate the extent to which immunogens are working as designed, equally important is identifying specific
genetic and structural features which need improvement during subsequent rounds of refinement and re-
evaluation (Structural Proteomics Core). In Aim 2, we will evaluate the human immunogenicity of candidate
priming immunogens by isolating immunogen-specific mAbs from HIV-naive humans. This is a critically
important aspect of our vaccine development process, as these mAbs are most accurate representation, short
of a human clinical trial, of the humoral immune response that will be triggered in actual human vaccine
recipients. These mAbs will also be used to create humanized animal models for more thorough vaccine
evaluation (Animal Models Core). In Aim 3, we will use our single cell immune multi-omics platform to rapidly
evaluate the immune response to sequential vaccine immunogens in near real-time, using the resulting B cell
profiles of specificity and function to inform selection of optimal candidates for subsequent boosts. Seamless
data sharing between MOVE components and sophisticated tools for visualization and analysis (Data
Management & Bioinformatics Core) will allow these analyses to occur within the normal time interval
between sequential immunizations. We can then dynamically adjust the parameters of each immunization
experiment to maximize our likelihood of success by focusing our experimental resources on the most
promising immunogen designs."
10895439,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 With recent advances in neonatal care, there is improved survival of extremely premature babies with
very low birth weight, although the complications of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remain. One of the most
severe of these complications is pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH). The true incidence of BPD-PH in preterm
babies is unknown, but prevalence is estimated to range from 17-40%. BPD and BPD-PH are typically diagnosed
at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD-PH leads to more days in the neonatal ICU, increased days of
ventilator and oxygen requirement, and the need for tracheostomy and home ventilator support. Furthermore,
these infants continue to have high mortality and morbidity with increased hospital readmissions in their first 2
years of life. Some clinical parameters and qualitative markers help predict development of BPD-PH at 36 weeks
PMA, such as infants born small for gestational age, maternal history of preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, and
early periods of ventilator support at 7 and 28 days of life. However, we lack quantitative markers to predict
development or long-term outcomes such as death, re-hospitalization, or response to therapies. A non-invasive
quantitative predictor would help stratify these infants early on and be appropriate for these frequently intubated
and medically fragile infants. In our preliminary study among infants with BPD-PH, we non-invasively obtained
tracheal aspirate and identified a specific panel of microRNAs (small noncoding RNAs) associated with hypoxic
stress response and angiogenic pathways. We have further conducted preliminary studies correlating tracheal
aspirate samples with that of saliva from extreme preterm infants.
 In this proposed K23 project, the Candidate (with advice from an outstanding multidisciplinary team of
mentors) will study salivary samples of extreme preterm infants for early identification of target miRNAs that
could predict development of BPD-PH and its long-term outcomes. This will be a prospective study of infants
born <28 weeks of gestation; saliva samples will be collected at 7 and 28 days of age and analyzed for markers
that could predict BPD-PH at 36 weeks of gestation. The Candidate will evaluate miRNA expression in infants
with BPD-PH over the first year of life and identify markers that predict diagnosis and outcomes, based on their
echocardiogram findings and oxygen requirements. By the end of this K23, the Candidate will have learned how
to design and carry out future miRNA studies and analyze their results. She also will have completed selected
relevant courses as part of her Master’s Degree in Clinical Research and received guidance on career
development. Data will be disseminated at meetings and published in peer-reviewed journals. In summary, this
project will provide a strong platform for future R01-type applications and help continue the Candidate’s positive
career trajectory and ultimate goal to become an independent physician-scientist and nationally recognized
expert in BPD-PH in premature infants."
10892292,"Dental caries represents a multifactorial disease that results from interactions among dental biofilms, the oral
environment, and tooth structure. Mounting reports in the literature demonstrated that fluoride could decrease
enamel demineralization and enhance enamel remineralization, and at sufficient concentrations, could inhibit
acid production by cariogenic bacteria. Fluoride is the cornerstone for dental caries prevention and remains its
first line of defense. Yet despite the extensive use of fluoride in dentistry for decades, dental caries remains a
serious public health problem worldwide. Limitations of current fluoride delivery technologies include low
penetration of delivered fluoride into sub-surface areas and short-term retention of delivered fluoride on teeth,
which prevent the full utilization of fluoride. However, few advancements in F technologies have been made in
past decades to overcome these limitations.
 We were inspired by reports that fluorine nonthermal plasmas (FNTPs) generated from F-containing feed
gases could produce free F atoms (F- ions and F free radicals) and that FNTPs have been used to synthesize
various metal fluorides. Our pioneering work in this area has demonstrated that FNTPs can deliver fluoride into
tooth enamel and enhance its remineralization using an in vitro pH cycling experiment. Moreover, our previous
in vitro work demonstrated that both argon (Ar) and Ar/O2 nonthermal plasmas (NTPs) efficiently decrease S.
mutans cells and S. mutans biofilm formation. Our in vivo study in female Sprague–Dawley rats showed that rat
molars treated with 2-minute Ar/O2 plasmas exhibited less decayed tooth surfaces 6 months after the plasma
treatment, 62.5% less on the upper molars and 31.6% less on the lower molars relative to untreated molars.
 In this application, we propose to generate biocompatible FNTPs and investigate their efficiencies on tooth
enamel remineralization, fluoride delivery into enamel, and inhibition of dental biofilm recovery with the ultimate
goal of developing FNTPs for control of dental caries. Our central hypothesis is that biocompatible FNTPs
generated from a plasma feed gas comprised of argon (Ar) gas and a nontoxic and nonirritating F-containing
gaseous compound will have the dual effects of enhancing remineralization via effective fluoridation and
inhibiting biofilm recovery. Two specific aims are designed to test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1, to generate
biocompatible FNTPs with desirable fluoride delivery capabilities, and Specific Aim 2, to assess the
effect and efficiency of FNTP treatment on enhanced remineralization of enamel, fluoride delivery into
enamel, and inhibition of dental biofilm recovery in vitro. This proposed research project will not only
contribute to our fundamental knowledge of FNTP generation and their interaction with tooth enamel and dental
biofilms, but also facilitate the development of FNTPs as an innovative approach for prevention and early
treatment of dental caries, thus producing a major impact in controlling this prominent hazard to human health."

Atrial fibrillation is a highly prevalent condition resulting in disordered contraction of the atria (top chambers of
the heart). It affects one in four individuals during their lifetime. It is known that the arrhythmia has a
bidirectional relationship with dysfunctional atrial contraction, a condition which itself is becoming understood
as a means by which individuals may develop heart failure. However, the majority of published literature to
date involves examining atrial function while lying supine at rest, thus incompletely characterizing the varying
states of exertion that one experiences during activities of daily living. Exercise-based cardiovascular magnetic
resonance imaging is a powerful non-invasive diagnostic modality that can measure heart function during
exercise and has the potential to uncover key mechanisms by which patients with atrial fibrillation may
progress to overt heart failure – and whether current treatment techniques (namely, catheter ablation) may
alter that trajectory.
The broad goal of this application is to facilitate training of the principal investigator, Dr. Cory Trankle, MD, for a
career as a patient-centered independent researcher who uses exercise-based diagnostic modalities (including
magnetic resonance imaging), with a specific interest in characterizing mechanisms of exercise limitations
such as left atrial dysfunction and identifying them as potential biomarkers and targets for therapeutic
interventions. In addition to didactic coursework and subspecialty seminars, Dr. Trankle will lead a
multidisciplinary team conducting a prospective clinical study investigating the effects that catheter ablation for
atrial fibrillation has on atrial function during exercise. He will address three specific aims in patients with atrial
fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation: (1) determine the effects of ablation on the ability of the left atrium to
augment its function during exercise, (2) determine the impacts ablation on left ventricular performance during
exercise, and (3) determine whether those changes experienced in left ventricular performance are indeed
associated with changes in left atrial function. A better understanding of the impact of catheter ablation, a
common treatment for atrial fibrillation, has on these cardiac structures during exercise has the potential to
identify those at highest risk for heart failure incidence and lead to more targeted treatment in this highly
prevalent disease."

Edema is a common, life-threatening consequence of congestive heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease
(CKD), and chronic liver disease. Loop diuretics are often used as a first-line therapy to quickly reduce the fluid
volume burden in HF, CKD, and liver failure patients. This class of diuretic works by inhibiting NaCl reabsorption
in the thick ascending limb (TAL) of Henle’s loop and increasing the delivery of NaCl to the distal convoluted
tubule (DCT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) comprising the distal nephron. In response to the increased NaCl
load, the DCT and CCD increase their NaCl reabsorption capacity through distal tubule remodeling involving
cell/tissue hypertrophy and by upregulating the expression of ion transporters and channels involved in NaCl
reabsorption. This compensatory mechanism diminishes the effectiveness of loop diuretics and gives rise to loop
diuretic resistance, which is a common clinical problem in the treatment of HF, CKD, and liver failure. A growing
consensus is that distally acting diuretics that inhibit sodium (Na+) reabsorption in the DCT (i.e., thiazide diuretics)
or CCD (i.e., amiloride) downstream of the TAL should be administered to overcome loop diuretic resistance.
However, both diuretic classes have serious liabilities that highlight the need for more effective, safer, and novel-
mechanism distal nephron-targeted diuretics. Heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels
have emerged over the last decade as potential distal nephron diuretic targets for two main reasons. First, these
basolateral membrane channels are expressed in the DCT and CCD and are essential for Na+ reabsorption in
both nephron segments. Secondly, and importantly, the loss of Kir4.1/5.1 function in patients with
SeSAME/EAST syndrome leads to renal salt wasting and low blood pressure, providing strong genetic
validation for Kir4.1/5.1 as a diuretic target in humans. We recently performed an NIH-funded
(R01DK120821; Denton PI) high-throughput screen (HTS) of 80,475 compounds from the Vanderbilt Institute of
Chemical Biology Discovery Collection and identified hundreds of structurally diverse small-molecule inhibitors
of Kir4.1/5.1. We employed iterative medicinal chemistry and functional analysis to drive the development of the
first-in-class, moderately potent (IC50 = 0.24 µM), highly selective (>30 fold over 9 related Kir channels), in vitro
inhibitor of Kir4.1/5.1, named VU6036720 (PMID 35246480). Unfortunately, however, VU6036720 failed to
induce a diuretic response in mice due to high plasma protein binding and rapid metabolic clearance. In Aim 1
of this follow-up application, we propose to employ medicinal chemistry and established functional assays to
further optimize the potency, selectivity, and drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties of
VU6036720 and other backup scaffolds identified in our HTS campaign. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the in vivo
activity of optimized inhibitors in mouse models of diuretic resistance and CKD. Completion of this program will
provide pre-clinical validation of Kir4.1/5.1 as a viable diuretic target, generally, and for circumventing
complications associated with diuretic resistance, specifically."
11111471,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ewing sarcoma is a highly aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor mainly affecting children and young adults,
which still lacks effective therapy. Due to its low mutational burden, there are very few acquired vulnerabilities in
Ewing sarcoma cells. During my postdoctoral work, I discovered that transcription factor ETV6 is among the
very few top Ewing sarcoma-biased dependencies. Remarkably, although ubiquitously expressed, ETV6 is not
essential for cancer cells outside Ewing sarcoma, based on CRISPR screening efforts from us and others.
Genetic studies in mice also revealed that ETV6 is dispensable in the majority of tissues. Hence, perturbing
ETV6 function in Ewing sarcoma will have a wide therapeutic index. In the proposed project, I aim to further
study the detailed mechanisms of how ETV6 maintains the cancer cell state, and leverage this new knowledge
to develop therapies for Ewing sarcoma patients with exceptional potency and specificity. To do so, I will
characterize the mesenchymal differentiation phenotype of ETV6-deficient Ewing sarcoma cells using high-
throughput functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics. Integration of these `-omic' approaches allow me
to obtain a deep biochemical understanding of the cancer maintenance function of ETV6 (Aim 1). Moreover, I
showed that expression of the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) domain of ETV6, which is responsible for its self-
oligomerization, has a dominant-negative effect to endogenous ETV6, and inhibits sarcomagenesis in vivo.
Therefore, I propose to optimize this SAM peptide to increase its potency and further engineer it for exogenous
delivery (Aim 2). Successful generation of a potent, and tumor penetrating ETV6 blocker will benefit therapy
development. Finally, as transcription factors, like ETV6, have proven to be challenging targets for drug
development, I profiled for endogenous metabolites that can bind ETV6 to unveil druggable pockets, and
identified its association with phosphatidic acid. I will further explore the regulatory effects of phosphatidic acid
binding to ETV6 in Ewing sarcoma (Aim 3). Results from these studies will guide small molecule development,
and more importantly, will also reflect a novel mechanism for metabolic control of gene expression through direct
allosteric regulation of transcription factors.
During the mentored K99 phase, I will work closely with my mentor Dr. Christopher Vakoc and co-mentor Dr.
Carolyn Fein Levy, and collaborators Drs. Stegmaier, Kentsis, Shi and Furukawa, recognized experts in pediatric
oncology, peptide therapy, screening methodology and structural biology respectively. I have also established
an exceptional advisory committee at CSHL, constituted by Drs. Joshua-Tor and Beyaz, who will monitor and
support my transition to independence. In addition, CSHL will provide me an outstanding scientific environment
for my research and training, being a conference hub for world-renowned meetings and courses. My objective
is to obtain a faculty position to develop an impactful research program, where the K99/R00 funding mechanism
will serve as an essential step in my transition to independence."
10890851,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychotic disorders are serious illnesses that lead to significant functional impairment, even during the early
course of illness (i.e., first-episode psychosis; FEP). Social cognition is a strong predictor of key functional
outcomes in psychosis (i.e., social and occupational functioning) and among social cognitive domains,
mentalizing – the ability to infer and reason about the mental states of other people – is most robustly impaired
and simultaneously most predictive of outcomes. However, existing interventions addressing social cognitive
dysfunction in psychosis are minimally effective in improving real-world outcomes. Further, though psychosis
studies have revealed abnormal function in brain areas comprising the mentalizing network (MN; e.g., medial
prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction), the vast majority of existing studies have utilized fMRI paradigms
that use non-human or non-interactive stimuli that may limit ecological validity and further fail to examine
associations between neural function and real-world outcomes. Collectively, social cognition is a critical factor in
psychosis that remains poorly understood. Thus, the proposed study will combine neural, behavioral, and real-
world functioning measures to delineate brain-behavior mechanisms of social cognition in FEP. The study will
enroll 45 FEP individuals and 45 matched non-clinical controls (NCC) and assess their neural (i.e., fMRI) and
behavioral (i.e., validated laboratory-based measures) social cognitive function as well as their real-world social
and occupational behavior. Data from this study will allow for an innovative investigation of whether MN
dysfunction is associated with social cognitive performance on validated behavioral tasks both across and within
FEP and NCC participants (Aim 1), and how these brain-behavior measures of social cognitive performance
relate to laboratory-based measures of social and occupational functioning (Aim 2). The current study will also
examine the extent to which MN function predicts real-world social and occupational functioning assessed via
ecological momentary assessment (Aim 3). This proposal concurrently provides an excellent opportunity to
receive mentor-directed, hands-on training in several key areas necessary to refine the candidate’s knowledge
and skill-sets. Though the candidate has extensive clinical research experience in FEP and has completed
foundational fMRI training, she proposes a training plan focused on three new domains: 1) advanced social-
cognitive neuroscience and fMRI task development, 2), linking of fMRI to behavioral constructs of social cognition
and functional outcome, and 3) translation of fMRI and behavioral constructs to psychosis. The proposed study
coupled with completion of the training plan will effectively launch the candidate toward her long-term goal of an
independent career in the translational neuroscience of social-cognitive dysfunction in early psychosis, and will
lay the foundation for future, high-impact R01 studies focused on refined identification and targeting of
biobehavioral factors influencing social and functional outcomes."

Until recently, the contribution of chromosomal sex to sex-associated differences in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been largely ignored. As females possess two X chromosomes, many genes that partially escape X inactivation could be expressed at higher levels in females. Escape from X chromosome inactivation occurs with aging and the degree of inactivation escape varies between genes and cell types. The HECT, UBA and WWE domain containing protein 1 (HUWE1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates over 40 substrates. HUWE1 ubiquitinates and induces the degradation of DNA damage response proteins, transcription factors, and other proteins. The Huwe1 gene is located on the X chromosome and associated with X chromosome-linked intellectual disability. Increased dosages of HUWE1 due to duplication events result in intellectual disability in children with females being normal or less symptomatic than males, likely due to X chromosome inactivation. Mutations in Huwe1 lead to intellectual disability as well, and females can also be severely affected as males. Whether HUWE1 plays a role in aging and AD is not studied. In our data, we discovered that HUWE1 levels are higher in aged female mouse brains compared to young brains. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate whether Huwe1 escapes inactivation in the brain of female Tg2576 and Tau p301 s mice (and their non-Tg controls), and female humans with and without AD and to determine HUWE1's interactome in the brain of young and aged, male and female Tg2576 and Tau p301s mice (their non-Tg controls). Since clinical research has demonstrated variable efficacy of therapeutic agents in male and female patients, identification of sex-specific mechanisms has significant translational relevance."

More than 8 million women in the US identify as a sexual minority- including lesbian, gay,
bisexual, or queer, yet the health needs of this population remain understudied. Studies show
sexual minority women are less likely to receive routine preventive care, including cancer
screening. Studies of breast and cervical cancer risk among sexual minority women are mixed,
with higher prevalence of risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, and obesity, but lower
prevalence of risk factors such as HPV infection and use of hormonal contraceptives. As no
national cancer registries collect information on sexual identity, we have no population-level
estimates of cancer burden among sexual minority women and are unable to accurately
evaluate disparities or prioritize interventions to improve low screening rates. We propose to first
characterize existing sexual identity disparities in cervical cancer screening uptake using a
structural equation modeling approach (Aim 1). This approach will evaluate the extent to which
previously described disparities in screening uptake are mediated by differences in care access,
prevalence of cancer risk factors, or both. We will then incorporate these data into a simulation
model of cancer progression to produce feasible estimates of cervical cancer incidence and
mortality by stage among sexual minority women (Aim 2). Finally, we will repeat the application
of this full framework to assess relevant mediators of breast cancer screening and update the
existing model to reflect our understanding of breast cancer natural history to estimate incidence
and mortality among sexual minority women (Aim 3). My career to date has focused on using
econometric and simulation modeling to better understand and address gaps in cervical cancer
prevention among traditionally underserved populations. My ultimate goal is an independent
research career focusing on effective strategies to reduce cancer health inequities among
sexual and gender minority individuals. This award will allow her to take the next step in her
career, building on her background in health equity and decision modeling while facilitating her
training in causal epidemiology approaches, breast cancer epidemiology, and the health needs
of sexual minority women. Dr. Spencer's training plan draws on the extensive methodological
expertise of her mentorship team and the exceptional educational and professional resources at
Dell Medical School. The overall goal of this work is to improve the health of sexual minority
women through characterizing multilevel sources of inequities in breast and cervical cancer
screening, incidence, and mortality."
10739477,"Potable water is a major source of opportunistic pathogens that cause a variety of life-threatening infections in
immunocompromised people, with a yearly US economic burden of $2.4 billion dollars. Biofilms ubiquitously coat
surfaces within building premise plumbing that delivers potable water (e.g. water pipes, faucets, shower heads)
and serve as a reservoir for opportunistic pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. My postdoctoral
studies and work from other laboratories implicate potable water as a source of P. aeruginosa that causes deadly
respiratory infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). While P. aeruginosa persists in premise plumbing
biofilms for months or years prior to infection, it is unknown how evolution in this niche impacts its pathogenic
potential. The success of P. aeruginosa as a CF pathogen is owed in part to how it adaptively evolves in response
to selective pressures in the airways, including nutrient limitation, antimicrobials, phagocytosis by immune cells,
and microbiota interactions. Selective pressures in plumbing resemble those in the airways, including scarce
nutrients, residual disinfectant (e.g. monochloramine), phagocytosis by amoebae, and polymicrobial competition.
Preliminary data suggests evolution in plumbing impacts traits associated with infection of CF airways. The long-
term goal of the candidate, Dr. Catherine Armbruster, is to establish an independent research program focused
on how evolution of opportunistic pathogens in response to selective pressures faced in plumbing biofilms
impacts downstream pathogenesis at different sites of infection. To achieve this goal, the immediate career
objective of Dr. Armbruster is to obtain an independent faculty position using research proposed in this
application as the foundation of her job applications. The overall research objective is to understand how
evolution in response to selective pressures in plumbing biofilms impacts colonization and persistence in CF
airways. The hypothesis is that low nutrients, polymicrobial competition, and exposure to monochloramine in
plumbing biofilms select for P. aeruginosa traits that promote biofilm formation, protection from antimicrobials
and immune responses, and increase competitiveness against microbes in CF airways. To test this hypothesis,
two specific aims are proposed. The first aim identifies key P. aeruginosa pathways for survival in plumbing and
how they evolve in response to specific pressures applied in a potable water biofilm model system. The second
aim defines the subset of these adaptations that enhance fitness during host-pathogen interactions, using CF as
a model system. These aims are expected to demonstrate how opportunistic pathogens are shaped by specific
ecological and evolutionary factors prior to infection that impact downstream host-pathogen interactions.
Successful completion of these aims will provide preliminary data for a competitive R01 application within two
years of this award. Finally, proposed career development activities will complement Dr. Armbruster’s prior
training. Dr. Bomberger, the postdoctoral advisor to Dr. Armbruster, is included as a scientific advisor because
she is a leader in CF research with a strong track record of training successful independent academic scientists."

Individuals with chronic MSK pain conditions who experience disability-related limitations in physical activity
participation are at higher risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes. Chronic patellar tendinopathy is a
highly prevalent chronic MSK condition that severely limits performance, physical activity, self-perceived
function, and quality of life. Whole person health (WPH) is a comprehensive framework that considers
interconnected domains (biological, behavioral, social, environmental) that foster health, and is designed to
facilitate multicomponent therapeutic interventions. The applicant’s long-term career objective is to establish
a funded research program that develops and evaluates a WPH model to decrease disability and improve
quality of life for individuals with for chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions. Current standard of clinical care
for patients with chronic patellar tendinopathy take a unifocal approach, emphasizing local tendon pain and
capacity, does not incorporate other factors (psychological, social, environmental) that may contribute to the
patient’s overall health. The overall objective of this study for this career development award is to develop a
WHP framework that is responsive to the critical gaps in the literature and will inform future intervention
approaches for patellar tendinopathy. The approach will expand the standard of care progressive loading
exercise treatment (PLE) utilizing individualized biofeedback augmented movement retraining and behavioral
graded exposure techniques to develop and refine a novel patellar tendon WPH intervention (WPH), and
evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and responsiveness of key biopsychosocial outcomes (landing mechanics,
psychological distress, tendon stiffness). The central hypothesis of this study is that individuals with chronic
patellar tendinopathy who utilize novel WPH for patellar tendinopathy rehabilitation will demonstrate
improvements in self-reported function, landing biomechanics, and tissue capacity. The hypothesis will be
tested through three specific aims: 1) refine WPH intervention protocols through a small case series study
using mixed-methods approach, 2) establish feasibility and acceptability benchmarks, and 3) determine safety
and responsiveness of WPH compared to PLE on primary outcome of (a) patient self-reported function and
psychological distress, and secondary outcomes of (b) landing biomechanics and (c) patellar tendon stiffness
through a pilot randomized controlled study. The proposed work is innovative, in that: 1) it will be the first
study to utilize a WPH framework compared to standard of care and evaluate a novel combination of outcomes
for the treatment of chronic tendinopathy. The study is significant as it addresses an important gap in
knowledge, moving beyond outdated traditional care models to create novel clinical care model designed to
mitigate the debilitating effects of tendon pain on quality of life. Doing so takes a substantial step forward to
enhance patient-oriented long-term outcomes for individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions."

Upper Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Diseases (EGIDs) include Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) and Eosinophilic
Gastroenteritis (EGE, which encompasses Eosinophilic Gastritis, EoG, and Eosinophilic Duodenitis, EoD).
EGE is one of the more rare EGID subtypes which results in significant morbidity in all genders and ages.
Patients with EGE suffer from significant GI symptoms, often mislabeled as irritable bowel syndrome,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Due to issues in ascertainment of adequate biopsy tissues and eosinophil
enumeration in biopsies, these diseases often go under-recognized, resulting in significant healthcare and
patient cost. While the etiology of EGE is unknown, we and others have observed that 60-80% of EGE cases
coexist with EoE and the remaining 20-40% are isolated EGE cases. Similar to EoE, EGE likely has different
immune underpinnings potentially reflected by whether the disease manifests as a more diffuse eosinophilic
disease (EGE+EoE) or whether it is isolated eosinophilic disease (EGE). We propose to investigate
immunologic signatures in EGE cases with and without concurrent EoE and determine if these signatures
predict elevated gastrointestinal eosinophil counts in high-risk relatives without a diagnosis of EGE. Certain
tissue-based RNA signatures (especially those related to eosinophil inflammation) may accurately identify and
predict EGE, and thus provide a solution to the under-recognition from poor biopsy protocols and lack of
eosinophil enumeration. We have recently published that EoE increases one’s risk for EGE in self and families.
Identification of relatives of EoE probands with Th2 (or other) mediated inflammation may reflect increased
eosinophilia, identifying missed disease or those who would benefit from further work up with eosinophil
enumeration. This proposal seeks to further understanding of the immunopathology of EGE through study of
those with and without involvement of EoE and associated conditions. This project will aid in the identification
of biomarkers for earlier diagnosis and management of EGE leading to fewer endoscopies and biopsies along
with more personalized disease management."
10867450,"Project Summary
A major problem for persons suffering from addiction is persistent vulnerability to relapse, even after long periods
of abstinence. In the `incubation of cocaine craving' model of relapse, rats self-administer cocaine using a Long
Access procedure, and then experience a prolonged abstinence period. During abstinence, rats exhibit a
progressive intensification (incubation) of cue-induced cocaine craving. Plasticity involving medium spiny
neurons in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) is required for the expression of `incubated' cue-induced craving.
However, to date no incubation studies have focused on another cell type in the NAcc, the Cholinergic
Interneuron (CIN). CINs make up only 1-2% of NAcc neurons, but are critically involved in learning, memory,
and motivated behaviors. CINs are tonically active, and considerable work now supports the idea that a reduction
in their activity augments motivated behavior. Other work has shown that dopamine D2 receptors (D2-R) on CINs
reduce CIN activity and this correlates with greater motivated behavior; furthermore, D2-R are upregulated in
NAc following cocaine self-administration (SA). Finally, striatal CINs are unique in exhibiting steady-state
activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway, linked to their tonic firing. The ISR maintains cellular
homeostasis by regulating protein translation. In other cell types, the level of ISR activity regulates motivation for
cocaine. This has not been tested for CINs, but the ISR does affect D2-R signaling in these neurons. Integrating
these findings, the over-arching hypothesis to be tested here is that cocaine SA and a subsequent abstinence
period leads to increased D2-R expression on NAcc CINs. This leads to a potentiated inhibition of CINs in
response to DA released during cue presentation, increasing cocaine seeking and leading to reduced ISR activity
and translational reprogramming in CINs. Together these changes contribute to increased motivation for
cocaine-paired cues. To test this hypothesis, transgenic rats and Cre-driven viruses will be used to selectively
monitor and manipulate NAcc CINs. Aim 1 will use fiber photometry to determine the effect of cocaine SA and
an abstinence period on the Ca2+ response (a proxy for activity) to a cocaine-paired cue in CINs, and how D2-R
regulate this response. Recordings will be performed during cue-induced seeking tests on withdrawal day (WD)
1, prior to incubation, and WD40 (after incubation). Aim 2 will determine the role that CINs play in the expression
of `incubated' seeking, through bidirectionally manipulating CINs via chemogenetics prior to WD1 or WD40
seeking tests. Aim 3 will explore how incubation of cocaine craving changes protein translation in CINs, using
cell type specific translating ribosome affinity purification to identify active translating mRNAs (including mRNAs
for the D2-R and markers of ISR activity) and a new viral tool (SPOTlight) to measure ISR activity. While this
work is underway, I will participate in a multi-faceted training plan to develop the non-bench skills needed to
reach my goal of becoming an independent PI in an academic setting. I will be supported by my Mentor, co-
Mentor, and other Advisory Committee members, who have complementary expertise related to my goals."
10890857,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
At 45 million people, immigrants compose approximately 14% of the United States population. Among
immigrants, 10.5 million are undocumented immigrants and 80% of them are Latino. California, the site of the
proposed study, has 11 million immigrants, which is a quarter of all immigrants in the country. California also
has the largest undocumented immigrant population, with 2.3 million or 22% of the immigrants in the state.
Similar to the US overall, most immigrants in California are Latino, and 71% of undocumented immigrants are
Mexican-born. There is consistent evidence that Latinos have the worst patterns of access to and use of health
care compared to any other racial or ethnic group, and these inequities are even worse for Latino immigrants,
especially for undocumented immigrants. Even when safety net programs are designed to increase access to
care for immigrants, they do not always optimally engage them. In California, recent state policies have
allowed income-eligible undocumented immigrants under the age of 26 and over the age of 49 years to enroll
in its Medicaid program. Recent studies, however, have shown that even when eligible, many do not enroll
because they fear deportation or distrust the government. This fear and distrust were exacerbated in 2019
when the Trump administration changed the definition of the “public charge” rule, which allows for the denial of
a visa or permanent residency if immigrants are dependent or likely to become dependent on public benefits
including Medicaid. Approximately 193,000 eligible undocumented Latino immigrants in California did not enroll
in Medicaid because of this change, even after the Biden administration reversed the definition in 2021. This
study will provide a unique opportunity to understand the etiology of mis- and disinformation among Latino
immigrants and the related “chilling effects,” which are a deterrent to exercising one’s rights to public benefits,
including enrolling in Medicaid and seeking health care, because of government laws or action. Current
understanding of the causes of chilling effects for Latino immigrants is mostly anecdotal and limited to framing
as “fear” and/or “distrust” without the knowledge of the mechanisms that connect mis- and disinformation and
chilling effects. We have designed a multi-methods, multi-level study to determine how communication is
accessed, assessed, interpreted, spread, and acted upon and how these vary by documentation and
citizenship status for Latinos. The study will use key informant interviews of organizational and community
leaders, a follow-up study of 1,100 Latino adults in the 2025 and 2026 California Health Interview Survey
(CHIS), and machine learning analyses of social media data. Using an adapted version of the NIMHD research
framework and emerging research on the communication infrastructure as a social determinant of health, this
study will provide new evidence on mis- and disinformation and yield valuable insights that can be used to
inform policies and programs to reduce health care inequities for Latino immigrants."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by episodes
acute disease flares, resulting in significant morbidity and disease burden to patients, care
and health systems. While the etiology of AD remains unknown, it is thought to involve a
interplay between genetic, immune, and environmental mechanisms. Mutations in the
gene result in skin barrier dysfunction and are associated with more severe and
disease in AD. However, little is known about the genetics of AD in other populations
from those o European ancestry. Latinx are an admixed population and have higher rates
AD compared to non-Latinx whites. The study of admixed populations such as Latinx
an opportunity to examine the individual contributions of ancestry, genetics, and the
interactions with genetic variation to the pathogenesis of complex diseases such
AD. The main purpose of this study is to examine the presence of FLG loss of function (LoF)
and (2) to explore the relationship between ancestry, genetic variation, and disease
in Latinx with AD. Data obtained from this study, would then serve to inform the
of future research to help us improve our diagnostic and management strategies.

Overuse of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) continues to drive increasing antibiotic resistance.
Provider-driven clinical decision support (CDS) has had a minimal impact on decreasing antibiotic prescribing
rates. The overall objectives of this application are to 1) implement registered nurse (RN)-driven CDS
containing integrated clinical prediction rules (iCPRs) [decision aids embedded into the electronic health record
which determine risk of bacterial infection based on elements of the patient history and physical examination]
and 2) determine the impact of RN-driven CDS on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing and resource use. The
central hypothesis is that RNs using iCPR will accurately determine patients’ risk for bacterial ARI, recommend
appropriate testing and treatment based on that risk and will have lower rates of inappropriate antibiotic
prescribing compared to providers. The rationale for this project is that a CDS tool can allow RNs to work at the
full scope of their licenses and decrease inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. This central hypothesis will be
tested using three specific aims: 1) adapt and implement an RN driven iCPR tool for evaluation and treatment
of patients with ARIs in primary care and urgent care practices; 2) determine the impact of the RN driven iCPR
on antibiotic prescribing, diagnostic test-ordering, resource use patterns, and cost-effectiveness; and 3) use a
theory-driven implementation framework to identify barriers and facilitators to, and optimize factors influencing,
effective implementation of an RN-driven iCPR. For the first aim, the previously developed and studied provider
iCPR will be adapted for RN workflow and a RN training program will be implemented to train RNs in its use for
patient evaluation and treatment. For the second aim, a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial will be
conducted at primary care and urgent care clinics at the four participating institutions. For the third aim, the
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) and Proctor’s Framework will be used as guides to assess
implementation outcomes and use findings to drive post-implementation tool optimization and create an
implementation toolkit. The proposed project is innovative because it: 1) uses CDS tools with risk stratification
to enable RNs to lead initial ARI assessment and treatment; 2) uses an evidence-based implementation
framework to evaluate outcomes and identify barriers and facilitators; and 3) evaluates the cost of the
intervention which is critical in increasing dissemination potential. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to provide a scalable implementation model leveraging CDS and RN training tools to
decrease antibiotic overuse, lower the cost of care, and ultimately reduce antibiotic resistance."
10904947,"ABSTRACT. Black Americans face nearly double the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related
compared to Whites. Black American men may be at increased risk for late-life neurological disorders associated
with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) from contact sports participation
and other risk factors. Exposure to RHI/TBI is linked with late-life cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric
disturbances, and structural brain changes. Black racial identity and exposure to RHI/TBI has been shown to
have an additive effect on MRI metrics of atrophy and cerebrospinal fluid neurodegenerative disease proteins.
These neurological disparities might be explained by social determinants of health (SDOH) (e.g., education
access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood environment), which might affect resistance
and resilience to other neurological disorders from RHI/TBI. SDOH factors might indeed contribute to
neurological outcomes in adult Black men irrespective of RHI/TBI. Yet, there has been persistent under-
representation of Blacks in biomedical and health research, including among studies of the late effects
of RHI from American football play. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the impact of RHI/TBI
from American football and the contribution of early-life SDOH to later-life cognitive function, neuropsychiatric
symptoms, structural MRI features, and plasma biomarkers in Black male former American football athletes and
non-RHI/TBI exposed Black men. We will recruit 100 Black male former American football athletes (across all
levels of play and cognitive continuum, 50+ years) and 100 age-matched Black males without RHI/TBI.
Participants will enroll to complete harmonized cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests, MRI, and blood draw to
assess neurodegenerative disease proteins. A battery of questionnaires (e.g., Adverse Childhood Experiences,
Childhood-Experiences Survey, SHARELIFE survey) will be administered to assess SDOH. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the association between RHI/TBI and later-life cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in Black
male former American football athletes. Aim 2 will investigate the association between RHI/TBI and later-life
biomarkers of Aß, p-tau, and neurodegeneration outcomes in Black male former American football athletes. Aim
3 will examine the contribution of SDOH to later-life cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and later-life
biomarkers of Aß, p-tau, and neurodegeneration outcomes. Our hypotheses are that (1) RHI/TBI will be
associated with worse cognitive and neuropsychiatric function and compromised structural gray/white matter in
Black former football players; (2) impoverished SDOH will increase risk and reduce resilience to the late-life
effects of RHI/TBI; and (3) impoverished SDOH will mediate the effects of RHI on late-life neurological outcomes.
This R01 will discover the role of RHI/TBI and SDOH in older Black men. We will address racial disparities
present in data on late life neurological outcomes from RHI/TBI to facilitate accurate disease detection and
diagnosis at the individual-level."

 Heart failure (HF) has a high morbidity and mortality. Its incidence is increasing worldwide. One hallmark of
HF is endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction which initially manifests as impaired endothelium-dependent
vasodilation of the epicardial coronary arteries and the microvasculature. Another important hallmark of HF is
the presence of interstitial fibrosis, which increases myocardial stiffness and cardiac work, elevates diastolic
pressures and increases pulmonary interstitial fluid to impair oxygenation. Genetic lineage tracing showed that
most HF fibroblasts originate from tissue-resident fibroblasts, which expand and differentiate into
myofibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating fibroblast activation and myofibroblast
transdifferentiation remain poorly understood. Intercellular communication, especially EC-fibroblast crosstalk,
plays a substantial modulatory role in the normal and failing heart. More specifically, factors secreted by
cardiac microvascular EC modulate cardiac performance and cardiac fibrosis. Thus, targeting endothelial
dysfunction has the potential to be a promising therapeutic avenue for HF.
 Recently, we and other groups discovered that genes important for the control of cell identity exhibit a
unique epigenetic signature, e.g., broad enrichment of the activating histone modification H3K4me3 and super-
enhancer marks. These discoveries prompted our pilot work to develop the first computational model for the
discovery of new EC master regulators. This novel model employs an analysis of both the epigenetic
landscape as well as the gene expression network. It successfully recaptured known EC identity genes with
high sensitivity and accuracy. The model further revealed a number of top ranked genes with no reported role
in EC, making them promising candidates as novel EC identity genes. One of the most top-ranked genes is
transcription factor 4 (TCF4), which displays typical features of cell identity gene in EC.
 Interestingly, we have preliminary data showing that TCF4 function is a master regulator that maintains EC
identity. Further, TCF4 is downregulated in cardiac ECs of HF patients compared to non-failing controls. The
silencing of TCF4 in EC leads to an increase of EC-secreted proteins TGFβ1, which stimulate fibroblast
activation and myofibroblasts transdifferentiation, and thus promote cardiac fibrosis. In this proposal, we will
investigate the role of TCF4 in EC identity maintenance. We will further investigate the role of TCF4 in the
crosstalk between ECs and fibroblasts, and reveal TCF4 as a therapy target to prevent cardiac fibrosis in HF.
Successful completion of this proposal will be the first to define TCF4 as a novel EC master regulator that
maintains EC phenotype and function. We will uncover an overlooked determinant of HF -- loss of EC identity.
TCF4 dysregulation disturbs EC-fibroblast crosstalk within the heart, aggravating cardiac fibrosis in HF.
Therapeutic modulation of EC-specific TCF4 delivery may be a novel and promising approach for treating HF."

Spatial cellular heterogeneity contributes to the complexity of diseases, therapeutic treatment, and drug
response, which commonly involve the interplay between different molecular levels including genetic, epigenetic,
and cellular levels. Recent technological advances of spatial technologies have enabled the elucidation of single
cell heterogeneity with rich information and spatial locations that offer remarkable opportunities to understand
biological processes and molecular interplays involved in disease and therapeutics. Moreover, traditional
approaches mostly focus on a single type of data that cannot fully address this complexity and heterogeneity.
Therefore, there is a lack of integrative approaches that leverage the strengths of data from multiple sources
(e.g., genomics, epigenomics, clinical data) to achieve full insights into the pathobiology of complex disease and
drug response. Given these challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, the overall goals of my
research program are to develop a novel class of machine learning, statistical and deep learning approaches for
the enhancement, prioritization and interpretation of spatially organized cells in complex tissue, to better
understand the molecular mechanisms underpinning diseases and drug response, which will empower precision
medicine by identifying individualized biomarkers for disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Specifically,
in the next five years, my team will (i) develop a novel transfer learning approach to impute the transcriptomics
and epigenomics profiles in spatial slices; (ii) develop a computational framework to reveal disease-associated
phenotypes in spatially distributed cells, through leveraging Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) studies;
(iii) develop a novel domain adaptation method to predict drug responses of spatial cells, using
pharmacogenomics knowledge base; (iv) develop a novel class of statistical methods for the joint analysis of
spatial transcriptomics and single-cell multi-omics data, thus unveil the underlying regulatory mechanisms in
diseases and drug response. In the meantime, supported by Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center, we
will apply the methodologies to different studies such as Brain Metastasis and Alzheimer’s Disease for novel
scientific findings. We will work closely with collaborating biostatisticians and biologists to interpret the biological
discoveries. Importantly, we will work with experimental labs to validate the findings. In line with our previous
work, we will continue to make all developed methods into open-source software tools that are accessible and
useful to the biomedical research community."

Many phenotypes, as well as the risk of developing many diseases, are genetically complex, and
involve contributions from both genetic and non-genetic factors. Work in human genetics over the
past two decades have shown that this variation is the result of contributions from a very large
number of sites, on the order of thousands or tens of thousands. This presents challenges for
both the measurement and interpretation of genetic association studies, as real genetic effects
can be difficult to distinguish from the effects of confounding biases. On the other hand, biobank
scale resources represent a tremendous opportunity to learn about both the biology of complex
traits, and the evolutionary forces that have shaped modern patterns of variation. My group will
develop statistical methods to overcome several current challenges in the study of genetically
complex traits by apply tools from population, quantitative and statistical genetics.
First, we will develop tools to diagnose and correct for ancestry stratification biases in polygenic
scores. Even subtle stratification biases compound across loci to cause problems with polygenic
predictions, so methods of carefully accounting for these biases are needed. Second, we will
study the role of mutational pressure in maintaining complex disease and shaping its genetic
architecture. The increasingly availability of exome and genome-wide sequencing association
datasets make estimating the strength of mutational pressure toward increased disease risk
increasingly feasible. New theoretical development will be needed to make and interpret these
measurements. Third, we will develop models to study how mutation and selection jointly shape
the distribution of heritability for complex traits across genomic regions with different functions.
Current methods confound these two effects, so there is an opportunity for principled population
genetic modeling to provide clarity on the biology of complex traits. Finally, we will develop
improved methods for coalescent inference in population genetics. Recent breakthroughs in
coalescent inference have begun to reshape our ability to learn about evolutionary events from
genome sequencing data. However, these methods exhibit clear accuracy-scalability tradeoffs,
suggesting that a thoughtful approach to inference is needed if the benefits of these methods are
to be fully realized. My group will develop methods for accurately estimating coalescent times
from sequencing data."

Eukaryotic cells use multi-layered strategies to ensure the fidelity of gene expression. One of the best-studied
RNA quality control pathways is Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a ribosome-associated surveillance
machinery that recognizes and degrades cellular transcripts with premature termination codons (PTC). Initially
identified as a mechanism to rid the cell of faulty mRNAs, it is now known that NMD also regulates the expression
of 5-10% of cellular transcripts with important functions in cell differentiation, homeostasis, cellular stress
responses, and more. In addition, recent studies have shown that many proteins of the NMD pathway function
in the cell-autonomous defense against RNA viruses, including human-pathogenic alphaviruses, coronaviruses
and flaviviruses. As obligate intracellular parasites, these viruses interface closely with cellular mRNA processing
pathways, and we can gain new insight to NMD functions by understanding how the machinery is repurposed to
fight viral infection. We currently have a very incomplete picture of NMD functions during viral infection. Many
viruses lack PTCs or other NMD-inducing features, and it is not known whether NMD proteins recognize viral
RNA in manners similar to canonical NMD, or through new and unusual interactions or mechanisms. Moreover,
NMD is often globally downregulated during virus infection, suggesting that viruses have mechanisms to rewire
the antiviral NMD network. Using the flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) as a model RNA virus, we aim to understand
the molecular interactions between the NMD machinery and viral infection. We will dissect the NMD-ZIKV
protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction network with a multi-disciplinary approach that combines virology
with RNA biochemistry and high-throughput assays to link molecular interactions to cellular phenotypes. Specific
questions addressed within this study are: 1) How do NMD proteins interact to fight viral infection? 2) Are there
specific features in the viral RNA that trigger NMD, and if so, how are they recognized by the NMD machinery?
3) How do viral proteins inhibit NMD? And 4) Are antiviral NMD functions conserved in the important mosquito
host of flaviviruses? Collectively, our study will provide new insight into an important cell-autonomous antiviral
defense network. In addition, by studying the unusual ways in which NMD is regulated during virus infection, we

Losing weight can be life saving for people with obesity. Although many people with obesity lose weight with
diet and exercise, the vast majority regain this lost weight over time. Multiple pharmacological treatments have
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help patients lose weight. However, in each
case the effect of these treatments is temporary, and weight is regained when the treatment is stopped. This
means that patients must take these medications for the rest of their lives to realize their health benefits. In
addition to the financial cost of life-long medication, patients must contend with side effects and medication
resistance. As such, there remains an unmet need for new medical interventions that produce weight loss
without lifelong treatment. In this proposal we aim to investigate how dopamine function is altered as animals
gain weight. Reductions in dopamine function have been linked to obesity, and drugs that decrease dopamine
function (such as antipsychotic medications) cause weight gain. This leads to our central hypothesis that
obesity reduces dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which causes overeating and
weight gain. A corollary of this hypothesis is that boosting dopamine release would lead to weight loss.
Indeed, either direct stimulation of dopamine neurons or administration of drugs that increase dopamine
release (such as amphetamine) cause weight loss. However, due to side effects and abuse liability,
dopaminergic stimulants are not useful therapeutics. For this reason, our primary Aim is to understand the
cellular changes in dopamine function that occur as animals become obese, to inform the design of
neuromodulation approaches to permanently reverse these changes to drive lasting weight loss without life-
long medication. To test this hypothesis, we propose to compare in vivo dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens of control vs. obese mice (Aim 1). We will also employ ex vivo electrophysiological approaches to
determine the cellular mechanisms underlying changes in dopamine neuron activity in obese mice (Aim 2).
And finally, we will engage neuroplasticity in dopamine neurons to chronically boost dopamine release, to test
whether this causes long-lasting reductions in food intake and body weight (Aim 3). This research will provide a
critical foundation to advance efforts for modulating food seeking and intake, to inform and improve weight loss
outcomes in people with obesity."
10912053,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Influenza viruses remain a major global threat to human health, which is exacerbated by the lack of an effective
vaccine. Humoral immunity does not target all parts of the virus evenly, a phenomenon known as
immunodominance. Following seasonal vaccination, humans preferentially generate antibody responses against
evolving epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain rather than against broadly protective epitopes of the
conserved stalk domain. In the absence of preexisting immunity against the HA head, as occurred with the 2009
pandemic H1N1 virus, humans can preferentially recall memory B cells against the stalk domain. However, naïve
B cells against novel epitopes of the HA head are induced, populate the memory B cell pool, and are
preferentially recalled following exposure to an antigenically similar virus. Therefore, immunodominance of the
head domain and the preferential recruitment of naïve B cells against new epitopes remains a major obstacle for
the generation of a broadly protective influenza vaccine. In order to generate broadly protective humoral
immunity, a vaccine needs to be designed that induces robust and durable antibody responses against the stalk
domain but prevents the recruitment of naïve B cells against neoepitopes.
Immunodominance is in part dictated by which B cells can acquire antigen and efficiently present antigen to CD4
T cells. B cell avidity, the simultaneous binding of both binding-sites of an antibody with its epitope and the cross-
linking of multiple B cell receptors on a B cells, plays a critical role in which B cell specificities are selected. B
cells against the head domain have an avidity advantage, as these epitopes are more accessible than those of
the stalk domain. We hypothesize that reducing B cell avidity for head epitopes will reduce competition for
antigen, limit the induction of anti-head B cells, and preferentially select for B cells against the stalk domain.
Using combinatorial mutagenesis and yeast-display, we will generate and select for a library of stable HAs with
diverse head epitopes but an identical stalk domain, which we refer to as scrambled HA (Aim 1). By titrating the
diversity of scrambled HAs, we will determine the effect of increasing head epitope diversity on which B and T
follicular helper cell specificities are induced. We will perform these experiments in naïve and H1N1 immune
mice to mimic immune histories in infants and adults, respectively (Aim 2). Moreover, we will immunize human
ex vivo lymph node organoids generated from individuals of diverse immune histories to determine if our
approach recalls memory B cells against the stalk domain (Aim 3). Together, this study will generate a vaccine
that shifts immunodominance towards the stalk domain, which will be proven using multiple models of preexisting
immunity. Although this proposal focuses on shifting immunodominance of anti-influenza humoral immunity, the
approach taken provides a proof-of-concept that can be applied to other rapidly evolving pathogens for which
immunodominance is a key barrier for successful vaccine generation, including HIV and coronaviruses."
10888385,"Every year, nearly 25-50% of older adults fall. However, fall prevention efforts are not uniformly
effective and factors contributing to fall risk are not completely understood. The vestibular system,
part of the inner ear, is a known contributor to fall risk and recent evidence suggests that cognition
may interact with vestibular function to influence falls. Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) fall
2-3 times more than cognitively healthy adults and those with vestibular dysfunction exhibit
changes in cognition. However, these relationships have not been fully elucidated. As the
vestibular system is diverse, identifying which functional pathways (i.e., reflexive, perceptual,
visual-vestibular integration) are related to both cognition and imbalance is vital for development
of targeted interventions to reduce falls. The specific aims examine the extent to which vestibular
function is associated with sensorimotor behaviors (balance and falls) in AD (Aim 1a) and the
extent to which cognition is associated with sensorimotor behaviors in adults with vestibular loss
(Aim 1b). Explicit comparisons between those with AD and vestibular loss will also be made (Aim
1c) in order to determine potential similarities and inform ongoing fall prevention interventions in
these patient populations. Existing measures will be combined with novel laboratory techniques
in order to directly inform clinical practice and elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying fall
risk. The K01 award period will enable the PI to build upon her existing clinical and research
expertise in vestibular science and provide structured training in the following areas: a) aging, b)
cognition and cognitive impairment, c) advanced techniques for assessment of balance and gait,
and d) advanced techniques for measuring eye movements. Research and training experiences
during this award period will help the PI become an independent researcher in vestibular
physiology. The proposed work will take place at Ohio State University under the mentorship of
Dr. Dan Merfeld and Dr. Yuri Agrawal in conjunction with subject area specific mentorship from
leaders in their respective fields. The proposed training activities and research plan are consistent
with the NIDCD’s strategic plan for research in balance, specifically addressing current
understanding of self-motion perception in health and disease and factors contributing to
imbalance and falls in older adults. The proposed training will be the foundation for future R01
applications using advanced vestibular assessment techniques to examine changes in sensory
function related to diverse pathologies and relationships to postural control."
10738261,"Project Summary
Complex organisms are able to rapidly induce select genes among thousands in response to diverse
environmental cues. This occurs in the context of large genomes condensed with histone proteins into
chromatin. The macrophage response to pathogen sensing, for example, rapidly engages highly conserved
signaling pathways and transcription factors (TFs) for coordination of inflammatory gene induction. Enriched
integration of histone H3.3, the ancestral histone H3 variant, is a feature of inflammatory genes and, in general,
dynamically regulated chromatin and transcription. The amino-terminal H3.3 `tail' differs from the other H3
proteins by a single amino acid, a serine at position 31. However, little is known of how (or which) features of
H3.3, conserved from yeast to human, might enable rapid and high-level transcription. We have recently
discovered a potent function for H3.3-specific histone phosphorylation (H3.3S31ph) in inflammatory gene
transcription and surprising evidence that non-canonical activity of the DNA-damage response (DDR) pathway
mediates this histone phosphorylation. Thus, we hypothesize that the DDR pathway is coopted for epigenetic
regulation of inflammatory genes. In Aim 1 we will identify the factors and sequence of events that link DDR
factors and H3.3S31ph to rapid inflammatory gene transcription and reveal the function of cross-talk between
DDR and chromatin (H3.3S31ph) by employing novel histone mutant mouse models. Specifically, our
experiments will enable us to distinguish between several candidate “paths” to H3.3S31ph and amplification of
transcription, including Topoisomerase dependency, and DNA break-dependent and -independent pathways.
In Aim 2 we will identify how DDR-mediated H3.3S31ph uniquely regulates Pol II dynamics at select
inflammatory genes to amplify their transcription. More generally, these studies will identify dedicated
mechanisms that enable inflammatory gene induction with important implications for understanding
inflammation and for informing more selective therapeutic strategies for diverse inflammatory diseases."
10738267,"Project Summary: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/pulmonary emphysema often
develop locomotor muscle dysfunction, which is associated with worse clinical outcomes including higher
mortality. Retention of CO2 in the blood, or hypercapnia, is also frequent in these patients and similarly associated
with higher mortality. The mechanisms that regulate these processes are currently unknown, and the available
treatments have no effects on survival in this setting. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms controlling CO2-
retaining COPD-driven muscle dysfunction could help develop strategies to prevent and reverse that, with
potentially survival and quality of life benefits for these patients. Muscle dysfunction in COPD is associated with
abnormal protein turnover and metabolism. The present application proposes to investigate the contribution of
dysregulated cellular metabolism to the pathophysiology of CO2-retaining COPD. The hypothesis that supports
this application is that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/complex-II subunit-C downregulation represents a
fundamental event in COPD-driven skeletal muscle dysfunction, causing reduced ATP-generation and higher
fatigability; and that hypercapnia attenuates this process via LKB1-AMPK-driven mitochondrial biogenesis. To
investigate that hypothesis, the first aim is dedicated to studying the role of SDHC downregulation in COPD
myopathy using an animal model of COPD-driven skeletal muscle dysfunction we recently published. Genetic
restitution of SDHC will allow gain-of-function to address the mechanisms leading to metabolic dysfunction in
COPD muscles. The second aim of the proposal will investigate the specific mechanisms that regulate CO2-
driven dysfunctional metabolism. As LKB1/AMPK controls CO2 sensing and protein turnover in skeletal muscle,
hypercapnia’s effect on metabolism will be investigated with LKB1 knockout cells and animals exposed to
elevated CO2. We will then blend COPD and CO2 on a single model and perform loss of function with a double
transgenic animal. This research represents a substantive departure from the status quo by focusing on the
contribution of metabolism to the long-term effects of COPD-driven muscle dysfunction, and specifically by
identifying SDHC and AMPK as major players COPD muscle respiration and function."
10738268,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and is associated with significant motor and
non-motor symptoms, traceable to the loss of nigral dopamine neurons in addition to widespread circuit
dysfunction extending beyond the dying nigrostriatal tract. Imaging-based biomarkers play a critical role in
assessing Parkinson’s-related pathological changes, but current biomarkers are limited in their diagnostic and
prognostic ability, particularly in early disease stages when intervention would be most beneficial. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) enables the study of brain activation and has been widely used to study
global functional network changes in Parkinson’s disease. However, standard fMRI is limited in its ability to
robustly measure subtle changes with disease, in part due to low sensitivity and specificity; furthermore,
interpretation of standard fMRI is challenging due to the indirect link between neuronal function and MRI signal
change. This lack of robust direct biomarkers is a critical gap that ultimately limits our ability to understand the
underlying pathological changes, as well as evaluate emerging therapies. To overcome these limitations, we
propose to leverage an advanced multi-contrast fMRI method that provides high contrast sensitivity, as well as
distinct microvascular sensitivity. By coupling this method with pharmacological and chemogenetic
manipulations, a direct link between fMRI-based functional networks and underlying neuronal function can be
inferred. More specifically, this project aims to a) characterize multi-contrast (total vascular and microvascular)
functional connectivity networks in two complementary preclinical models that recapitulate classic hallmarks of
Parkinson’s disease - the progressive PFF synucleinopathy model and the acute 6-OHDA model; b) assess the
effect of pharmacological dopamine modulation on functional networks, using both acute and chronic treatment
paradigms, analogous to the standard treatment paradigm; and c) investigate the effect of endogenous
modulation of the dorsal raphe serotonergic circuit and the locus coeruleus noradrenergic circuit – both of which
are proposed to be involved in certain non-motor symptomology – on functional networks using chemogenetic
methods. These studies will provide insight into functional network changes that occur over different vascular
scales and via different neurotransmitter populations. The development of robust MRI biomarkers that relate to
dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic circuit function and dysfunction may also provide insight into the
multifaceted nature of Parkinson’s disease that contributes to both motor and non-motor symptoms. As functional
brain network dysfunction is widely observed in Parkinson’s disease, this integrative approach will enable the
development of robust biomarkers of Parkinson’s disease with well-characterized pathophysiological origins,
which is a critical shortcoming of current technologies."
10890838,"Relapse is a major clinical challenge in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Relapse is driven in part
by alcohol-induced synaptic plasticity at the corticostriatal circuit. The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) has been
implicated in alcohol seeking and relapse. The DMS contains direct-pathway medium spiny neurons (dMSNs)
and indirect-pathway MSNs (iMSNs), which positively and negatively regulate alcohol seeking, respectively.
Alcohol-associated behaviors such as operant self-administration activate only a relatively small subset of
neuronal ensembles in the striatum. Although alcohol-induced plasticity is much studied in bulk tissue, it is
unknown whether it is induced in dMSN ensembles. Characterizing synaptic mechanisms of the ensemble
neurons is especially vital to reconcile with the decades of evidence for drug-induced synaptic changes detected
in bulk tissue analysis. In addition, extinction training yields greater suppression of alcohol seeking relative to
abstinence alone, but the mechanism is poorly understood. The absence of alcohol delivery during extinction
likely stimulates thalamic inputs to the DMS and reduces striatal dopamine levels, concurrently inducing
thalamostriatal long-term potentiation (LTP) in DMS iMSNs; this enhances “NoGo” actions, suppressing
alcohol seeking during relapse. LTP in iMSNs is also likely to directly or indirectly suppress dMSN activity by
reducing dopaminergic activity. This application aims to elucidate how extinction training reduces alcohol-
induced corticostriatal plasticity in the DMS ensembles and thereby persistently reduces relapse, with the long-
term objective of determining how such strategies can be used to treat alcohol use disorder. They hypothesize
that alcohol-induced corticostriatal plasticity in dMSN ensembles drives relapse and that extinction training
promotes thalamostriatal plasticity in iMSN ensembles to directly or indirectly, via counteracting dMSN
activity, suppress relapse. Three specific research aims will: 1) test the hypothesis that operant alcohol self-
administration causes long-lasting corticostriatal plasticity in DMS dMSN ensembles, promoting relapse; 2)
test the hypothesis that extinction-mediated thalamostriatal plasticity in DMS iMSN contributes to reduced
relapse to alcohol seeking; and 3) test the hypothesis that extinction training potentiates the inhibitory outputs
from iMSNs to dMSNs or the disinhibitory effects of iMSNs on habenula-projecting globus pallidus neurons,
suppressing relapse. This application is highly innovative because it applies state-of-the-art approaches,
including a combination of ArcTRAP, Cal-Light, and dual-channel optogenetic stimulation, allowing us for the
first time to determine how extinguishing alcohol-evoked synaptic plasticity in specific molecularly defined
neuronal ensembles alters their activities in vivo and thus persistently decreases relapse behavior; these critical
questions cannot be addressed using conventional methodologies. Knowledge generated from this proposal
will provide novel strategies for the long-term treatment of alcohol use disorder."

 The goal of this K08 proposal is to provide didactic and experiential training in new techniques needed to
achieve my long-term career goal of developing an independent research program exploring the novel
intersection of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) and alloimmunity. The proposed training will allow me to
develop expertise in animal models of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), T cell functional
assays, bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing data sets, techniques to identify lncRNA-protein
interactions, grant writing, mentorship, and laboratory management. This 5-year training plan will be directed
by my primary mentor, Dr. Pavan Reddy, who is an accomplished transplant immunology physician-scientist
with a track record of successfully mentoring junior faculty. I will also be advised by a committee with expertise
in bioinformatics, RNA biology, molecular genetics, and HSCT immunology. The didactic training program
covers bioinformatics, grant writing, advanced immunology, mentorship, and laboratory management.
 Allogeneic (allo) HSCT is a curative treatment for high-risk hematologic disorders. Acute graft-versus-host
disease (GVHD) is an allo-T cell-driven major complication of allo-HSCT, for which improved treatments are
needed. LncRNAs control gene expression with tissue specificity and fine-tune immune responses. To identify
potential lncRNA regulators of allo-T cells, we recently performed RNA-sequencing on well-annotated clinical
HSCT samples. This work identified LINC00402 as a novel, conserved, T cell-enriched lncRNA that was
differentially expressed by allo-T cells. Functionally, LINC00402 promoted allo-T cell proliferation. However, it
is unknown if LINC00402 exacerbates acute GVHD in vivo and what molecular mechanisms are responsible
for its effects on allo-T cell function. Based on these prior data and additional new observations, this proposal
will test the overall hypothesis that LINC00402 regulates acute GVHD in vivo by enhancing ERK-c-FOS
signaling in CD4 type 1 (Th1) helper cells. This will be tested using complementary murine and human in vitro
and in vivo systems. Aim 1 will determine the cellular mechanisms of LINC00402 in T cell responses and will
test the specific hypothesis that LINC00402 augments Th1 differentiation and the production of Th1 cytokines
by allo-T cells. Aim 2 will define the molecular mechanisms mediating LINC00402’s regulation of T cells and
will test the hypothesis that LINC00402 directly enhances ERK-c-FOS-dependent T cell receptor signaling. It
will also serve as a training platform to learn bioinformatics analysis of next-generation sequencing datasets
and methods to identify lncRNA binding partners. Aim 3 will elucidate the role of LINC00402 in experimental
acute gastrointestinal GVHD, and will explore the hypothesis that LINC00402 enhances acute gastrointestinal
GVHD by promoting accumulation of Th1 cells. This will be tested using complementary xenogeneic and
allogeneic murine models. Altogether, these studies will explore a unique area of alloimmunity and determine if
LINC00402 is a target for improving allo-HSCT outcomes."
10886100,"In Minnesota, American Indian (34.1%) and non-Hispanic Black (33.4%) women are over twice as likely to be
obese during pregnancy than non-Hispanic White women of whom 16.6% are obese during pregnancy. This
high incidence reflects the causes of maternal obesity such as low socioeconomic status, high crime rate, and
excess exposure to air pollution. Maternal obesity has widespread adverse effects on the offspring including
increasing their risk of dying from breast cancer. Maternal obesity also permanently disrupts the mutually
beneficial interaction between the offspring and offspring’s gut microbiota, causing gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis
in the offspring is characterized by a reduction in the gut bacteria that produce fecal short-chain fatty acids
(SCFA). SCFAs play pivotal roles in maintaining healthy immune functions, cellular metabolism, and other critical
functions. These compounds act mostly through their receptors GPR43 and GPR41, which are expressed in
immune cells and multiple other cell types. Here, we will test the central hypothesis that the composition of
commensal gut microbes in the offspring of obese dams is causally responsible for an offspring’s increased
susceptibility to mammary tumorigenesis, an effect that likely also reflects altered immunity. We will test this
causal link by performing fecal microbiota transfers (FMTs). The role of GPR43 and GPR41 in mediating the
impact of maternal obesity on offspring will be tested using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout mice. The potential for
clinical translation of our findings will be established by supplementing obese pregnant dams with a commercially
available probiotic mix of SCFA-producing gut bacteria and dietary fiber that increases SCFA production. Such
a combination has been earlier found to be most effective in reversing loss of critical microbes of healthy gut
microbiota from individuals who have consumed an unhealthy Western diet for multiple generations. We will use
allografted E0771 and Py230 mammary tumor models and MMTV-PyMT mice developing mammary tumors at
about age 3 months. Shotgun metagenome sequencing and mass spectrometry will be applied to study gut
microbiota and their metabolites, respectively. Changes in immune cell infiltration and activity will be measured
in multiple tissues and compared with the expression of GPR43 and GPR41 in immune cells. Our studies could
lead to effective and safe prevention strategies against breast cancer and its growth in the daughters of obese
mothers, and be particularly beneficial for communities suffering from health disparities."
10890866,"Coronary heart diseases remain the leading cause of deaths in the US. Despite the success of lipid lowering,
residual risk remains. Current clinical studies support the participation of inflammation in cardiovascular
diseases (CVD). Eosinophils (EOS) develop in the bone-marrow under the control of transcription factor
GATA1. These granule cells accumulate in blood or at the site of inflammation. Blood EOS counts and EOS
cationic protein (ECP) levels associate positively with the major CVD risk factors, prevalence, and mortality.
Yet other studies reported reduced blood EOS counts and ECP levels in patients with major adverse cardiac
events and heart failure (HF). Therefore, the role for EOS in human CVD remains unsettled. We reported that
patients with hypertension showed positive association between blood EOS counts and hypertrophic measures.
Using transverse aortic constriction (TAC)- and β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (ISO)-induced
cardiac hypertrophy and HF in EOS-deficient ∆dblGATA mice and in diphtheria toxin-induced EOS-depleted
iPHIL mice, we demonstrated a reparative role of EOS in cardiac hypertrophy and HF by producing IL4 and
cationic protein (mEar1). Mechanistic studies reported a role for EOS-derived IL4 and cationic proteins (mEar1,
ECP) in blocking cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis, and in inhibiting cardiac fibroblast TGF-β signaling
and fibrosis. EOS granules contain cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, in addition to cationic proteins. To
avoid ambitious concern, we will only study EOS cationic proteins in this proposal, as many other cells in
hypertrophic heart also express these EOS cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Human EOS cationic
protein ECP was identified 50 years ago and has been used as a biomarker for many human diseases, but it
remains unknown whether and how ECP contributes to human diseases. Our preliminary studies showed that
cardiomyocytes express bone morphogenetic protein receptor BMPR-1A and 1B, but not BMPR-2. In contrast,
cardiac fibroblasts express BMPR-2 but not BMPR-1A or 1B. mEar1 uses BMPR-1A and 1B on
cardiomyocytes as its receptor to activate the Smad-1/5/8 signaling and to block ISO-induced cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy, but uses BMPR-2 on cardiac fibroblasts to block TGF-β-induced Smad2/3 signaling and fibrotic
protein expression. In this proposal, we hypothesize that EOS protect heart from hypertrophy and HF by
releasing cationic proteins to block cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis and to inhibit cardiac fibroblast
activation. EOS cationic proteins (mouse mEar1 and human ECP and EDN) exert their cardioprotective roles
using BMPR-1A and 1B as their receptors on cardiomyocytes and BMPR-2 as their receptor on cardiac
fibroblasts. Maintenance of functional receptors for EOS cationic proteins is essential to the cardioprotective
role of human or mouse EOS. We propose two Aims to explore the molecular mechanisms by which EOS
cationic proteins protect cardiomyocytes from hypertrophic injury and, to explore the molecular mechanisms by
which EOS cationic proteins inhibit cardiac fibroblast fibrotic protein expression."
10738740,"ABSTRACT-PROJECT 1
Previous vaccines have been unable to elicit HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) in humans. Two of
the reasons for this failure are that bnAb precursor B cells are often rare and that the B cell receptors on those
rare B cells require extensive somatic mutation to evolve into high-affinity bnAbs. A subset of these somatic
mutations—termed improbable mutations—have a low probability of being made by the somatic mutation
machinery due to codon bias and positioning of somatic mutation recognition motifs. Our central hypothesis
for eliciting bnAbs is that immunogens must have a higher affinity for Abs with the required improbable
mutations than for Abs lacking these key mutations. Moreover, we hypothesize that mutation-guided vaccine
design will need to engage low-affinity rare bnAb precursors and, then, through immunization with sequential
immunogens, select for Abs acquiring the somatic changes requisite for a broad neutralization phenotype. We
and others have observed that multimerizing HIV-1 envelope (Env) immunogens on nanoparticles (NPs) can
increase Ab titers and affinity maturation of HIV-1 bnAb lineages. However, Env is unstable and can adopt
non-native conformations on the surface of NPs, leading to undesired Ab responses. Additionally, NPs bearing
HIV-1 envelope can be of low protein yield. To overcome these pitfalls, we have developed an innovative,
rapid platform that uses the enzyme sortase A to covalently link well-folded, cleaved Env trimers to self-
assembling ferritin protein NPs. These sortase A-conjugated NPs (scNPs) maintain near-native Env trimer
conformation, allowing avid selection of improbable mutations in evolving bnAb lineages. In humanized mice,
we used a scNP displaying an engineered Env trimer called CH505.M5 G458Y to select for a key improbable
mutation required for maturation of the 8ANC131/CH235 class of CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAbs. The same
scNP elicited CD4bs monoclonal neutralizing Abs and serum neutralizing Abs in nonhuman primates (NHPs).
To further guide these Abs to develop neutralization breadth, we have generated a boosting Env trimer scNP
immunogen called CH505.TF scNP and have a third boosting Env under development. In CH505.M5 G458Y
scNP-primed NHPs, CH505 TF scNP immunization boosts neutralizing Ab titers against multiple CH505
viruses. This IPCAVD will generate a CH505 TF scNP boosting immunogen and a second sequential Env
trimer scNP boosting immunogen for a Phase I trial. In Specific Aim 1, Project 1 will determine an optimal NP
boosting regimen to broaden the neutralization capacity of current CD4bs B cell lineages in humanized mice.
In Specific Aim 2, we will compare conjugation efficiency and immunogenicity of scNPs assembled from
research-grade or development-run ferritin and sortase A components from Project 2. Lastly, Specific Aim 3
will demonstrate the induction of CD4bs lineages in NHPs using the prime-boost strategy and cGMP scNPs
proposed for the Phase I trial. The impact of this Project is that it will define and demonstrate the effectiveness
of a novel, optimal NP vaccine regimen to expand and affinity mature 8ANC131/CH235 class CD4bs bnAbs."

A key goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is to induce long-lasting protective broadly neutralizing antibody
(bnAb) responses that can inhibit HIV-1 infection. However, such protective immune responses have been
difficult to induce in the setting of vaccination. One strategy to induce these protective responses is to present
to the immune system the target for neutralizing antibodies, HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimers in their native form.
Multimerizing Env trimers on nanoparticles (NPs) enhances their immunogenicity, thus a goal for immunogen
design is to present multiple copies of well-folded Env trimers. Env is a metastable protein that adopts multiple
conformations. The primary obstacle facing Env trimer NP vaccines is that Env fusion nanoparticles,
recombinantly expressed as a single polypeptide chain, can adopt a mixture of well-folded and misfolded
conformations. The misfolded Env trimers may induce non-neutralizing antibody responses that change Env
conformation upon binding or compete with bnAb precursors for binding to HIV-1 Env. For HIV-1 Env trimer
NPs to become a rapid and widely-used platform for HIV-1 vaccine design, a nanoparticle platform that easily
incorporates well-folded Env trimers without the need for costly, year-long protein engineering experiments is
needed. To overcome the hurdles of HIV-1 Env nanoparticle vaccines, we have innovated a rapid system for
generating well-folded HIV-1 Env trimer nanoparticles using a sortase A conjugation method. The HIV-1 Env
trimers and ferritin are produced separately and to a high purity, allowing for elimination of misfolded protein.
By mixing HIV-1 Env trimer, ferritin and sortase A enzyme, the HIV-1 Env trimer is covalently linked to the
ferritin nanoparticle. The resulting sortase A-conjugated nanoparticles (scNPs) display the Env trimer in the
desired conformation. The overall goals of Project 2 are to translate sortase A-conjugated nanoparticles into a
cGMP-capable process for generation of viral vaccines against numerous pathogens and to manufacture two
HIV-1 bnAb-targeting immunogens for evaluation in a Phase I trial conducted by the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network (HVTN). To accomplish this goal, we will first determine optimal expression system for ferritin and
sortase A and establish target product profiles for platform production (Aim 1). Then, we will develop,
manufacture, and quality release recombinant sortase A and ferritin platform molecules for the conjugation of
Env stabilized trimer to ferritin nanoparticles (Aim 2). Next, we will cGMP produce and quality release >1 g of
two different stabilized Env trimer scNP drug substances and drug products for toxicology studies and clinical
testing in a Phase I clinical trial (Aim 3). The first Env trimer scNP, CH505 TF Env trimer scNP, will be used as
the first boosting immunogen in a CH505 Env NP sequential vaccine targeting CD4 binding site bnAbs. Finally,
we will produce an additional sequential Env trimer scNP to select for further maturation of the same CD4
binding site bnAb lineage (Aim 3). The impact of translating this platform to cGMP manufacturing is that it will
enable rapid production and quicker testing in clinical trials of high-quality HIV-1 Env trimer NP vaccines."

 Antibiotic resistance is a rapidly growing threat to human health, further exacerbated by the limited
development of new antibiotics. Thus, there is a dire need for research informing the design of new therapeutic
options to counter the rise of antibiotic resistance. Polymyxins are cationic antimicrobial peptides that
associate with the outer membrane of Gram-negative (GN) bacteria through electrostatic interactions and are
considered the last line of defense against multi-drug resistant GN bacterial infections. Yet, resistance to
polymyxins develops often and with relative ease, due to modifications that bacteria have developed as
defenses against antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the innate immune system or secreted by other
bacterial species. Modification of Lipid A, the lipidic anchor of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS or
endotoxin) decorating the outer membrane of GN bacteria, with diverse chemical moieties, is a common
mechanism leading to resistance to antimicrobial agents. In E. coli, S. enterica and P. aeruginosa, “capping”
of the phosphates of Lipid A with an aminoarabinose moiety (L-Ara4N) is the predominant modification leading
to resistance against polymyxins and AMPs. The aminoarabinose “cap” is synthesized by GN bacteria through
an enzymatic relay of eight proteins collectively called the aminoarabinose biosynthetic pathway. The
mechanistic basis of function for the membrane enzymes of the pathway is poorly understood, in large part
due to the technical challenges associated with studying enzymes that function at or near the membrane and
utilize lipidic substrates. As part of this research program, we will use a variety of experimental techniques,
including cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), mutagenesis, bacterial growth assays, bacterial genetics, and
microscale thermophoresis (MST), to achieve the following core goals: (1) Structure determination and
substrate-binding characterization for the three bona fide membrane enzymes that operate in the
aminoarabinose biosynthetic pathway (the polyprenol phosphate glycosyltransferase ArnC, the deformylase
ArnD and the lipid-to-lipid glycosyltransferase ArnT), and (2) Investigating the mechanistic basis of enzymatic
function, metal cofactor coordination, and catalysis, in each of the three membrane enzymes under study.
The research program will leverage our multidisciplinary training in membrane protein biochemistry and
structural biology, and experience gained from having successfully solved several structures of the enzyme
ArnT bound to different lipidic substrates. The impact of the program lies within its potential to: i) Provide
detailed mechanistic insights into the structural basis of a diverse set of enzymatic functions responsible for
aminoarabinose biosynthesis and polymyxin resistance in GN bacteria, ii) Advance our understanding of
protein-lipid interactions with undecaprenyl phosphate, as all three enzymes under study utilize undecaprenyl
phosphate as either a donor or acceptor substrate, and iii) Inform structure-based drug design of compounds
capable of restoring susceptibility to polymyxins by targeting enzymes of the aminoarabinose pathway."

disproportionately borne by African Americans with one out of every 365 African-Americans affected. SCD
patients experience vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) as acute bouts of pain. Currently, the only cure for SCD is a
bone marrow transplant but the cost and difficulty of this procedure results in SCD patients often choosing to
instead manage their disease with treatments and routine monitoring. However, there is currently no objective
measure or lab test to determine VOCs and associated pain severity. Routine monitoring of red blood cell (RBC)
health, however, could provide a window for avoiding VOCs and enable more thorough, quantitative analysis of
therapeutic interventions.
The goal of this project is to create a prototype device suitable for use at the point of care for monitoring SCD
patients by advancing a novel technology for rapid, automated, high throughput red blood cell (RBC) imaging.
The approach is based on quantitative phase imaging (QPI) to create a hologram of every individual RBC in a
sample. These imaging data can then be evaluated for the proportion of sickled cells using machine learning.
Further, since up to 10^6 RBCs are imaged in each sample, a large volume of data will be obtained, suitable for
developing AI algorithms that can reveal additional information. Significantly, the device is compact and low
cost, indicating that there is significant potential for translation to a point of care device. In this project, we will
seek to translate our technology, with demonstrated high throughput imaging capabilities, to realize a prototype
device suitable for use in clinical trials. They key development steps include development of the imaging device
to enable a robust, compact form factor, advancing the design of the microfluidic device that carries the RBC's
and creating new and improved algorithms to enable high throughput segmentation and analysis of the obtained
imaging data. The output will be a prototype device for assessing the RBC health of individuals based using a
small blood draw which can be analyzed locally to enable treatment decisions more quickly."

 This proposal describes a 4-year career mentored research project with the goal of defining the effects of
intestinal Intelectin-1 (ITLN1) in microbial function and composition and its role in the genesis of obesity and
early life weight gain. Successful completion of the research and training plan will enable the investigator to gain
the skills necessary to secure independent funding and become an independent physician-scientist. The inves-
tigator's long-term goal is to define how the host-microbiota interface modulates the risk of obesity early in life
through multidisciplinary approaches and enable the design of preventative obesity strategies starting in the
neonatal period. The research aims and career development plan will work towards mastery and independence
in gnotobiology, gut anaerobic microbiology, and preclinical models of metabolism and proficiency in functional
and bioinformatic analysis of the microbiota and translational research in early life. The primary co-mentors are
Dr. Richard S. Blumberg – an expert in mucosal immunology and preclinical models to study gut-microbiota
interactions – and Dr. Alessio Fasano – a leader in pediatric translational studies in the host-microbiome interface
–at Mass General Brigham/Harvard Medical School. The collaborative and mentorship team comprises a local,
multi-institutional group of experts in bioinformatics, intestinal microbial ecology, mucosal immunology, metabo-
lism, and childhood obesity. The research proposal seeks to explore interactions between intestinal ITLN1 and
microbes in the genesis of obesity. ITLN1 has been associated with obesity in humans, but the mechanism(s)
behind(s) this association are unknown. The preliminary findings suggest that ITLN1 binds a particular subset of
bacteria in vivo and modulates the metabolic activity of the microbiome. Furthermore, intestinal ITLN1 might
protect against obesity in a microbiota-dependent manner. The overall hypothesis of this mentored research is
that intestinal ITLN1 protects from obesity by modulating the metabolic activity of ITLN1-bound bacteria. In this
proposal, we will use in vitro transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis of ITLN1-bound bacteria and bottom-up and
bottom down microbiological approaches in conventional and gnotobiotic mice with and without ITLN1 to under-
stand the effects of ITLN1 on intestinal microbes and seek to provide critical information about mechanisms by
which ITLN1 in the intestine can influence the host-susceptibility to obesity. Furthermore, the applicant will ex-
plore the translational implication of ITLN1 binding to microbes in infants with adequate and excessive weight
gain during the first two years of life, as rapid weight gain in this critical window is associated with childhood
obesity. Expected outcomes include direct evidence that loss of a single protein (ITLN1) in the intestinal epithe-
lium leads to obesity and metabolic syndrome through its effects on the microbiota and the development of the
investigator's expertise in the mechanistic study of the host-microbiota interface in obesity and translational stud-
ies in early life. This career development award will set the stage for an independent research career focused
on developing strategies to prevent and treat obesity targeting the host-microbiota interface in early life."

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is devastating. Even in the setting of curable disease, 1 of every 2 patients
diagnosed ultimately succumb. Additionally, survivors are left with debilitating toxicity due in large part to the
toxicity of radiation, leading to poor quality of life increased rates of depression and suicide. Therefore, there is
a critical need to develop precision oncology approaches which match radiation treatment approaches to HNC
biology.
HPV-associated (HPV+) HNC most commonly arises in the oropharynx (OPC) and is associated with much
greater sensitivity to radiation. However, up to 20% of patients with HPV+ tumors will also be failed by
radiation. Conversely, HPV- HNC that express p16 exhibit favorable outcomes compared to truly p16 negative
tumors. This proposal seeks to understand why this is so. Specifically, we have identified the protein p16, a
clinical surrogate for HPV, to be driving response to radiation and PARP inhibition outside of its usual cell cycle
regulatory function, by inhibiting DNA damage repair (DDR).
Although p16 is generally thought to be functionally inactive in HPV+ HNC, and absent in HPV- HNC, our data
suggests that p16 is functioning via non-canonical signaling in HNC to induce a state of BRCAness and is key
to understanding the differential radiation response in HPV+ and HPV- tumors. In this proposal we build upon
the substantial data we have generated for a non-canonical p16-mediated pathway active in HNC – leading to
upregulation of HUWE1, downregulation of USP7 and a shift in DDR – by first characterizing the relationship
between p16 and Sp1. Although, we have linked Sp1 to the activation of our non-canonical p16 signaling
pathway, as well as outcome in HNC following the combination of cisplatin and radiation, the nature of this
interaction is unclear. We will both characterize this interaction as well as utilize state-of-the-art methodology to
globally characterize the effects of p16 and Sp1 on mRNA and protein levels within HNC pre-clinical models
and patient tumors. We will then comprehensively examine the relationship between p16 and Sp1 on DDR and
radiation or Olaparib response using a combination of immunodeficient and -competent murine orthotopic
models as well as 400 HPV+ and HPV- OPC tumors treated uniformly with cisplatin and radiation in the largest
cohort of its kind to date. Finally, we will utilize USP7 inhibitors in clinical development in combination with
either radiation or PARP inhibition in pre-clinical models.
Completion of this project will establish biomarkers of outcome in both HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC downstream
of p16, evaluate USP7 as a viable target for sensitization to radiation and Olaparib, and identify novel targets
for precision medicine in HNC."

 Improving access to surgical care remains a persistent challenge in the United States. While some
areas of the country are crowded with high-intensity resources, more than a third of US counties do not have a
single surgeon. Even in areas where there are enough providers, more than 29 million American lack
insurance coverage preventing access to elective surgical care. As a result of a limited surgical workforce,
inadequate insurance coverage or both, patients with limited access delay care until the condition requires
emergent intervention. These emergency operations, that are more costly than their elective counterparts due
to more complication and readmissions, are estimated to account for more than $1 billion in preventable
spending. In response, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implemented multiple access
strategies including broader insurance coverage (e.g. Medicaid Expansion) and workforce incentives (e.g.
Health Profession Shortage Areas (HPSA)). By improving access, the policies are meant to facilitate elective
surgical care, prevent adverse events and reduce episode spending. Because the CMS policies outlined here
focus on improving access, we will evaluate a broad range access sensitive surgical conditions. These
conditions are preferentially treated with elective, or scheduled, operations when access is optimal. However,
when access is limited, their natural progression leads to unresolving symptoms that ultimately require an
emergency surgical procedure. Examples include abdominal aortic aneurysms which can rupture, ventral
hernias which can strangulate, and colorectal cancers that can cause life-threatening obstructions. As such,
these operations being performed electively versus emergently can serve as an indicator of access. Each CMS
policy was implemented with both geographic and temporal variation resulting in beneficiaries exposed to one
policy, both policies or neither. We will exploit these overlapping natural experiments to understand and isolate
the effects of each policy alone as well as their combined effects using administrative claims from Medicare
Claims and Healthcare Costs Utilization Project. We will leverage our extensive experience with natural
experiment study design to appropriately isolate the effects of each policy on surgical access, quality and
costs. This study will bring important evidence to evidence-based policy making as many states are still
adopting Medicaid Expansion and congress debates the merits of continued HPSA subsidies."

Hemeproteins play vital transport, enzymatic, and signaling roles that fundamentally impact our cardiovascular,
pulmonary, digestive, neurological, and immune systems. Cells must transport mitochondrial heme to proteins
that mature and function outside the mitochondria. Our goal is to understand how intracellular heme delivery
takes place and is regulated in mammals. Cytosolic heme delivery proteins have been postulated but their
identities are unclear. We found that GAPDH binds mitochondrially-generated heme and that its heme binding
is essential for delivery to eight different hemeprotein targets. We hypothesize that GAPDH-dependent heme
delivery is fundamental for hemeprotein function, and we propose to discern mechanisms, scope, and
regulation of GAPDH-dependent heme delivery. Our experiments utilize purified proteins and cell culture,
which provides a facile path to molecular-level discoveries and a robust means to validate their biological
relevance. We have ways to control cell heme production, monitor GAPDH-heme binding and transfer in live
cells and between proteins, assess heme delivery to targets, characterize GAPDH-target complexes, and
determine their relevance for heme delivery.
AIM 1. How does GAPDH participate in intracellular heme delivery? We hypothesize GAPDH may bind
directly to the target proteins to deliver heme and found it does so with at least four proteins (apo-sGCβ, IDO1,
TDO, and Mb) in cells and purified form. We will: (i) identify interface regions in each GAPDH-hemeprotein
complex using HDx-MS, MS-cleavable crosslinking, and NMR approaches; (ii) use mutagenesis to test the role
of GAPDH-target protein contacts in heme deliveries; (iii) structurally characterize the GAPDH-heme complex
and GAPDH-hemeprotein complexes by crystallography and single particle EM; (iv) utilize a GAPDH-biolD2-HA
fusion protein to biotinylate intermediate or middleman proteins that associate with GAPDH during heme
transfers; (v) deploy GAPDH surface charge mutants to independently probe GAPDH-target binding and role in
heme transfers; (vi) perform heme transfer experiments with purified GAPDH & target proteins; (vii) screen for
GAPDH-dependent heme deliveries to cell heme exporters (FLVCR1a & ABCG2), cytochrome P450’s (CYP2D6
& CYP3A4), two peroxidases (LPO & EPO), an NADPH oxidase (NOX5), and heme oxygenases 1 & 2.
AIM 2. What controls GAPDH heme acquisition & deliveries? Cell & molecular mechanisms that control
GAPDH heme acquisition and release are unknown. We will: (i) determine if mitochondrial heme exporter
FLVCR1b and/or ER heme exporter PGRMC2 is a heme source for GAPDH; (ii) test if GAPDH heme acquisition
involves direct interaction with the exporters; (iii) investigate if GAPDH-heme level in cells is regulated by cell
heme exporters FLVCR1a & ABCG2; (iv) examine if post-translational GAPDH modification, chaperone hsp90,
or azole drugs control GAPDH heme acquisition and delivery."

The goal of the proposed K99/R00 award is to support Dr. Courtney Choy’s development into an independent
community-engaged implementation scientist, with a focus on epidemiology and leveraging quantitative and
qualitative data to address noncommunicable, cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk in Pacific Islander children.
Although they are among the most at risk of CMD, few efficacious interventions or innovations to address CMDs
have reached Pacific Islander communities. The objective of this proposal is to develop and implement a context-
specific, multi-component intervention to address CMD risk in Samoan children. Samoa, a middle-income
Polynesian country with a large global diaspora, experiences among the highest CMD prevalence in the world.
Existing data from the Ola Tuputupua’e (‘Growing Up’) cohort study, which this proposal will leverage, suggests
that risk emerges early in life. Half of the enrolled children were affected by either obesity, elevated blood
pressure, and/or high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by the age of 9. During the K99 training phase, Dr. Choy
will (1) extend her epidemiological training and use growth mixture modeling to inform intervention targets and
timing and (2) gain new skills in qualitative methods, and implementation science to select and contextually adapt
an intervention for use in Samoa. The Active Implementation Frameworks and evidence-based best practices in
Pacific Islander communities will guide intervention development and implementation, which will take place in
the R00 phase. The result will be a multi-component intervention for Samoan children that targets the age period
in which markers of CMD risk (body mass index, blood pressure, and HbA1c) are most sensitive to modifiable
behavioral and environmental risk factors. Further, the multi-component intervention will incorporate at least two
evidence-based lifestyle/behavioral change strategies to address CMD risk factors, utilize existing infrastructure
and local capacity (with an implementation team) and align with community-identified priorities. Preliminary
evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the developed intervention among children in
Samoa will produce a scalable program with the potential for replication in other Pacific Islander populations and
comparable low-resource settings. To achieve career development goals and ensure a successful transition to
independence, Dr. Choy has established an exceptional training environment, developed experiential learning
activities to apply newly gained skills from didactic coursework, and assembled a multidisciplinary mentorship
team with expertise in public health, implementation science, clinical trials, human biology, epidemiology, and
Pacific Islander health. The mentorship, research training, leadership and career development activities
proposed will ensure that at the conclusion of this award, Dr. Choy will be well-positioned to extend the methods
developed to Pacific Islanders in the US, who are among the fastest-growing racial and ethnic minority groups
and –because of their high CMD risk– are the ideal beneficiaries of early intervention to reduce health disparities."
10742908,"Type II topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that are required for proper chromosome structure and
segregation and play important roles in DNA replication, transcription, and recombination. These enzymes
relax DNA and remove knots and tangles from the genetic material by passing an intact double helix (transport
segment) through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment (gate
segment). Humans encode two closely related isoforms of the type II enzyme, topoisomerase IIα and
topoisomerase IIβ. Topoisomerase IIα is essential for the survival of proliferating cells and topoisomerase IIβ
plays critical roles during development. However, because these enzymes generate requisite double-stranded
DNA breaks during their crucial catalytic functions, they assume a dual persona. Although essential to cell
survival, they also pose an intrinsic threat to genomic integrity every time they act.
 Beyond their critical physiological functions, topoisomerase IIα and IIβ are the primary targets for some of
the most active and widely prescribed drugs currently used for the treatment of human cancers. These agents
kill cells by stabilizing covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes (cleavage complexes) that are
normal, but fleeting, intermediates in the catalytic DNA strand passage reaction. When the resulting enzyme-
associated DNA breaks are present in sufficient concentrations, they can trigger cell death pathways.
Anticancer drugs that target type II enzymes are referred to as topoisomerase II poisons because they convert
these indispensable enzymes to potent physiological toxins that generate DNA damage in treated cells.
 Although topoisomerase IIα and IIβ are important targets for cancer chemotherapy, they also have the
potential to trigger specific leukemias. For example, a small percentage of patients with cancer or multiple
sclerosis who are treated with the topoisomerase II-targeted drug mitoxantrone go on to develop acute
promyelocytic leukemias (APLs) with 15:17 translocations.
Despite the importance of type II topoisomerases in cell growth and cancer, we still have much to learn about
how the human enzymes function and interact with DNA and anticancer drugs. Thus, this proposal will further
define the catalytic mechanism of type II topoisomerases and examine how enzyme activity is regulated in the
cell. It also will define mechanisms by which established and novel topoisomerase II-targeted agents, environ-
mental chemicals, and natural products increase levels of enzyme-mediated DNA breaks or inhibit enzyme
activity and determine the cellular consequences of topoisomerase II poisons. The primary research models for
this study will be human topoisomerase IIα and IIβ, cultured human cells, and Xenopus laevis egg extracts.
Gyrase and topoisomerase IV from Escherichia coli and Bacillus anthracis will be used as counterpoints to
mechanistic experiments and Mycobacterium tuberculosis gyrase will be used to assess relationships between
the mechanisms of action of drugs targeted to prokaryotic and eukaryotic type II enzymes."
10742910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD8 T cells play a critical role in the elimination of infected and cancerous host cells. The success of these
immune responses depends on the proper maintenance (survival and proliferation) and precise differentiation of
CD8 T cells. Upon antigen stimulation, activated antigen-specific CD8 T cells undergo clonal expansion and
differentiate into effector lymphocytes with cytolytic function. Although the majority of effector cells die after
antigen clearance, a few antigen-specific cells survive and form long-lived protective memory CD8 T cells.
However, during chronic infection and cancer, the immune response is often compromised: CD8 T cells exhibit
defects in survival and proliferation, fail to form memory cells and instead are diverted to differentiate into
exhausted cells which are characterized by the loss of effector function. Thus, it is of utmost importance to
understand the underlying mechanisms that regulate the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells. We
have already demonstrated that let-7-mediated posttranscriptional mechanism controls the differentiation and
function of effector T cells. Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that modulation of let-7 levels have a
profound impact on the maintenance of T cells, memory formation and diversion into exhaustion. To investigate
the molecular mechanisms of let-7 regulation in CD8 T cells we propose the following aims:
Aim-1 will determine the molecular basis of let-7-mediated effects on CD8 T cell maintenance: bcl-2-dependent
survival and cdc34-driven proliferation. Aim-2 will dissect let-7-mediated mechanisms that guide CD8 T cell
differentiation: Eomes-dependent and Eomes-independent molecular programs. To address these aims we will
analyze the maintenance and differentiation of CD8 T cells with different levels of let-7 microRNAs into effector,
memory and exhausted T lymphocytes using infection and tumor models. We expect to identify novel
posttranscriptional mechanisms that regulate the outcome of CD8 T cell-mediated immune responses. It is
anticipated that these experiments will define let-7 as a new therapeutic target."

Youth from resettled refugee families are at elevated risk of developing serious mental health challenges
compared to their U.S. native peers. Studies have found that refugee youth living in high income countries have
high prevalence of trauma-associated mental disorders like PTSD, (19% to 54%) and depression (3% to 30%).
Additionally, youth belonging to these vulnerable communities have high rates of substance use, school dropout,
incarcerations, violence including gang-related homicides, with suicides emerging as a serious public health
threats. The purpose of this K01 is to provide the candidate with formal training and mentoring in: (1)
systematically adapting and implementing community-based interventions; (2) collection, management, and
analysis of qualitative and mixed methods data; and (3) advanced implementation science research, including
the application of theories and frameworks, methods for identifying and prioritizing implementation determinants,
and systematic approaches to developing and testing implementation strategies. This training will prepare the
candidate for independent research conducting multidisciplinary research that develops and tests community-
based interventions aimed at addressing the myriad of mental health challenges among youth in resettled
refugee communities. Accordingly, the candidate will conduct a type 1hybrid effectiveness-implementation
trial to test a combination intervention designed to improve intergenerational trauma-related mental health
symptoms among second generation refugee children (SGRC). Guided by Social Action and Family Systems
theories, and applying them to the ITT framework, the proposed combination intervention consists of: family
strengthening (FS) model delivered through multiple family groups (MFG) + peer mentoring program called
TeenAge Health Consultants (TAHC) adapted for delivery in virtual environment (Virtual TAHC). The intervention
will have the following specific aims: (1) systematically adapt an evidence-based family strengthening (FS) model
delivered through multiple family groups (MFG) combined with a peer mentoring program (Virtual TAHC) (Goal
1); (2) assess preliminary short- and long-term impact of the combination intervention (MFG + Virtual TAHC) on
behavioral emotional disorders (aggressive behavior, antisocial behaviors, anxiety, depression, and PTSD)
related to intergenerational trauma among SGRC in the trial (Goal 2); and (3) utilizing mixed methods and
applying the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, examine implementation
strategies, facilitators, and barriers of the RRF4H intervention (Goal 3). Given the transdiagnostic application of
the intervention, this study is significant because it has potential to advance our understanding on how to mitigate
the intergenerational impact of war trauma among children who have not directly experienced war trauma."

Multiple recent studies have provided proof-of-concept that a “functional cure” of HIV-1 infection,
i.e. long-term control of HIV without continued treatment, is achievable. The VISCONTI study
identified 14 HIV+ patients, who received antiretroviral treatment (ART) during primary HIV-1
infection, and maintained post-treatment control (PTC) of their virus below the limit of detection
for a median of 89 months after stopping therapy. The CHAMP (Control of HIV after Antiretroviral
Medication Pause) study has identified 67 post-treatment controllers from 14 treatment
interruption studies involving more than 700 participants.
To determine why some individuals control HIV to undetectable or low levels after treatment
discontinuation, we need a better understanding of the factors that lead to establishment of viral
reservoirs, that determine its size, the dynamics of its maintenance and its reactivation possibly
leading to viral rebound after treatment cessation. Here we propose to develop a set of new
models to help understand the factors that led to functional cure in the studies mentioned
above and to understand more generally how functional cure can be achieved. We will
collaborate with leading experimental scientists, who will provide novel datasets allowing us to
fulfil the following specific aims. Aim 1. To understand the mechanism of HIV latent reservoir
establishment and the factors determining the rate of reservoir seeding during acute
infection. We will develop mechanistic models of early reservoir establishment. We will test these
models against rich datasets collected by collaborators and estimate key parameter values to
accurately describe the dynamics of reservoir establishment. With the insights gained, we will
extend the model to interpret recent data39 on the seeding, turnover and the genetic composition
of the reservoir. Aim 2. To understand in quantitative detail the factors that determine the
duration of post-treatment control after ART interruption. We will study new models that
account for patient specific factors such as the ART regime and the level of cell-associated RNA
at the time of ATI in predicting time to viral rebound after ATI. When the time to rebound is long,
we aim to elucidate new factors such as a time-dependent rate of reservoir reactivation or immune
control that lead to prolonged PTC. Aim 3. Using insights gained from mathematical modeling
to propel the cure agenda for HBV. We will leverage previous modeling successes of HIV and
HCV infection to develop a new generation of models of HBV infection and study the effects of
different therapies singly and in combination."
10742916,"ABSTRACT
Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are believed to be a self-renewing cell population without a requirement of replenishment
from extra-pulmonary sources in healthy adult mice; however, the mechanism(s) involved and whether replenishment
occurs by stimulating the proliferation of progenitors or mature AMs are not known. We reported that lung levels of
granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) control long-term maintenance of macrophages trans-
planted into the lungs (via a reciprocal feedback loop) as well as endogenous AMs. My preliminary data demonstrate that
GM-CSF is a critical regulator of AM mitochondrial turnover, integrity and functions and is required for fatty acid oxidation-
derived energy production, processes vital to cell proliferation. Prior studies in a leukemia cell line (TF-1) suggest the
pleotropic effects of GM-CSF on macrophages may be mediated by biphasic, ligand concentration-dependent receptor
signaling, i.e., low levels of GM-CSF promote survival and differentiation (but not proliferation) while high levels also stim-
ulate proliferation. Our long-term goal is to determine mechanisms responsible for AM self-renewal. The objective here
is to elucidate the mechanism by which GM-CSF regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis controls AM self-renewal. Cen-
tral Hypothesis: AMs are maintained by homeostatic self-renewal driven by GM-CSF threshold-triggered/concentration-
dependent, niche-limited proliferation of mature (long-lived) AMs (not progenitors). Rationale: This hypothesis was de-
veloped based on my reported and preliminary data demonstrating GM-CSF deficiency results in reduced mitochondrial
metabolism and integrity despite increased mitochondrial mass. Approach: I will utilize complementary genetic and phar-
macologic tools, in vivo and ex vivo studies (with isolated AMs), and pathway-specific inhibitors to pursue two Specific
Aims: 1) Ontogeny and transcriptional control of AM renewal, and 2) Role of GM-CSF regulated mitochondrial metabolism
in AM renewal. The expected results will inform cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF regulates AM
population size and will lay the foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies to modulate AM population size.
The proposed research is innovative, in my opinion, because it challenges the previously widely-held concept of AMs as
short-lived, non-dividing cells replenished from circulating monocytes (regulated by M-CSF) – and instead posits that AM
population size is maintained by homeostatic self-renewal mediated by GM-CSF threshold-triggered/concentration-de-
pendent, niche-limited proliferation of mature (long-lived) AMs. My novel preliminary data identified GM-CSF dependent
regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis as a molecular mechanism for AM self-renewal. In addition, utilization of novel
mouse models and novel methodologies will enable determination of how GM-CSF regulation of mitochondrial homeosta-
sis regulates AM proliferation and will identify the regulatory genes and their downstream targets responsible for long-
term maintenance of AMs. The proposed research is significant because it will advance our knowledge of a critical pulmo-
nary hormone (GM-CSF) by informing the mechanism(s) by which GM-CSF regulates the long-term maintenance of endog-
enous and transplanted AMs and inform us on the therapeutic mechanism of action of PMT, a novel cell therapy in devel-
opment to treat patients with hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and potentially other lung diseases."
10932435,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Through the research and training described in this K01 proposal, the P.I. (Dr. El-Sabawi) will acquire
the necessary skills to become an independent researcher who uses legal epidemiological methods to study
and design evidence-based laws and policies that improve the health of persons who use drugs (PWUD).
Overdose deaths are surging across the U.S., with 40 states reporting increases in mortalities for the 12 month
period ending in May 2022. Some prosecutors have responded to local overdose crises by charging persons
who distribute drugs that cause an overdose death with homicide (drug-induced homicide) (DIH), resulting in
dramatic increases in DIH prosecutions since 2011. Prior research has demonstrated that increased police
activity and enforcement of criminal laws are largely ineffective in decreasing drug use and often lead to poorer
public health outcomes for PWUD. However, the effects of the prosecutorial implementation of DIH laws on
public health remains largely unstudied —equally as unstudied is the relationship between prosecutorial actors
and the local public health and treatment infrastructure. With this 5-year K01, the P.I. aims to examine the
prosecutor’s role in addressing the overdose crisis by focusing on how policy implementation decision-making
is affected by socio-ecological (S.E.) factors, including the presence of other organizations (public health
departments and treatment infrastructure); organizational relationships between the criminal legal, public
health, and treatment systems; and the perceived effect of such prosecutions on drug use and treatment-
seeking behaviors. The P.I. will conduct exploratory semi-structured interviews of prosecutors (AIM 1), local
public health administrators, members of local management entities, defense attorneys, and PWUD (AIM 2) in
North Carolina to capture the S.E. factors present in localities where prosecutors have chosen to pursue DIH
cases versus the factors present in localities where prosecutors have chosen not to pursue such charges.
Using the data gathered in AIMs 1 & 2, the P.I. will develop a Socio-Ecological Model (SEM) of policy
implementation explaining how S.E. factors (including public health and treatment infrastructure) influence the
implementation of DIH laws and how such implementation is perceived to influence the behaviors and
experiences of PWUD (AIM 3). The P.I. will work with an accomplished, multidisciplinary mentorship team (Dr.
Taxman, Dr. Rudes, and Prof. Beletsky) to master four relevant areas of training: (1) policy implementation
science, (2) advanced legal epidemiological evaluation, (3) qualitative interviewing, and (4) implementation
study design. In doing so, this K01 award advances the development of the P.I. as an independent and
productive researcher. The research presented in this K01 award addresses an important public health
concern and has the potential to advance the field by developing a SEM that posits how criminal legal actors
interact with the public health infrastructure in ways that impact the public health of people at risk of overdoses."

position of Assistant Professor of Neurology at the University of North Carolina, where she is pursuing her
research and clinical interests in non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dr. Sklerov’s long-term
career goal is to become a leading independent clinical researcher in developing novel treatments for
neuropsychiatric symptoms of neurologic and psychiatric diseases. The training plan, created in conjunction with
her mentors and advisors, will allow the applicant to achieve her goals: 1) To obtain training in the use of
electroencephalography (EEG) in brain stimulation research, 2) To gain experience in the use and applications
of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), 3) To expand her knowledge and experience in clinical trial design,

Research: Apathy, or lack of enthusiasm or concern for things that were previously interesting, is a common
and debilitating motivational disturbance in neurologic and psychiatric diseases. Apathy is linked to higher levels
of cognitive impairment, depression, care partner stress levels, and more severe psychiatric and neurologic
disease, and is often refractory to treatment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a form non-invasive brain
stimulation, is effective in treating depression when targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) but has
had limited study in apathy. Disruption in medial brain structures, such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), is a common finding in motivational disorders, regardless of underlying
disease. Medial brain structures are preferentially affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD) on pathologic
examination, while other brain regions, such as the DLPFC, are spared. The overarching goal of the proposed
research is to develop apathy TMS targets. Aim 1 will investigate change in performance of an incentivized
motivational task (a measure of apathy) in response to TMS targeting the mPFC. Aim 2 will investigate the use
of electroencephalography (EEG) as a surrogate measure of target engagement. Developing a brain stimulation
target for apathy has the potential to improve quality of life and disease course for millions of Americans
struggling with psychiatric and neurologic illness. Completing the research and training proposed here will allow
the applicant to obtain the preliminary data and expertise necessary to build her innovative research program
and apply for R01 level funding. We expect that this research will improve our understanding of refractory apathy,
and promote development of a widely-available and safe therapeutic option for apathy."

Human tryptophan dioxygenase (hTDO) and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 (hIDO1) are two hemeproteins
that catalyze the dioxygenation reaction of L-tryptophan (Trp) to N-formyl kynurenine. Although it is
generally believed that electrons and protons are crucial for oxygen activation by hemeproteins, the
dioxygenases are so unique that they catalyze the oxidative ring cleavage reaction of Trp without consuming
any electrons or protons. With time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy, combined with QM/MM
simulations, we have established a substrate-assisted mechanism accounting for the unusual chemistry
catalyzed by the dioxygenases. Recently, we discovered that, in addition to the Trp dioxygenation activity,
hTDO can bind NAD(P)H in the active site, thereby repurposing it for (i) a heme oxygenase (HO) reaction,
which converts the active holoprotein to the inactive apoprotein, (ii) an oxidase reaction, which reduces O2 to
superoxide, and (iii) a peroxidase reaction, which reduces H2O2 to water. Although hTDO and hIDO1 share
a common active site structure and catalyze the Trp dioxygenation reaction with the same mechanism, hIDO1
does not exhibit the HO activity, but it retains the oxidase and peroxidase activities. These exciting new
findings expand the substrate portfolio and the catalytic repertoire of the heme-based dioxygenases. The major
goal of this project is to decipher the structural determinants dictating the novel enzymatic activities of the two
dioxygenases. The scientific premise of this project is that the comprehension of the new enzymatic activities
of hTDO and hIDO1 will further our knowledge in heme oxygen chemistry and provide new insights into their
physiological functions, thereby offering guidelines for disease control and prevention."

Uncontrolled inflammation is a key driver of acute and chronic cardiovascular pathology.
However, the accompanying edema, one of the four cardinal signs of inflammation defined by
Celsus and Galen two millennia ago, is poorly understood and often ignored at the mechanistic
level. Yet ample evidence shows its causal roles in ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and
resultant sequelae in the heart, brain, and other organs.
While a number of molecules can induce edema formation, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), also known as vascular permeability factor (VPF) has been viewed as the key
component of IRI-associated edema development. There are a number of drugs capable of
blocking VEGF signaling, including vascular permeability that are widely used as anti-
angiogenic cancer and ophthalmologic drugs such as bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib and
pazopanib among others. However, none of them can be used in acute/chronic ischemia
settings due to the induced loss of blood vasculature.
Exciting new data from our lab have demonstrated that it is possible to selectively block VEGF-
induced permeability defects without affecting other aspects of its signaling, thereby eliminating
anti-angiogenic effects of non-selective anti-VEGF therapies. In preliminary studies, blocking
VEGF-blocking edema formation leads to a ~50% reduction in the size of myocardial infarction
and preservation of LV systolic and diastolic function and suppression of VT inducibility. With
these preliminary results in hand, we propose to examine the functional effects myocardial
edema and evaluate the effect of anti-edema therapies in this setting."

Addressing the rising trends in maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) is a critical priority in
the United States. About half of adverse maternal health outcomes were found to be attributable to preventable
harm or unintended consequences arising from clinical practice and the system of delivering perinatal care.
Significant resources are currently being invested to implement quality improvement (QI) initiatives in birthing
hospitals across the country. There is great need to evaluate these efforts and demonstrate their effectiveness
to reducing the burden of preventable SMM and maternal deaths. Virtually all QI initiatives in birthing hospitals
use SMM as an outcome measure, but their evaluation is hindered by the need to risk-adjust SMM rates to
control for differences in patient composition within and between hospitals. To date, 3 different research groups
proposed obstetric comorbidity indices, yet all have significant limitations. The overarching goal of this study is
to develop and validate a refined comorbidity index for obstetric patients that allows SMM rate comparisons
across hospitals and adequate monitoring of QI initiatives in obstetrics. We will use Maryland’s unique, gold-
standard, hospital-based, state-representative SMM Surveillance and Review data to identify a comprehensive
list of comorbidities in patients with SMM events. Using electronic health record data from the Johns Hopkins
Health System, we will employ variable importance estimation with machine learning techniques to develop the
comorbidity index. Subsequently, we will ascertain its accuracy using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC)/precision-recall (PR) curves and areas under the curve (AUC) for outcome discrimination and lowess-
smoothed calibration plots. Also, we will compare the performance of the refined comorbidity index to predict
SMM against that of previously published comorbidity indices. To further validate our refined comorbidity index
and assesses its performance consistency across various sociodemographic groups, we will use national
hospital discharge data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s National Inpatient Sample. A
Technical Advisory Group comprised of clinicians, community partners, patient safety experts, and certified
medical coders will meet quarterly for data interpretation sessions. At the end of the study, we expect to have a
refined comorbidity index developed in gold-standard data, with superior psychometric properties than the
previously published comorbidity indices and validated in both EHR and national hospital discharge data. Our
results will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature and through presentations at scientific meetings."
10851791,"SUMMARY
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a critical congenital heart malformation that typically requires intervention soon
after birth and affects about 1,660 newborns per year in the US. In TOF, blood flow through the pulmonary
artery is reduced or blocked (due to pulmonary stenosis or atresia), while blood flow through the aorta is
increased. Prenatally, TOF-induced abnormal blood flow progressively leads to pathological cardiac valve
tissue remodeling. The semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valve leaflets and the great arteries (the aorta and
pulmonary artery) are particularly susceptible to abnormal blood flow. This is because fetal stages are a critical
time when extracellular matrix components that dictate valve integrity and function, such as collagen and
elastin, deposit and organize within valve tissues, and smooth muscle cells are differentiating and organizing in
supporting arteries. However, how semilunar valves and great arteries remodel in response to TOF-induced
abnormal hemodynamic loads during fetal stages remains unknown.
To address this knowledge gap, this project will use a chick embryonic model of TOF that reproduces the
characteristic heart morphologies and flow patterns found in human fetuses with TOF. Avian embryos are
amenable to in vivo imaging and allow tightly controlled longitudinal studies in ovo. Moreover, valve leaflets in
human and chick exhibit the same characteristic layers, which similarly arrange in response to blood flow cues
during fetal development in human and pre-hatching in chick. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is
that before birth abnormal blood flow in TOF leads to aberrant, disorganized deposition of collagen and elastin
fibers in semilunar valve leaflets, and abnormal smooth muscle cell localization in supporting great artery
tissues. Three aims are proposed: 1) Determine characteristic blood flow patterns in fetal hearts with TOF
using advanced in vivo imaging and computational modeling; 2) Assess abnormal tissue remodeling
of semilunar valves and great arteries in TOF through a combination of advanced multiscale
microscopy; 3) Develop predictive models of flow-induced semilunar valve remodeling in TOF.
Through a novel combination of multiscale imaging and computational modeling, this project will elucidate how
TOF-induced abnormal blood flow leads to (and exacerbates) semilunar valve and great artery tissue
anomalies. In the future, findings from this project will improve fetal diagnosis and prediction of prenatal
pathological valve remodeling, enabling better decisions of when and how to intervene to avoid or even
reverse pathological valve remodeling, and will inform valve regeneration efforts."
10893557,"The giant Drosophila protocadherins Fat and Dachsous (Ds) form a heterophilic, bidirectional signaling pair
that regulates proliferation via the growth-inhibiting Hippo pathway, and planar cell polarity (PCP) both through
and independently of the “core” PCP pathway. These functions are shared by their mammalian homologs, and
human mutations in Fat and Ds homologs cause the neurological and multisystem defects of Hennekam and
Van Maldergem syndromes. Despite its importance, only a little is known about how binding between Fat and
Ds change cell behavior, and thus how it regulates development and pathology.
Fat, Ds and the effectors of the Hippo and PCP pathways are concentrated in the subapical domain of
epithelial cells, and the intracellular domain (ICD) of Fat has strong effects on the subapical levels of two
critical proteins. The first is the scaffolding myosin Dachs, which binds and inhibits Warts (Lats1/2), the final
effector kinase in the Hippo pathway, and which regulates Sple in the core PCP pathway. The second is the
FERM scaffolding protein Expanded, which stimulates Warts activity.
Using a combination of protein-binding screens, biochemistry and molecular genetics, we established a link
from the Fat ICD to Dachs and Expanded levels and localization via the DHHC palmitoyltransferase
Approximated and one of its targets, the SH3 domain protein Dlish. However, Approximated must have
additional targets in the pathway, and the details of Approximated and Dlish regulation are poorly understood.
In this proposal we outline plans to identify characterize new Approximated targets, including Expanded itself,
and further plans to analyze the regulation of Approximated activity and target recognition, first through
modification of Approximated and its targets, and second through the previously uncharacterized GOLGA7-like
adapter protein CG5447.
Fat and Ds are also remarkable in their ability to polarize cells along the epithelial plane via their own cell-by-
cell polarization to opposite cell faces. We have initiated studies on the intracellular control and amplification of
Fat/Ds polarization. We explore previously unsuspected roles for intracellular pathway components in the
regulation of Fat and Ds levels and polarization, including the casein kinse 1 Dco, the ubiquitin ligase Slimb,
the myosin Dachs, and the intracellular domain of Fat itself."

The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the skills required to achieve my career goal of becoming an
independent investigator with a research focus on the role of blood coagulation factors in cell signaling during
tissue injury and inflammation. Accordingly, I have developed a Research Plan that will build a strong foundation
for conducting research across disciplines in hepatology, toxicology, and thrombosis and hemostasis. Strong
clinical and experimental evidence suggests that the blood coagulation cascade plays a pathologic role in the
progression of hepatic fibrosis, i.e., “scarring” of the chronically injured liver. One hypothesis linking coagulation
activity to hepatic fibrosis proposes that the coagulation protease thrombin drives hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)
to a collagen-expressing myofibroblast phenotype by activating its primary receptor, protease-activated receptor-
1 (PAR-1). However, the precise mechanisms linking PAR-1 activation to the HSC pro-fibrotic phenotype are
unknown. My central hypothesis is that thrombin activation of PAR-1 drives HSCs to a pro-fibrotic phenotype by
amplifying the signaling functions of tissue factor (TF), the transmembrane receptor for coagulation factor VIIa
(FVIIa). To test this hypothesis, I propose three Specific Aims. First, I will determine the mechanisms whereby
PAR-1 activation drives a pro-fibrotic phenotype in hepatic stellate cells. I hypothesize that PAR-1 activation
amplifies the HSC pro-fibrotic phenotype through induction of TF:FVIIa signaling. The role of TF:FVIIa signaling
in PAR-1-mediated HSC activation will be determined using a combination of in vitro approaches including
exogenous FVIIa treatment and HSCs lacking TF or PAR-2 (i.e., the receptor mediating TF:FVIIa signaling). The
role of HSC TF in experimental hepatic fibrosis will be determined using novel mice with HSC-specific TF
deficiency. Next, I will determine the role of thrombin:PAR-1 signaling in experimental hepatic fibrosis. The
precise role of thrombin-mediated PAR-1 activation in hepatic fibrosis has never been investigated in vivo
because PAR-1 can be cleaved by multiple proteases. I hypothesize that activation of PAR-1 by thrombin drives
experimental hepatic fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, I will use a combination of strategies including mice
expressing ~10% of normal prothrombin levels and novel mutant mice expressing PAR-1 that is selectively
insensitive to cleavage at specific residues by thrombin or by other agonist proteases. Finally, I will identify the
mechanisms driving coagulation activation in the injured liver. I hypothesize that coagulation activation in
experimental CCl4-induced chronic liver injury is driven by the intrinsic coagulation pathway. I will use
complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches to determine the precise role of the extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways of coagulation cascade activation in hepatic fibrosis driven by experimental chronic liver injury. The
proposed studies will allow me to carve out a unique research niche investigating the cell signaling functions of
blood coagulation factors, and would ultimately drive development of novel therapeutics which target local
coagulation-mediated cell signaling events to reduce hepatic fibrosis with minimal impact on normal hemostasis."
10724248,"The goal of my current work is to examine how ethanol exposure results in impaired function of the Golgi
apparatus. The Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body or Golgi complex) packages proteins into membrane
bound vesicles inside the cell before the vesicles are sent to their destination. As such, this organelle resides at
the intersection of the secretory, lysosomal, and endocytic pathways; it is known to be of particular importance
in processing proteins for secretion. Previous work from our laboratory has identified multiple defects in
endocytosis, protein trafficking, and secretion, after alcohol administration, but we have not until now, examined
a role for altered Golgi function in these processes. Because the incidence of alcoholic liver disease is greater
in the Veteran population and more than half of all medical admissions in VA Medical Centers across the country
are linked to alcohol abuse, we are focusing efforts towards the identification of potential targets to intervene
during the progressive injury which occurs after chronic alcohol administration, and perhaps the Golgi will prove
to be such a target. Of central importance to our study is the role of a small GTPase, Rab3D, which is involved
in exocytosis, secretion and vesicle trafficking. We have shown that Rab3D protein content was significantly
decreased after alcohol administration, and recently we have obtained exciting new preliminary data that ethanol-
impaired Rab3D function plays an important role in Golgi disorganization and fragmentation. The studies
proposed in this application will extend our ongoing investigation of how ethanol alters hepatocyte biology,
specifically in protein processing, to an examination of its role in transport through the Golgi. We provide a
concept as to how alcohol-induced remodeling of Golgi morphology is a significant impairment of post-Golgi
trafficking, and this leads to utilization of trans-Golgi membranes for the formation of autophagosomes. For this
work, we present the following hypothesis: Ethanol exposure contributes to Golgi disorganization via its
fragmentation and autophagy-mediated Golgi membrane lysis, leading to impaired endocytic and
exocytic protein trafficking. Altered distribution and function of the small GTPase Rab3D plays a critical
role in these alterations. To examine our hypothesis, we have proposed three specific aims; in Aim 1 we will
characterize the distribution of Rab3D in vitro and in vivo in liver cells before and after EtOH administration.
Studies proposed for Aim 2 will establish a role for Rab3D in the transport of physiologically relevant hepatic
proteins. These studies will be followed by experiments proposed for Aim 3 where we will determine if EtOH-
induced Golgi disorganization and fragmentation contribute to autophagosome formation and how altered Rab3D
function affects hepatocyte autophagy. Altogether, successful completion of these aims will characterize the
effect of EtOH on Golgi disorganization, and establish a role for altered Rab3D during this process. We will be
able to correlate mechanisms of alcohol-mediated liver cell trafficking impairments with impaired Golgi function
and provide key information that could lead to therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing or eliminating liver injury.
In this work, I am joined by three outstanding co-investigators (Drs. Petrosyan, Thomes and Rasineni), the latter
two are young investigators based at the Omaha VA. I also have collaborative effort with multiple VA
investigators, as outlined in my research plan, and these collaborations have been highly productive. The
exploration of how alcohol impairs function of important organelles such as the Golgi and lipid droplets will
provide new avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease. Our contribution is significant since this is a critical step to provide translational knowledge for the
development of therapies for fatty liver disease. Additionally, our findings will also have broader implications for
other hepatic diseases characterized by hepatic injury. With the expertise and collaborations available to my
group, we anticipate that we will be successful in these studies and will be able to contribute to improved
healthcare for Veteran patients by the identification of mechanisms involved in the alcoholic liver injury."
10724249,"Over 200,000 US Veterans are suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this ﬁgure is expected to increase
dramatically in the next few decades due to a higher prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are risk factors of AD among soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan
wars. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most prevalent genetic risk factor for AD, representing 60%
of AD subjects in the general population. The apoE protein is a functional component of plasma involved in the
transport of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) into the brain which plays a key role in neurotransmission,
membrane repair and cell signaling. Recent investigations have identiﬁed loss of DHA within
phosphatidylcholine (PC) in both the brain and blood of AD patients. Our previous work shows that pattern of
DHA alterations seen in ε4 carriers with preclinical AD is similar to those seen in ε4 carriers with TBI or TBI
+PTSD. While the brain is able to synthesize most lipids, DHA has to be acquired from the periphery since its
de novo synthesis is insufﬁcient to meet the high demand in the brain. Studies show that among ε4 carriers,
transport of DHA to the brain is reduced compared to non-ε4 carriers, contributing to the pro-inﬂammatory and
pro-amyloidogenic brain environment that is conducive to the development of AD. As such, increasing DHA
transport into the brain could be important for preventing or treating AD among ε4 carriers who are at an
exceptionally higher risk for developing AD and don't respond well to experimental AD treatments. Lyso-PC
(LPC)-DHA is specially transported to the brain through a specialized transporter major facilitator superfamily
domain containing 2A (mfsd2a) within the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). We have observed that the expression of
mfds2a is reduced in the cerebrovasculature of ε4 carriers compared to non-ε4 carriers, in humans and in a
mouse model of AD with human APOE4 gene (E4FAD). We observed that LPC-DHA levels are reduced in the
brain parenchyma of ε4 AD patients compared to ε4 controls and non-ε4 AD patients and in E4FAD compared
to E3FAD mice. We also observed an increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression in ε4 AD
patients and in E4FAD mice. We hypothesize that MMP9 activity is elevated in the presence of ε4 which leads
to alterations of the cerebrovasculature, including reduced mfsd2a levels. This results in insufﬁcient brain entry
of LPC-DHA, inﬂammation, and exacerbated AD pathology. To address this problem, we will characterize DHA
containing PC and LPC species within the brains of AD and control subjects stratiﬁed by different APOE
genotypes and quantify corresponding changes in mfsd2a expression. Using EFAD mice, we will generate
temporal proﬁles of PC and LPC-DHA changes and corresponding mfsd2a reduction and its relationship with
AD pathology. Moreover, we will use both in vitro and in vivo approaches to determine whether the presence
of the apoE4 isoform in the absence of mfsd2a leads to a reduction of LPC-DHA and free DHA transport into
the brain and if boosting mfsd2a expression counteracts these effects. We will delve deeper into the
fundamental role of MMP9 in the transport of lipids into the brain and evaluate the impact of MMP9-directed
therapies on mfsd2a expression and LPC-DHA brain entry in AD. To this point, we have preliminary data
indicating that increasing mfsd2a in the brain cerebrovasculature increases brain LPC-DHA levels and reduces
inﬂammation in older E4FAD mice with well-established AD pathology. We ﬁnd these observations to be
extremely compelling as AD therapies have consistently failed in patients with 1) existing AD and 2) those
carrying the ε4 allele. These preliminary ﬁndings shows promise in treating both of these notoriously resistant
populations. Overall, these studies will elucidate mechanisms by which MMP9-mediated loss of mfsd2a causes
reduced uptake of DHA in the brain and, additionally, will explore therapeutic avenues to increase LPC-DHA
transport into the brain to prevent and treat AD, particularly in ε4 carriers."
10850797,"Abstract. After Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, 5-10% of people develop clinically evident
tuberculosis (TB), most within two years. This leads to 10 million new cases of TB and 1.5 million deaths each
year. Why immunity fails and permits recrudescence in people that initially control Mtb is unknown. Risk factors
include diabetes, malnutrition, alcoholism, cancer, and smoking, all which cause metabolic stress. Our long-term
goal is to understand the drivers of immune failure and identify protective mechanisms of immunity. A major
knowledge gap is how various metabolic insults affect cellular immunity in the infected lung. Our over-arching
hypothesis is that that during TB, metabolic stressors such as granuloma hypoxia contribute to T cell dysfunction,
degrade immunity, and impair Mtb containment. We and others find that T cells from patients with pulmonary TB
and chronically Mtb-infected mice are dysfunctional. Dysfunctional CD8 T cells (e.g., exhausted CD8 T cells)
have been intensively studied because of their role in tumor immunity. In contrast, far less is known about CD4
T cell dysfunction. We will investigate both CD4 and CD8 T cells and focus on CD4 T cells as they are crucial
for immunity to Mtb. We will use the murine TB model to investigate how metabolic stress affects T cell function
and contributes to TB pathogenesis. An important component of our strategy is to compare T cells from
susceptible mice that develop hypoxic granulomas with T cells from resistant mouse strains. The first aim is to
“Determine the relationship between metabolic perturbation and T cell dysfunction.” A high-resolution map of T
cell responses to Mtb in susceptible and resistant mice will be assembled after performing scRNASeq, TCRseq,
conventional flow cytometry and MetFlow (to assess cell metabolism). We will determine whether dysfunctional
T cells differ in their control of Mtb in vitro and in vivo. Secondly, we will “Determine how hypoxia affects T cell
immunity against Mtb.” Using hypoxia fate reporter mice, we will study how hypoxia affects T cell function in vivo.
These studies will be coupled with mechanistic studies using hypoxic culture conditions in vitro. We will establish
how hypoxia, metabolic stress, and T cell function are related, and whether hypoxia is detrimental to protective
T cell responses during TB. Finally, Aim 3 will “Assess how metabolic interventions alter T cell function and TB
outcome.” We predict that drugs that correct underlying metabolic perturbations can improve T cell function and
enhance control of Mtb infection. Using the hypoxic mouse models, proof-of-principle experiments will be done
to determine how drugs that affect neovascularization, target metabolism, or protect mitochondria, affect Mtb
containment in vivo. Our studies will determine how hypoxia and metabolic stress affect immunity to Mtb and
provide insight into why CD4 immunity fails. As T cells are essential in containing Mtb infection, we hypothesize
that interventions to limit T cell dysfunction or improve their function will augment Mtb containment. Metabolic
reprogramming of T cells in the tumor microenvironment is on the horizon. Our hypothesis embraces the idea
that metabolic therapeutics could prevent or reverse T cell dysfunction and improve TB outcome."
10884329,"During the last 2.5 decades, I have led clinical efforts to develop novel NK cell immunotherapy strategies to treat
cancer by advancing lab-based discoveries in the areas of natural killer (NK) cell and IL-15 biology. This work
has been supported by a continuously funded and recently renewed NCI P01 (CA111412) grant, now in its 21st
year of funding (through 2026). This P01 will serve as the clinical output for the translational work proposed in
this R35 application. An R35 award will allow me to further pivot my research program to focus on solid tumors.
I started a long-standing NK Cell Program at the University of Minnesota that now includes a team of basic and
translational scientists interested in NK cell immunotherapy. My research group has found that exposure to
cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces a population of NK cells with potent immune and anti-tumor function that are
marked by the expression of the NKG2C activating receptor that recognizes HLA-E, which is overexpressed on
many solid tumor cancers. Our highest impact research during the past 5 years is based on an induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived NK cell platform designed with attributes of naturally occurring CMV-induced
adaptive NK cells. This iPSC platform allows an unlimited number of iPSC gene edits to be performed at the
clonal level for mechanistic studies that will be translated into clinical trials. I have used my expertise in NK cell
development to help develop methods for directed differentiation of iPSCs to the NK cell lineage (termed iNK) at
clinical scale to generate fully functional NK cells for immunotherapy. These iNK cells will be multiplex engineered
to enhance tumor-specific activity and persistence in a hostile “cold” tumor environment. My team, who pioneered
adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells in 2005, has the most experience worldwide, having infused >400
haploidentical NK cell products to treat patients with cancer. We have now made a complete transition away
from individual donor blood cell products because of their variability, barriers to gene editing, high cost, and
difficulty exporting to the cancer community. The overarching goal of this R35 OIA is to develop novel
strategies to specifically target solid tumor malignancies by testing new iPSC edits that facilitate homing and
migration, overcome hypoxia, and promote survival after adoptive transfer in patients with solid tumor
malignancies. To enhance the specificity and anti-tumoral activity of our iNK cells, we have developed a camelid
nanobody specific for B7-H3 that serves as the engager of a novel chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). We have
chosen to further study the anti-tumor function of these new CAR iNK cells against two solid tumors (glioblastoma
and prostate cancer) that demonstrate oncogenic dependence on the expression of B7-H3. B7-H3 is not
expressed at the protein level in normal tissues. We will also compare these CAR iNK cells using the same CAR
edited into an iPSC-derived T cell (termed iT). The impact of these investigations is to develop novel off-the-
shelf immune cell therapies with potential to change standards of cancer care."

Despite the overall reduced responsiveness to external stimuli during sleep, incoming sounds are processed
by a highly active and broadly projecting auditory system. Moreover, not only the acoustic aspects of sounds
are processed during sleep but also their associated meaning, as evidenced by a higher likelihood of
awakening from novel and meaningful sounds as compared to familiar and meaningless sounds. These and
other findings suggest that there is ongoing semantic neural processing during sleep, yet the underlying brain
circuits and neurophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Sound salience processing during
sleep enables rapid arousal when a behavioral response is appropriate, such as in the presence of danger or
when an infant is in need. However, as millions of people in the US and worldwide live in noisy urban
environments, in which they are exposed to household, traffic and other neighborhood sounds during sleep,
ongoing processing of sounds during sleep may come at a cost. During sleep in the absence of incoming
sounds, brain circuits engage in internally generated neural activity patterns that underlie memory
consolidation–the transformation of temporary and labile memory traces into long-term memories. A potential
interaction between sound processing and memory processes during sleep has been proposed by recent
epidemiological studies which link exposure to nighttime noise and memory impairments. Moreover, we have
recently discovered that acute exposure to non-awakening sounds during sleep impairs subsequent memory
retention in rodents. However, the acoustic properties of sounds impairing memory consolidation, the
consequences of chronic exposure to sounds during sleep on memory capacities and the neural interactions
between online sound processing with offline neurophysiological signatures of memory consolidation are
largely unknown.
We will fill these knowledge gaps using electrophysiological and optical recordings from multiple brain regions,
closed-loop sound manipulations and light-activated modulation of neural activity in freely behaving and
naturally sleeping mice. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of key brain regions in sound salience processing
during wakefulness–the auditory cortex and ventral tegmental area–in processing of sound salience during
sleep. In Aim 2, we will determine the acoustic properties of sounds that impair memory processes and the
consequences of chronic sound exposure during sleep on memory capacities. In Aim 3, we will determine the
acute and chronic consequences of sound processing during sleep on circuit-level neurophysiological
mechanisms of memory consolidation. Together, these experiments will provide a mechanistic understanding
of the neuronal substrates underlying sound processing during sleep and their mnemonic consequences."

Current emergency department (ED) triage systems across the U.S. lead to mis-triage in up to one third of
patient encounters, worsening ED crowding and contributing to delays and disparities in care. Early studies
showed triage prediction models outperformed the subjective triage systems used in most EDs by prioritizing
sicker patients, although significant gaps remain. Early models did not: 1) predict outcomes other than hospital
admission, even though 80-90% of ED visits do not result in hospital admission; 2) include pediatric patients,
even though pediatric patients contribute up to 25% of visits; 3) consider health equity in design or evaluation
of prediction models; or 4) study impacts on key patient safety and quality measures, such as timeliness of
care. Our proposal addresses these unmet needs and responds to two AHRQ Special Emphasis Notices, HS-
21-014 (Health Services Research to Advance Health Equity) and HS-22-004 (Research on Digital Healthcare
Safety). Our study team has completed significant preliminary analyses, including: 1) study cohort build of over
6 million ED encounters across the 21 EDs in our health system; 2) assessment of significant limitations of
triage in study setting; and 3) development of machine-learning models to predict patient acuity and resource
needs at triage. In Aim 1, we will refine triage models that predict: 1) critical illness; 2) hospital admission; and
3) fast-track eligibility (<2 resources needed, no hospital admission or critical outcomes). We will measure
algorithm biases and explore strategies to improve equity in triage model predictions. In Aim 2, we will map
probability thresholds for each outcome into clinically relevant triage category recommendations. We will use a
human factors framework and significant stakeholder engagement to design, build, and evaluate clinician-
facing triage clinical decision support (CDS). Lastly, we will build the CDS into our electronic health record to
efficiently display personalized risk predictions for each outcome as part of standard triage workflows. In Aim 3,
we will assess the impact of the CDS in real time in a pragmatic, step-wedged cluster randomized trial across
21 hospital-based EDs and one free-standing ED. Our primary outcomes will be: 1) timeliness of care for
critically ill patients; 2) appropriate early identification of fast-track eligible patients; and 3) ED length of stay. In
addition, to test the equity-driven calibrations in our models, we will assess for bias by race, gender, and
socioeconomic status among primary outcomes. Our secondary outcomes will be CDS reach, adoption, and
implementation. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to demonstrate the extent to
which a novel point-of-care digital technology that uses advanced predictive analytics can lead to safer, higher
quality, and more equitable care."

preferred treatment modality for end-stage kidney disease. While late allograft failure has a multifactorial
etiology, one of the largest contributors is the development of donor specific HLA antibodies (dnDSA), leading
to allograft loss at a median 3-5 years post detection of antibodies. Donor specific HLA antibodies develop
against short amino acid sequences within the HLA antigen. Each HLA antigen has multiple epitopes that can
interact with the recipient immune system, and antibody-verified epitopes are termed “eplets”. Mismatched
epitopes can be identified and enumerated using various molecular mismatch software packages. However,
not all epitopes are equally likely to induce an antibody response in the recipient, as specific “high-risk” eplet
mismatches were found to be disproportionally associated with dnDSA formation. Avoidance of high-risk
mismatches between donor and recipient at the time of organ allocation is one way to improve long-term
allograft survival because it would reduce the number of potential dnDSA targets.
 Variable immunogenicity is an accepted concept however details about which mismatches are high risk
has not been well established. I propose to establish a multi-site pediatric kidney transplant (KT) cohort with full
HLA genotyping on recipients and donors to perform such an analysis. This will inform the development of an
adaptive allocation model, that can better account for the entangled and dynamic nature of allocation systems.
The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) has mandated the development of a new allocation
model, to develop a composite allocation scoring system that can account for dynamic changes in multiple
recipient and donor characteristics. There is insufficient data to inform such a model on how to handle HLA
mismatch on an epitope-level. My work with the multi-site cohort will inform how to best inform incorporate
molecular mismatch analysis and high-resolution tissue typing data into an adaptive allocation model.
 My career goal is to become an independent clinical researcher focused on improving outcomes for KT
recipients by studying the adaptive and humoral immune response to the allograft and conducting clinical trials
to test interventions to reduce the burden of disease. By completion of the proposed research and didactic
training at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, I will obtain a PhD in Clinical Research Methodology
and develop a unique skillset that will allow me to establish an independent research career in transplant
immunology. Specifically, I will gain expertise in multi-site study design and execution, large data management
and analysis, advanced computational modeling, and application of immunogenetics to clinical practice."
10739185,"The overall goal of this K01 proposal is to examine cognitive, behavioral, and brain-based markers of self-
regulation as predictors of cannabis and alcohol co-use in adolescence. Between 2-6% of early adolescents
aged 13-14 years report cannabis and alcohol co-use, and co-use is associated with more adverse outcomes
(e.g., engaging in high-risk behaviors) compared to single-drug use. Problems with self-regulation have been
linked to alcohol and cannabis use individually, but less is known about self-regulatory vulnerabilities in the
context of future adolescent cannabis and alcohol co-use. To address this gap, Dr. Goncalves proposes to study
two drivers of reduced self-regulation: lower executive functioning, and high impulsivity, prior to the onset of
alcohol and substance use in two extensive population studies (1- Collaborative Study on the Genetics of
Alcoholism [COGA], 2- the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development [ABCD]) and through collecting pilot data
using an ongoing multigeneration family study (MFS). This proposal will evaluate self-regulation markers (using
cognitive tasks, behavioral scales, and structural neuroimaging measures) prior to the onset of use in late
childhood and adolescence. Aim 1 will investigate this question using the COGA study, in which self-regulation
was assessed at ages 12-16, cannabis and alcohol use at ages 16-20, and cannabis/alcohol use disorders at
ages 20-24. Aim 2 will test this question in the ABCD study, where self-regulation (i.e., cognitive tasks and
cortical thickness) was assessed at ages 9-10 years, and cannabis and alcohol use and co-use starting at ages
13-14 years. Aim 3 will test this question in MFS, where self-regulation was previously assessed at ages 6-12
years, and Dr Goncalves will collect data on use, co-use and risk perception associated with cannabis and
alcohol co-use at 12-18 years. This multi-study proposal will allow testing of how impairments in self-regulation
and abnormalities in frontal cortical thickness (prior to any substance use) are associated with future cannabis
and alcohol use and co-use and their associated disorders. These results will inform an R01 application, focusing
on examining risk and resilience factors for cannabis and alcohol co-use and co-occurring cannabis and alcohol
use disorders when the ABCD participants are ages 17-18. Finally, findings of the proposed K01 project will
inform the development of an R21 application focused on a pilot intervention for polysubstance in adolescents.
In addition to answering the above research questions, this project will serve as a training vehicle for Dr.
Goncalves, providing her advanced training in self-regulation development, frontal cortical thickness
development in late childhood and adolescence, and development and operationalization of pilot data collection
on an adolescent sample. The training plan builds on the candidate's prior clinical experience, and capitalizes
on a stellar mentorship team and research environment to foster Dr. Goncalves' development. This K01 proposal
will fulfill Dr. Goncalves' training needs, enable her transition to being an independent Latina researcher, and
ensure that she becomes a leading expert in adolescent neurocognitive development and polysubstance use."
10873875,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Tanya Halliday, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health
& Kinesiology in the College of Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Halliday is establishing herself as an
emerging leader in obesity research, specifically in developing efficacious weight loss maintenance interventions.
This K01 award will provide Dr. Halliday the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) Strengthen
skills in qualitative research and mixed methods approaches; 2) Develop expertise in complex clinical trial
design, particularly adaptive interventions and SMART designs with longitudinal follow-up; and 3) Develop
advanced research leadership and management skills.
To achieve these goals, Dr. Halliday has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a two Co-Primary Mentors.
Dr. Molly Conroy, a physician-scientist experienced in performing large-scale health behavior RCTs, including
studies of weight loss maintenance, and Dr. Julie Fritz, clinical and translational scientist with expertise in utilizing
adaptive interventions, a type of study design which will be developed and tested to prevent weight regain in the
proposed K01, and SMART designs. Dr. Halliday will also be mentored in qualitative research methods and
analysis by Dr. Susan Zickmund, with Dr. Jincheng Shen serving as an advisor for biostatics for adaptive design
trials.
The lack of successful long-term weight loss interventions is the greatest challenge for obesity management.
Based on recent evidence, and her own preliminary data, Dr. Halliday’s central hypothesis is that an adaptive
intervention involving individually tailored re-engagement with professional support will be feasible and able to
prevent weight regain following intentional weight loss. She will test this hypothesis by developing and pilot
testing and 6-month adaptive re-engagement intervention in adults whom have recently lost a significant (≥7%)
amount of weight with lifestyle (diet/exercise) interventions. By pursuing the following specific aims, the applicant
will test her hypothesis and gather data for a clinical trial to 1) Qualitatively explore weight regain triggers for
weight-reduced adults as well as preferred aspects of an evidence-based adaptive re-engagement intervention;
2) Develop an adaptive intervention to re-engage patients at times they are at risk of weight-regain; and 3)
Determine the feasibility of an adaptive re-engagement intervention to prevent weight regain.
The proposed research is significant because weight loss interventions are unsuccessful long-term and new
approaches to prevent weight regain are needed. The proposed research is innovative because adaptive re-
engagement trials have not been evaluated as a weight loss maintenance approach; adaptive interventions are
typically not developed with rigorous preliminary work like that proposed in this project; and outcome measures
will be evaluated after 6-months of follow-up to determine the longitudinal feasibility of the adaptive intervention
to prevent weight regain."
10890157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic
cancers. However, for solid tumors, CAR T cells face challenges including intratumor heterogeneity, dynamic
expression of target receptors, and often the inability for T cells to traffic to tumors to mediate the desired
antitumor effect. In contrast to the lack of T cell infiltrates, many solid tumors are abundant in immune
suppressive myeloid cells including macrophages. Therefore, converting these immune suppressive cells into
tumoricidal phenotype represents a promising strategy for cell-based therapy. There are now strong interest in
generating CAR macrophages in which autologous macrophages are transduced with CAR delivered by viral
vectors ex vivo to enhance their phagocytosis, antigen presentation and cytokine producing capabilities
following re-infusion. However, ex vivo preparation of CAR macrophages is complex, time consuming, and due
to the non-dividing nature of macrophages, is often inefficient. With the recent advances in mRNA-based
therapeutics, it is now possible to reprogram specific immune cell populations in vivo, thus eliminating the
complex ex vivo production of autologous CAR cells. Our present proposal aims to propose an innovative
strategy of generating CAR macrophages in vivo using mRNA-loaded exosomes to treat HER2 receptor
positive breast cancer. This will be the first study to evaluate the feasibility of producing CAR macrophages in
vivo using mRNA delivery platforms and assessing the antitumor efficacy of CAR macrophages for cancer
immunotherapy. We hypothesize that our strategy represents a revolutionary way to produce CAR
macrophages in vivo using CAR mRNA-loaded exosome and offers a promising new approach for cell therapy
against solid tumors. Our previous study showed that we can efficiently produce mRNA-loaded exosomes to
restore protein expression in solid tumors. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments showed that the
exosomes loaded with HER2 CAR mRNA can produce CAR macrophages in vivo with enhanced effector
functions. Our current study will test our overall hypothesis by using the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will evaluate the dynamics and toxicity of CAR macrophage production in vivo using CAR mRNA exosomes. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate transcriptomic and functional profiles of in vivo generated CAR macrophages, Finally,
in Aim 3, we will assess the antitumor effect of in vivo generated CAR macrophages against both murine and
human HER2 expressing breast cancer. If successful, our proposed research can overcome a major technical
hurdle that is currently facing cell therapy. The mRNA exosome platform could potentially be expanded to other
CAR constructs and greatly expand the potential utility of cell therapy for breast and other solid cancers."
10884420,"Breast cancer remains a major killer of women due to the ineffectiveness of current drugs against
metastatic and drug-resistant cancers. Additionally, African American (AA) women suffer
disproportionately from breast cancer mortality in part because they develop the aggressive Triple-
Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype more frequently than other ethnic groups. Thus, agents
effective against drug-resistant and metastatic cancers and TNBCs may improve the survival of
breast cancer patients. These aggressive cancers evade cell death through a variety of mechanisms
including overactivation of the pro-survival HER-family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs),
including EGFR/HER1, HER2, and HER3 (HER1-3), and inactivation of pro-apoptotic signaling.
Tumors expressing HER1-3 are difficult to treat due to the partial redundancy among these receptors,
their oncogenic signaling as heterodimers, and their ability to aberrantly heterodimerize with non-HER
RTKs such as MET and IGF1R. Thus, resistance to current HER-targeted agents is a significant
clinical problem. Defective cancer cell apoptosis can result from inactivation of the TNF Receptor
Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL)/Death Receptor 4/5 (DR4/5) pathway, which selectively kills
cancer cells, while not affecting normal cells. Tumor resistance to TRAIL and other DR4/5 agonists
results primarily from poor pharmacological properties of the agonists and the ability of cancer cells to
downregulate DR4/5. Consequently, agents that could inactivate the EGFR/HER2/HER3 signaling
axis and upregulate and activate DR4/5 independently of the TRAIL ligand may be efficacious against
breast cancers unresponsive to current medicines. Disulfide bond Disrupting Agents (DDAs) are a
new class of anti-cancer agents that induce regression of primary tumors and metastatic lesions of
drug-resistant patient-derived tumors in animal models. In addition to the structural uniqueness of
DDAs, recent studies indicate that DDAs are the first identified active site inhibitors of the Protein
Disulfide Isomerases (PDIs) ERp44 and AGR2. Further, DDA inhibition of the PDIs ERp44, AGR2,
and PDIA1 alters the disulfide bonding of HER1-3 and DR4/5, resulting in HER1-3 downregulation,
DR5 upregulation, and disulfide bond-mediated oligomerization and activation of DR4/5. The
objective of the current project is to move DDAs toward clinical trials. The two Specific Aims proposed
to achieve this objective are to 1) optimize DDA pharmacological properties and dosing for future
IND-enabling studies, and 2) validate biomarkers to predict tumor sensitivity to DDAs and to monitor
target engagement, and thoroughly evaluate any adverse effects of DDAs on normal tissues or
animal health. Based on their unique mechanisms of action and preclinical efficacy, we expect DDAs
to benefit breast cancer patients with treatment-refractory breast cancers."

This project aims to advance early screening procedures for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
in young children with Down syndrome (DS). Co-occurring ASD is a lifelong condition that
impacts quality of life, adaptation, and cost of care for individuals with DS. A lack of
systematic research on early development in young children with DS has significantly
hindered efforts to identify those at heightened risk for ASD. The current lack of early
detection means that children with DS+ASD do not benefit from developmentally informed,
anticipatory early interventions that are available to the general population of young children
with ASD. This project will identify markers of ASD risk in DS with an examination of two
areas: (1) developmental presentation during early childhood in the areas of cognition,
communication, motor skills, adaptive behavior, and other relevant developmental domains,
and (2) the presence of candidate biomedical risk conditions including premature birth and
low birth weight, infantile spasms (West syndrome), congenital heart defects, sleep
dysregulation, and gastrointestinal conditions. We will characterize developmental profiles,
biomedical conditions, and ASD symptom presentation comprehensively in a cohort of 225
young children with DS across three data waves (Wave 1: 18-21 months; Wave 2: 30-33
months; Wave 3: 42-45 months). We will then model the relationship between developmental
and biomedical factors at Waves 1 and 2 and ASD presentation at Wave 3 via mixture
modeling to identify the strongest early predictors of later ASD outcomes. Based on these
analyses, we will generate recommendations for ASD screening protocols for children with
DS ages 18 to 45 months. Findings from this study will directly address the NIH INCLUDE
objective of improving health and well-being for people with DS."

Over 50% of long-term survivors of the Fontan operation with single ventricle congenital heart disease develop
heart failure, for which standard therapies (ACE inhibitors, β-blockers) are largely ineffective. Thus, a major
challenge in treating Fontan heart/circulation failure is in understanding its unique mechanisms that differentiate
it from the more common acute ischemia-related heart failure and identifying new therapeutic targets. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to develop new therapeutic targets to preserve heart function, and to identify
biomarkers to detect heart/circulation failure earlier in the clinical course of patients with a Fontan circulation.
We have previously identified chronic oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial injury as a major mechanism in
Fontan failure. We hypothesize that oxidative stress induces cardiomyocytes to release damaged mitochondria
that impair endothelial function in both the heart (local) and peripheral vasculature (plasma) in patients with
Fontan failure. We examine this general question through the lens of cell-cell communication in the
cardiovascular system. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the role of chronic non-ischemic oxidative stress in causing
mitochondrial dysfunction in Fontan failure. We will use myocardial tissue to assess lipid peroxidation-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction, correlate mitochondrial dysfunction with severity of clinical illness and how damaged
mitochondria can be packaged and transported in extracellular vesicles to mediate cell-cell communication. In
Aim 2, we will investigate whether lipid peroxidation-induced mitochondrial injury impairs cardiac vascular
function. We will show that cardiac vascular dysfunction is a critical component of Fontan failure which may serve
as a novel therapeutic target. We will assess endothelial mitochondrial dynamics in myocardial tissue from
children with Fontan failure, assess cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell-cell communication via extracellular
vesicles and phenotype the cardiac microvascular tree to assess for lipid peroxidation and cell death. In Aim 3,
we will determine circulating biomarkers to monitor clinical status in children with and without Fontan failure and
compare to control. We will show that circulating extracellular vesicles carrying oxidatively damaged
mitochondria cause peripheral vascular endothelial dysfunction, determining the role of extracellular vesicles in
initiating metabolic reprogramming, both locally and in distant organs. Using innovative approaches, including
3D human tissue imaging and high throughput quantitative proteomics, in a large cohort of patients with a Fontan
circulation, we will test our hypothesis and examine the effectiveness of new mitochondrial-targeted therapies,
including repurposing the FDA-approved small molecule elamipretide to target lipid peroxidation. Through better
understanding of the unique mechanisms of Fontan failure, our team of clinicians and experts in mitochondrial
and vascular biology are poised to develop new strategies for preventing and treating cellular energetic failure
and vascular dysfunction."
10933558,"Single-cell genomics technology has advanced at a blistering pace. The throughput of single-cell transcriptome
sequencing has increased by four orders of magnitude in the past five years alone, enabling our group and
others to catalog all of the cell types in a whole embryo within a single experiment. In parallel, assays for
diverse aspects of the epigenome, including chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation, and histone
modifications have been adapted to work in single cells and at scale. Furthermore, multiplexing techniques
have raised the prospect of using single-cell genomics not only to catalog cell types, but to comprehensively
study the effects of myriad perturbations of embryonic development, or to characterize the evolution of disease
pathogenesis at whole-animal scale and molecular resolution. In principle, single-cell genomics could serve as
an extraordinarily high-content means of phenotyping, but the volume and richness of datasets produced by
such experiments poses new, daunting computational and statistical challenges. A lack of software tools for
comparing specimens profiled as part of single-cell RNA-seq or ATAC-seq experiments constitutes a
critical gap in the field. This proposal aims to fill that gap with software tools that will allow users to
characterize how disease progression, genetic or chemical perturbations, or environmental effects alter the
proportions and molecular states of cells in complex tissues or whole embryos. In order to establish the
accuracy of our tools and the physiological relevance of their predictions, we will extensively validate their
output through analysis of existing and newly generated single-cell sequencing data using the very tractable
zebrafish embryonic development system. In our first Aim, we will develop software for detecting shifts within
cell populations across healthy and pathological molecular states. In our second Aim, we will develop software
for identifying genes that mediate or regulate cell-state transitions during development or disease
pathogenesis. In our third Aim, we will develop methods for defining how chromatin states at regulatory DNA
control transcriptional states. Upon completing these aims, we will have delivered new, widely applicable
software for analyzing single-cell genomics experiments. We will also have produced new datasets that will
serve both as a reference map for vertebrate embryogenesis and a platform for further development of tools for
genetic analysis by our group and others. Our experiments will also yield new insights as to how vertebrate
genomes encode developmental programs."
10884932,"ABSTRACT
Over the last decade we characterized and studied the properties of various tRNA derived
small RNAs (tsRNAs). In recent years, we have focused on one class commonly referred
to as 3’tsRNAs (derived from the 3’end of mature tRNAs) because they are the least well
studied but appear to play a role in tissue regeneration (e.g., liver regeneration) and
hyperproliferative states including cancer. Here we plan to establish the potential of targeting
the 3’tsRNAs for therapeutic purposes. Recently, we established that one specific RNA, the
22nt CAG-Leucine 3’tsRNA, which when down regulated by the addition of antisense
oligonucleotides in rapidly dividing but not quiescent cells inhibit ribosome biogenesis. Loss
of this specific tsRNA limits the translation (at the elongation step) of at least one ribosomal
protein mRNA. This results in a block in rRNA processing and rapid cellular apoptosis. In
contrast, the addition of a 3’tsRNA mimic increases cellular proliferation and can complement
the ribosome biogenesis defect in cells. We propose to further identify other 3’tsRNA-mRNA
interactions and establish their biologic and molecular function and develop gene therapy
and oligonucleotide antisense delivery technologies to pursue the therapeutic potential of
manipulating 3’tsRNAs in animals. Although the tsRNAs are expressed in many tissues, we
will focus these studies on the liver including liver cancer. This work will provide new
information related to 3’tsRNA function in gene regulation and cellular homeostasis in health
and disease states, as well as establish their potential therapeutic value by the proposed
preclinical human xenotransplant murine animal models. In the amended application, we
removed all the studies related to screening for improved LNPs outlined in previous specific
aim 3 as suggested by the reviewers."
10890870,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this project is to determine the general principles and causal mechanisms
underlying subcellular RNA localization, and the physiological implications during development and disease. In
particular, the subcellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) to cell protrusions is known to be required
for cell migration, but the mechanisms by which mRNA localization regulates protein function in this setting are
unclear. Many genes implicated in mRNA localization are expressed in neural crest cells, which are
a particularly migratory cell type that gives rise to much of the vertebrate head, as well as neurons,
melanocytes, and aggressive cancers including melanoma. As such, neural crest cells provide a rich
environment to uncover molecular mechanisms of mRNA localization in cell migration as well as the relevance
there of to mammalian physiology. In this project, I will use cultured melanoma cells to identify and
characterize trans-acting regulators of mRNA localization and elucidate the role of mRNA localization on
protein function. I will also use in vivo mouse models to catalog mRNA localization that occurs during neural
crest cell development and directly test the role of a well characterized localized mRNA, Kif1c, during
development and cancer onset and progression. As neural crest and cancer genetics fields rely heavily on
transcriptional studies, the mechanistic understanding of a post-transcriptional process as described here may
provide unique insight into the cause, diagnosis and treatment of craniofacial birth defects and melanoma
onset and progression.
My career goal is to run an academic research program analyzing the role and regulation of subcellular RNA
localization during embryogenesis, with special attention to neural crest cells and their derivatives. My ambition
is to have a lab that can determine molecular mechanisms at the single-molecule level and causally link those
processes to physiological outcomes in vivo. To this end, the proposed experiments and training plan are
designed to develop expertise in cutting-edge technologies such as TIRF microscopy, computational image
analysis, genetic engineering and in vivo disease assays. Training in these advanced techniques will be
directly supported by the resource-rich and collaborative environment at UT Southwestern, and especially
mentorship from Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, Dr. Ondine Cleaver, Dr. Khuloud Jaqaman, Dr. Lu Le and Dr. Sean
Morrison, who make up my advisory committee. The Pathway to Independence Award will provide the time,
resources and autonomy to fully develop and initiate this ambitious research program and accrue the
resources, expertise and experience necessary to launch an impactful, thriving research lab in Fall 2024."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia characterized by memory and cognitive loss interfering
with daily life. Clinical studies showed that the aberrant neuronal activity switch from hyperexcitability at the early
stage of disease to hypo-excitability at the late stage is a key feature shared in AD patients. In line with this,
levels of the principal excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT1/2), the
primary mediators of glutamate uptake into synaptic vesicles, were decreased at the late stage of AD patients,
which contributed to AD dementia. However, the underlying pathology that leads to glutamate misregulation,
aberrant neuronal activity and synaptic dysfunction in AD dementia remains largely unknown. Our recent work
identified histone H3K27 demethylase KDM6B as a specific epigenetic regulator of synaptic plasticity and
cognitive functions. Conditional knockout of KDM6B in the excitatory neurons reduced presynaptic vesicle
numbers, spine density and glutamate release/synaptic activity in mice. Moreover, KDM6B KO mice showed
behavioral learning and memory deficits. Importantly, KDM6B expression was reduced in aged brain, while
trimethyl lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) was increased in brain from late-onset AD patients, which were
highly correlated with their cognitive deficits. Tau was required for KDM6B recruitment and regulation in synaptic
plasticity and cognitive functions. Tau knockdown interfered with synaptic gene expression. As we know,
pathological Tau often occurred in AD and perturbed its physiological functions. These findings led us to
hypothesize that epigenetic alteration caused by KDM6B-Tau dysregulation contributes to aberrant neuronal
activity switch, cognitive impairment and AD pathogenesis. The goals of this R01 project are to 1) decipher the
role of pathological Tau in KDM6B-regulated synaptic activity and 2) determine effects of KDM6B dysregulation
on AD pathogenesis in AD mouse models. To ensure the success of the proposed project, we have assembled
a strong research team with expertise in AD-related neurodegeneration, epigenetic regulation, and synaptic
activity. If successful, this project will reveal the importance of Tau-KDM6B-dependent epigenetic priming in AD
pathogenesis and define a new epigenetic mechanism underlying synaptic hyper- and hypo-excitability switch
and cognitive impairment in AD, which may provide an innovative therapeutic target and a knowledge foundation
on development of a rational strategy to improve cognitive functions in AD patients."

Significance. Long-term opioid therapy (LTOT), previously standard care for chronic pain, led to enormous
increases in opioid-related morbidity and mortality. The CDC therefore issued opioid prescribing guidelines
in 2016, which was followed by a 70% decline in LTOT in healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA). Risks of LTOT taper or discontinuation are unclear and there is limited knowledge
about the barriers to and clinical effectiveness of the treatments used to supplement LTOT taper, such as
non-pharmacological modalities (NPM). Career Development Plan. Dr. Mannes’ training program will
include seminars, workshops, coursework, and conferences to develop his skills and expertise in electronic
health record (EHR) research methods, longitudinal and causal modeling, and health services research,
which are necessary for conducting his proposed research plan and achieving his career goals of becoming
an independent health services scientist who conducts large observational studies that will inform the
clinical care of people living with chronic pain. Mentorship. A highly accomplished team of mentors who
are experts in biostatistics, chronic pain management, and substance use epidemiology, will support Dr.
Mannes’ research and training goals. Research Plan. Dr. Mannes will conduct a clinical epidemiological
study informed by Andersen’s Model of Health Service Utilization that leverages the size and scope of the
VHA EHR (~5,000,000 patients each year) to answer the following questions: 1) What are the health risks
of LTOT taper or discontinuation since release of the CDC opioid prescribing guidelines, 2) Are veterans
who taper or discontinue LTOT more likely to receive NPM? 3) What are barriers to NPM utilization among
patients who taper or discontinue LTOT? and 4) Does NPM use improve health outcomes for patients who
taper or discontinue LTOT? To answer these important questions, Dr. Mannes will utilize retrospective
longitudinal cohort and cross-sectional study designs using data from 2016-2027. Generalized linear
models and Cox-proportional hazard models with Kaplan-Meier survival curves adjusted for
sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare facility characteristics will be used to examine associations
between LTOT taper and NPM with care termination, opioid or pain-related emergency department visits
or hospitalization, and suicide or overdose mortality. Findings from his study will inform an R01 that will be
among the first to use national, EHR data to examine barriers, uptake, and health effects of NPM using the
Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System. Public Health Impact. Increasing access to NPM
and identifying clinically effective NPM for people vulnerable to chronic pain are high priority areas for

10900609,"1 Eric B. Ortigoza, MD, MSCR is a Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine physician with a Master of Science in Clinical
 2 Research at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW). His goal is to be an independently funded investigator
 3 with expertise in neonatal gastrointestinal motility. He plans to investigate novel, comprehensive objective
 4 methods to differentiate developmental feeding intolerance (DFI) from pathologic feeding intolerance (PFI) with
 5 the goal of limiting unnecessary feeding delays, parenteral nutrition, and improving outcomes in preterm infants.
 6 In a prospective, longitudinal cohort study, preterm infants who are born <32 weeks’ gestation will undergo
 7 weekly non-invasive electrogastrography (EGG), abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (aNIRS), and stool
 8 collection. Dr. Ortigoza’s specific aims are to 1) quantify postmenstrual age-dependent differences in non-
 9 invasive continuous gastrointestinal monitoring in preterm infants with DFI, PFI, and no feeding intolerance (NFI),
10 and 2) measure postmenstrual age-dependent differences in the gut microbiome and microbiota-derived
11 metabolites in preterm infants with DFI, PFI, and NFI. Dr. Ortigoza’s innovative approach integrates objective
12 gastrointestinal biomarkers of gastric motility, mesenteric oxygenation, bacterial colonization, and microbiota-
13 derived metabolites to differentiate DFI from PFI. The ability to differentiate between the two conditions will
14 encourage the development of predictive models for PFI in preterm infants using bioinformatics and machine
15 learning. The ability to predict PFI will help develop evidence-based strategies aimed at preventing and/or
16 treating episodes of PFI. Dr. Ortigoza has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the
17 key areas of computational modeling of complex physiological variables (Lina Chalak, MD, MSCS), advanced
18 gut microbiome profiling (Andrew Koh, MD and Julie Mirpuri, MD), and metabolite analysis (Andrew Koh, MD).
19 UTSW and its strong clinical research operation provide the ideal environment to conduct the proposed studies
20 with the large patient population at Parkland Health and Hospital System (PHHS) and Children’s Health, a
21 dedicated Center for Translational Medicine, and a strong record of clinical research participation. Dr. Ortigoza’s
22 Career Development Plan includes a comprehensive focused strategy to address the specific key training skills
23 that will allow him to transition to independence including: 1) developing expertise in complex signal analysis of
24 EGG and aNIRS data, 2) gaining expertise in interpretation of high throughput analysis of the gut microbiome
25 and its derived metabolites, and 3) developing expertise in biomarker development/validation. In addition, he will
26 receive training to develop leadership skills that are critical to fostering a productive research team and building
27 a successful research program. Together with his scientific aims, these goals will provide the skills necessary
28 for Dr. Ortigoza to build his independent research program in neonatal gastrointestinal motility."

Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhalation of spores from the soil-dwelling fungi Coccidioides
immitis or C. posadasii, and can lead to chronic lung infection, meningitis, or death. Southwestern states are
currently experiencing among the highest incidence rates of coccidioidomycosis ever recorded. The disease
has levied a substantial human and economic burden throughout the southwest, totaling an estimated $2.2
billion in charges in California alone for coccidioidomycosis-associated hospitalizations from 2000-2011.
Critical gaps in understanding have hindered the public health response, including how dust, pathogen, and
individual risk factors interact to determine disease incidence, as well as how environmental factors influence
the distribution of the pathogen and dust. To address these gaps, this project investigates the impacts of dust
exposure, environmental variability, and sociodemographic change on Coccidioides spp. proliferation,
dispersion, and coccidioidomycosis infection rates in California. The research focuses on three main aims: 1)
investigate the influence of climate variation and dust exposure on the spatiotemporal distribution of cocci
incidence using >65,000 geolocated surveillance records from 2000 to 2018 and a case-crossover design; 2)
identify environmental sources of C. immitis at high spatial and temporal resolution in disturbed and
undisturbed soil, and determine how wind, rainfall, soil disturbance and other factors influence spore dispersion
through longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil; and 3) predict changes in pathogen density over
space and time and estimate the exposure-response relationship between pathogen density and risk of
infection using a case-crossover approach with prospective surveillance for incident cases. In pursuit of these
aims, the research will combine georeferenced coccidioidomycosis case data across California since 2000 at
an unprecedented spatial resolution with fine-scale dust concentration estimates and environmental data from
a combination of remote sensing, modeling and ground monitors. We will use novel field and laboratory
methods to conduct longitudinal sampling of C. immitis in air and soil, determining how microenvironmental
conditions and cyclical patterns of rainfall and drought determine pathogen source dynamics, and identifying
conditions that support pathogen dispersion through the air. Through these activities, we will identify the
specific dust conditions that pose the greatest risk for infection, estimate pathogen exposure and the dose-
response relationship, and evaluate heterogeneity in this relationship across risk groups and regions. The
results will elucidate drivers of the current epidemic, enhance understanding of the distribution and dispersion
of Coccidioides spp. in the environment, and identify high risk regions and subpopulations. The knowledge
gained will support decision-makers in targeting, designing and implementing protective measures for
vulnerable populations."

10902105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need to understand conditions across the lifespan that may contribute to sex and gender
differences in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) etiologies. We focus on reproductive history,
the most fundamental contributor to sex-specific health effects. Pregnancy and lactation are sensitive periods of
plasticity for human mothers as well as other mammals. During these life phases, permanent, re-organizing
effects transpire in various physiological systems, including the brain. Therefore, it is plausible that women’s
reproductive patterns modify the risks and mechanisms involved in neuropathogenesis across the lifespan. We
are galvanized by pilot results that both pregnancy and breastfeeding provided protection against women’s
ADRD onset as well as evidence of motherhood-related neurocognitive benefits in animal systems and human
postpartum neuroimaging studies. We capitalize on our trans-disciplinary perspective. Our project is cost-
efficient in utilizing available data and resources from an NIA-funded, large cohort study. We will analyze data
collected from 7,479 post-menopausal women age 65+ who participated in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
Memory Study (WHIMS) and from the subset of 2,304 women in the WHI Study of Cognitive Aging (WHISCA).
We will also conduct new measurements of brain atrophy in existing MRI images that were collected from the
subset of 1,403 women in the WHIMS-MRI study. We will use a highly sensitive, voxel-wise approach that is
powerful for visualizing sub-regional patterns of disease-related atrophy. Aim 1 will examine how women’s history
of pregnancy relates to ADRD classification, verbal memory, hippocampal ischemic volume, and atrophy using
voxel-wise approaches to measure cortical gray matter thickness and subcortical gray matter density. Aim 2 will
examine how women’s history of breastfeeding relates to the same list of ADRD-related pathology outcomes.
Both aims will test the interaction of APOE-ε4 carrier status. The ε4 allele is associated with miscarriage, reduced
fertility, and weaker estrogenic neuroprotection compared to ε3 and ε2, in addition to its association with
enhanced AD risk in some demographic groups. We predict that pregnancy-related and breastfeeding-related
ADRD resilience will be weaker in ε4 carriers. Also, we suspect reproductive history could potentially exert
differential effects on etiological pathways involved in different forms of dementia. Therefore, we will conduct
exploratory analyses stratifying the cohort by global ischemia. After this project, we plan to pursue an R01 to
examine endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic biomechanisms, working towards designing clinical
risk assessment tools. This project is responsive to the Notice of Special Interest: Sex and Gender Differences
in AD/ADRD which invites proposals on life course factors e.g., reproductive history, and sex-specific risk factors,
e.g., pregnancy. We address NIA’s ADRD Research Implementation Milestones 1.I to “identify critical periods of
life and critical lifestyle and other parameters with respect to cognitive impairment and dementia prevention” and
1.B to “employ a life-course approach” examining “information on early life exposures/events.”"
10742920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to the generation of a scar that is mostly constituted by cardiac extracellular
matrix (ECM). The balance between degradation and deposition of ECM is a strong predictor of clinical
outcomes. ECM degradation occurs by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); and ECM deposition occurs by
cardiac fibroblasts. Both ECM degradation and deposition promote adverse remodeling and progression to heart
failure. Within the MMP family, MMP-9 has been reported as a prognostic indicator of cardiac dysfunction in
myocardial infarction (MI) patients; as MMP-9 levels directly associate with patient mortality. Thus, the advantage
of inhibiting MMP-9 after MI has been long recognized. However, clinical trials using global MMP-9 inhibition
have mostly failed both due to lack of MMP inhibitor specificity and importance of MMP-9 in several essential
processes.
We recently identified an ECM-derived peptide (p1159) that acts as a competitive and specific MMP-9 substrate.
Herein, we propose use of p1159 to modulate MMP-9 cleavage of native substrates post-MI. This approach does
not inhibit MMP-9 activity, allowing it to participate in essential processes; instead, it modulates MMP-9
proteolytic capacity to reduce cleavage of endogenous substrates that promote inflammation and inhibit repair.
The synthetic peptide p1159 is a mimetic of the naturally formed fragment C-1158/59 generated by MMP-9
cleavage of collagen post-MI. In humans, plasma levels of endogenous C-1158/59 post-MI correlate with lower
left ventricle filling pressure, indicating a therapeutic potential of C-1158/59. Indeed, mice treated with exogenous
p1159 post-MI display less LV dilation, reduced inflammation and fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. In
vitro, we identified integrin α4 (Itga4) as a peptide receptor. While we know that exogenous delivery is beneficial,
how p1159 regulates post-MI inflammation and ECM deposition has not been mechanistically dissected.
Accordingly, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that p1159 blunts adverse remodeling after MI by serving
as a competitive substrate to reduce MMP-9 proteolysis of substrates necessary for promotion of inflammation
and ECM deposition. To elucidate the mode-of-action and signaling pathways mediated by p1159 in the post-MI
setting, we will use cell-specific Itga4 transgenic animals to identify the mechanisms whereby p1159 tempers
the post-MI inflammatory response, modulates cardiac fibroblast signaling to reduce ECM secretion; and
promotes macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk."
10899587,"ASM MOSAIC ABSTRACT
The American Society for Microbiology’s Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic
Independent Careers (ASM MOSAIC) program is a five-year initiative that will support early-career
scientists from minoritized groups to transition successfully from postdoctoral positions to tenure-track
faculty positions at research-intensive institutions. Increasing the number of faculty members from groups
historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics is essential to
advancing biomedical research in the United States. While the number of postdocs from minoritized
groups has modestly increased over the last couple of decades, the number of faculty at research -
intensive institutions has yet to show a similar increase. Increasing the number of scientists from
minoritized groups who pursue doctoral degrees is not enough to correct this imbalance, which requires
targeted interventions to help them succeed. ASM MOSAIC’s three phases will cover the skills needed to
(1) secure a faculty position at a research-intensive university, (2) excel in a faculty position, and (3)
become a scientific leader. All three phases will include courses and workshops for skill development and
mentoring. The program’s first specific aim focuses on the foundational skills required to gain faculty
positions. To address this aim, the program will pair each scholar with a network of mentors to help them
assess different career pathways, develop the skills needed to maximize their productivity as a
postdoctoral fellow, and transition to a faculty position. The mentors will consist of (i) an institutional
mentor, (ii) a scientific mentor, and (iii) a career development mentor. The second specific aim will help
the scholars embark on a successful tenure-track career and will cover setting goals, building
relationships with department leadership, establishing a research laboratory, and managing work-life
balance. The scholars will also take grant and manuscript writing courses and participate in mentorship
training. The third specific aim focuses on catalyzing the scholars’ progression to scientific leadership.
This phase of the program will provide the scholars with the skills to acquire sustained research funding,
build a scientific reputation and professional network, and understand the business of science. To grow
their networks, the scholars will attend two conferences: the ASM-managed Annual Biomedical Research
Conference for Minoritized Scientists (ABRCMS) and ASM’s annual flagship meeting, ASM Microbe.
Microbiologists and immunologists research basic life processes, promoting knowledge that improves
public health and the economic and environmental well-being of the United States. The ASM MOSAIC
program will support early-career scientists from minoritized groups to achieve successful careers as
microbiologists and immunologists and prepare them to mentor the next generation of scientists."
10907007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite extensive research, we still do not fully understand how neurons die in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients'
brains after withstanding decades of the accumulation of AD pathology. Oxidative damage and mitochondrial
deficits are proposed to contribute to or drive neurodegeneration in AD. AD brains show an accumulation of the
toxic end-product of lipid peroxidation 4-hydroxynoneal (4HNE), but it remains unclear what causes 4HNE to
accumulate in AD. Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of the increased sensitivity of mitochondria and
neurons in AD to oxidative damage is lacking. We determined that an atypical member of the glutathione S-
transferase (GST) superfamily, GDAP1 (Ganglioside Induced Differentiation Associated Protein 1), binds 4HNE
through a unique sequence motif called the α-loop, which is also essential for GDAP1 function. These data
collectively indicate that 4HNE is a GDAP1 substrate and that 4HNE binding to GDAP1 is essential for the
maintenance of cellular redox balance and mitochondrial function. Significantly, our preliminary RNAseq data
from AD patients and analysis of four AD proteomic datasets show significantly reduced levels of GDAP1 in the
prefrontal cortex of AD patients. As such, we hypothesize that GDAP1 protects mitochondria against oxidative
damage by neutralizing the highly toxic 4HNE and that reduced levels of GDAP1 render AD patient brains
vulnerable to 4HNE-mediated damage. We will test this hypothesis with two Aims. Aim 1 will determine the
mechanism of GDAP1-mediated cryoprotection including the mechanisms of 4HNE binding and detoxification.
Aim 2 will determine the impact of reduced levels of GDAP1 on mitochondrial function and accumulation of the
pathological hallmarks of AD in directly converted induced neurons from control subjects and AD patients. These
studies will establish the relationship between reduced GDAP1 levels, elevated 4HNE levels, and the increased
vulnerability of neurons in AD patients to oxidative damage and open a potential avenue for therapeutic
intervention in AD."
10913586,"Oligomeric forms of tau are the primary source of neurotoxicity in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases.
Structural studies of pathological tau aggregates isolated from tauopathy patient brains have uncovered a
diversity of disease-specific tau conformations and structural polymorphs, but the mechanism for how they
misfold into pathogenic species remains unknown. Here we aim to test a long-standing hypothesis that post-
translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation and acetylation at disease-associated sites, mediate
tau oligomerization, structural polymorph-dependent propagation, and neurotoxicity. We propose a bottom-up
approach for directly assessing the impact of pre-defined, disease-associated phosphorylation and acetylation
of full-length human tau. For the first time, we demonstrate that a state-of-the-art synthetic biology approach
enables the production of recombinant site-specifically phosphorylated tau (rp-tau), and that rp-tau with a single
modification is sufficient to adopt pathological conformations. This new capability will be expanded to include
site-specific lysine acetylation of tau to produce full-length tau with defined PTMs (including simultaneous
phospho- and acetyl-) implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). The new
reagents developed here will be used to determine the impact of site-specific tau PTMs on tau conformation
using cryo-EM, microtubule binding, oligomerization, neurotoxicity, and tau seeding. We will generate
monoclonal antibodies against tau with defined PTMs and AD/ADRD relevant conformations validated through
cryo-EM. The impact of the project will be to provide transferrable resources to test tau PTMs with unprecedented
resolution and uncover the molecular signature and mechanisms that mediate tau oligomerization,
conformational change, and seeding."

The highly specialized intestinal immune system is charged with maintaining tolerance to harmless stimuli from
food and commensal bacteria, while providing protective immunity against pathogens. Dysregulation of this
critical balance can lead to food allergy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or increased susceptibility to enteric
pathogens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in intestinal homeostasis, finely orchestrating immune
responses by presenting luminal antigens and inducing functional differentiation of CD4+ T cells into regulatory
or pro-inflammatory subsets. The cellular mechanisms underlying the decision between tolerance or immunity
to intestinal antigens remain unknown, largely because the identification and characterization of the exact DCs
involved in these processes has been a decades-long technical challenge. To overcome this problem, I
established the use of the LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)
technology in the gut, which enables proximity-dependent labeling of specific intestinal cell-cell interactions. The
main goal of this research proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms that determine whether DCs will induce
regulatory or pro-inflammatory T cells in vivo, by combining the LIPSTIC system with gene targeting, functional
imaging, intersectional genetics, and interaction-based transcriptomics approaches. This proposal tests the
hypothesis that DCs specialized for different functions exist in the intestine and that continuous dynamic
reprogramming of DCs subsets by luminal content dictate tolerance or immunity to food and microbes.
Specifically, this concept will be tested in mice under physiological (tolerance to food and microbes) and
pathological (allergic sensitization, enteric infection, and colitis) scenarios. To this end, the K99 mentored phase
(Aim 1) will reveal the exact nature of the DCs that induce tolerance or inflammation to food and the cellular and
molecular mechanisms by which food-specific pTregs maintain oral tolerance. Next, the R00 independent phase
(Aim 2) will focus on studying immune responses to commensals, with relevance to disorders such as colitis.
Elucidating the DC populations, location and molecular mechanisms involved in tolerance to distinct microbes
will reveal the nature of host-microbe interactions in health and disease. Together, this research program will
lend fundamental insight into the etiology of certain intestinal disorders and will provide foundation for the
development of new therapies for food allergy, colitis, and enteric infections, with profound implications for public
health. The proposed development plan complements my training in mucosal immunology and cellular
interactions with transcriptomics analysis, imaging, and mouse genetics. I will take advantage of the extensive
resources of the Rockefeller University, the mentorship of Dr. Daniel Mucida, Dr. Gabriel Victora and the Advisory
Committee team that will lend expertise in key aspects of the project and career development. At the end of the
mentored phase, I will be equipped with the necessary tools to conduct comprehensive studies at the intersection
of cellular communication and immune response to commensals as an independent investigator."

The inflammatory conditions and the complex physiological changes associated with chronic immunological
responses to wound healing in type 2 diabetes (T2DM) challenge the outcomes of the treatments for bone
regeneration. The related morbidity and costs associated with bone healing failures are considerable and
increasing. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that the immune system is tightly linked to bone physiology
and that MSC derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a prominent role in immunomodulation of bone repair.
While recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) mediated bone regeneration is well
established, the challenges of controlling inflammation arising from rhBMP2 usage is exacerbated in the
presence of immunomodulating systemic diseases such as T2DM present a significant knowledge gap that
limit clinical outcomes. Based on preliminary studies of inflammation informed MSC EV microRNA (miRNA)
composition and effects on immunomodulation and bone regeneration, we hypothesize that a dual delivery of
engineered MSC EVs with anti-inflammatory properties and rhBMP2 using a combinatorial delivery system with
self-assembling leucine zipper (LZ) peptide-based hydrogels and alginate beads can enhance bone healing in
T2DM. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis. In aim 1, we will test our preliminary data driven
hypothesis that a subset of altered miRNAs in preconditioned MSC EVs contributes to the enhanced
immunomodulatory function of the inflammatory preconditioned MSC derived EVs. We will also generate
engineered MSC EVs that overexpress candidate miRNA with anti-inflammatory properties to further study the
mechanistic aspects by which individual EV related miRNAs control the immunomodulation functionality. In aim
2, we will create a novel dual delivery system with LZ-hydrogels and alginate beads that contain engineered EVs
and rhBMP2 respectively. We will test our hypothesis that 1) EVs with anti-inflammatory properties (generated
from aim 1) can be released during the inflammatory phase of healing (up to 7 days) from a self-assembling LZ-
hydrogel and 2) rhBMP2 that is encapsulated in alginate beads with an extended-release profile (4-6 weeks) can
provide a long term osteoinductive signal to promote/enhance bone regeneration. In aim 3, using a diabetic
mouse calvarial defect model, we will test the hypothesis that engineered MSC EVs containing anti-inflammatory
miRNA will suppress inflammation upon wounding while sustained released rhBMP2 promote bone healing.
Overall, the results of these first studies of the combinatorial usage of engineered and MSC EVs rhBMP2 will
provide a foundation for continued definition of MSC EV-mediated immunomodulation, and the regenerative
properties and applicability of the dual delivery system to bone healing in T2DM. Further, these studies will also
provide a framework for the use of growth factors and engineered EVs in combination for tissue engineering
applications."

 A favorable target for radiation synthetic combinations would be a feature of cancer cells critically
involved in growth, signaling, repair, or survival that can be blocked with an otherwise non-toxic drug, leaving
tumors vulnerable to radiation without adverse effects on normal tissue. This project is directed at validating
inhibition of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) as a means to enhance the therapeutic index of radiation
and achieving key progress toward translating this strategy to the clinic. While TERT is not expressed in most
normal cells, approximately 90% of cancers display reactivation of TERT expression, supporting the catalytic
activity of telomerase to maintain telomere integrity despite deregulated growth. While drugs targeting TERT
have displayed sufficient safety in patients to evaluate effects of blocking telomere repeat synthesis, this has
failed in solid tumors, as telomere erosion is too slow to affect tumor progression. Beyond its essential role in
cancer cell immortality, TERT also contributes to pathways that support multiple cancer hallmarks. By limiting
oxidative stress, accelerating double strand break repair and supporting cell survival, TERT expression in
cancer cells may confer clinically significant resistance to radiation. This raises the question whether transiently
targeting TERT during radiotherapy to enhance the toxicity of the resulting DNA damage to the cancer cells
might significantly improve the therapeutic index of radiation.
 In recently published work, our groups described a novel class of TERT inhibitors inspired by the
antibiotic chrolactomycin. Like the natural product, our streamlined natural product analogs react with an active
site cysteine in the TERT reverse transcriptase active site. The optimized inhibitor, NU-1, is otherwise nontoxic
in vitro or in vivo, but inhibits telomerase activity at low micromolar concentrations. NU-1 confers sensitivity to
radiation to TERT-expressing cancer cells. Our data suggest that TERT may promote non-homologous end-
joining repair, thereby affecting repair pathway choice. Finally, using a syngeneic tumor model in BALB/c mice,
we have demonstrated marked sensitization to radiation in vivo, apparently mediated by persistent DNA
damage and increased anti-tumor immune response. With these preliminary studies in hand, we propose to 1)
Dissect the roles of TERT in double strand break repair and immune evasion, and 2) Improve the drug-like
properties of NU-1 and use these novel compounds to understand how best to obtain radiation sensitization
and an effective anti-tumor immune response."
10911366,"Project Summary. At present, there are no efficacious therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) to halt or slow disease
progression, which is attributed, at least in part, to the lack of translational cross-species molecular imaging tools
suitable for use in both preclinical disease models and in humans to facilitate drug discovery and development.
Therefore, the development of translatable imaging biomarkers for non-invasive assessment of disease progression
and therapeutic efficacy hold promises to fill this urgent and unmet medical need. N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor
(NMDAR) plays a pivotal role in the synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity thought to underlie learning and
memory. NMDAR activation has been implicated in AD related to synaptic dysfunction, which leads to gradual loss of
synaptic function and correlates clinically with the progressive decline in cognition/memory of AD patients. Therefore,
in vivo imaging of GluN2B is of paramount translational relevance as it would allow the assessment of GluN2B
distribution and expression of AD patients, enabling correlational study between NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and
neuroimmune factors during AD progression and providing target engagement tool to support novel AD
pharmacotherapy.
 Herein, we propose the use of a novel imaging strategy for monitoring detrimental extrasynaptic NMDAR function
in AD. Our strategy entails the use of a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [11C]Me-NB1, that targets
GluN2B-carrying NMDAR. To date, [11C]Me-NB1 is the only GluN2B PET tracer that has been successfully validated
in naïve animals and recently tested in a small number of healthy subjects. Our preliminary studies have shown that
[11C]Me-NB1-PET is highly suited for non-invasive mapping of the GluN2B subunit, with excellent target affinity and
selectivity across different species. However, non-invasive assessment of the distribution and expression of GluN2B
has not yet been conducted in AD patients and clear evidence is still deficient in demonstrating the underlying
mechanisms and a relationship between NMDAR dysfunction and AD. The availability of [11C]Me-NB1 now provides
new opportunity to fill this fundamental knowledge gap. Therefore, we have developed three objectives and hypothesis
in this work: (1) A kinetic modeling approach and absolute quantification, and/or simplified graphical methods of
[11C]Me-NB1 can be established in healthy controls; (2) PET quantification method will be translated into AD patients
and we expect increased GluN2B binding in vitro and in vivo by [11C]Me-NB1-PET is positively correlated with AD-
related brain regions in AD patients (versus controls); (3) As proof-of-concept, in transgenic AD mouse models, we
anticipate that [11C]Me-NB1-PET can directly monitor GluN2B changes and enable target occupancy studies during
novel AD therapy. Overall impact: The role of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in AD renders NMDAR subtype GluN2B
a potential drug and imaging target. [11C]Me-NB1-PET can not only track GluN2B changes and measure target
occupancy during novel AD therapeutic interventions, but also will support smaller, shorter trials for proof of
mechanism and also to facilitate optimal patient selection for clinical trials."

Cancer Institute of Emory University is a National Clinical Trial Network Lead Academic Participating Site and
boasts a robust clinical trial portfolio, enrolling roughly 1000 patients per year to therapeutic studies at multiple
sites throughout metropolitan Atlanta. I am the co-director of the lymphoma disease program, leader of the
lymphoma treatment modality working group, and chair of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee. In these roles
I can impact clinical trials in my clinic and throughout the Cancer Center. I have also assumed leadership of trials
through the ECOG-ACRIN lymphoma committee (PrE0404, A051201), have recently been appointed to
represent ECOG-ACRIN’s lymphoma committee on a Real World Evidence Working Group, and am the co-chair
of the lymphoma disease specific working group for Winship’s ETCTN consortium. As a result, I am well-
positioned to significantly impact of the success of NCI-funded studies. I will utilize the resources of the R50
Research Specialist Award to improve NCI-funded clinical trials through improved access and accrual to NCTN
and ETCTN trials in Atlanta and the state of Georgia by strengthening existing collaborations with oncologists
throughout the state in association with Winship’s Office of Community Outreach and Engagement. This will
include expansion of tumor boards and national programming, 1:1 in person and virtual communication with
colleagues, and facilitation of opportunities to enroll patients in NCTN studies closer to their home communities.
I will continue to develop a pipeline of junior investigators and trainees nationwide who are interested in clinical
trials and will ensure they have access to NCTN and ETCTN support to support development of their own
concepts. I will develop the next series of trials by utilizing my experience as a leader in Real World Evidence
cohorts, both within ECOG-ACRIN and with colleagues throughout the country. I will continue growth of the
NCTN and ETCTN at Winship and will ensure that colleagues continue to have innovative studies to which to
enroll patients and have the skills needed to develop their own projects based on current and future clinical
needs."
10724243,"Protein aggregation underlies most or all types of neurodegeneration and many
other age-progressive diseases. We have isolated and analyzed very pure aggregates
from Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD); nematode models of
Huntington’s Disease (HD), AD, and PD; and human cell-culture models of AD. The
proteins that contribute to these aggregates show considerable overlap; for example,
>80% of proteins that are significantly more abundant in aggregates from AD than from
age-matched controls, are shared and concordant in amyloid plaque (containing Aβ1-42)
and in neurofibrillary tangles containing hyperphosphorylated tau), although these
aggregates have long been thought to be exclusively extracellular and intra-neuronal,

ability to disrupt protein coalescence in vivo. Several drugs have the ability to reduce or
slow aggregate accrual, and one (PNR502) has been shown to reverse aggregation in
both mouse and nematode models of AD-like amyloidosis. We are currently in the
process of performing quantitative structure-activity studies to enable the generation of
2nd-generation drugs, further optimized for desirable drug properties. Two patents have

the first of these addresses PNR502 and several of its structural analogs."
10891701,"Kinesins are eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins best known for their motile activity, but they are also
important regulators of microtubule dynamics, the ability of the microtubule polymer to grow or
shrink. This project seeks to establish the molecular mechanisms and adaptations that allows
different members of the kinesin superfamily to move along microtubules or to modulate
microtubule dynamics. Regulation of microtubule dynamics by kinesins play important roles in a
variety of cell processes such as mitosis, cytokinesis, neural development and the control of cilia
and centriole length, but the mechanisms by which these kinesins stabilize or destabilize
microtubules is still not fully clear. It is also not clear what conformational changes kinesins induce
on the microtubule and whether these conformational changes are transmitted through the
microtubule to allosterically modulate the binding of kinesin and other proteins along microtubules.
To address these questions, we will perform cryo-electron microscopy structural and functional
studies of motile and microtubule depolymerase kinesins, and their effect on microtubule
structure. The proposal is divided into three aims: 1) Determine the allosteric effects of kinesin
binding on microtubule structure and function. 2) Determine the mechanism of combined motile
and microtubule depolymerization activities of Kinesin-8s. 3) Determine the origin of different
functionalities among microtubule depolymerase kinesins."

10914934,"Abstract: Breast cancer (BC), the most common cancer globally as of 2021 and accounting for 12% of all new
annual cancer cases worldwide, is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. Based on
the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2), breast cancer can be classified into three major subtypes: luminal subtype (ERa/PR+,
HER2-), HER2+ subtype (ERa/HR-, HER2+), and triple-negative subtype (TNBC, ERa/HR-, HER2-). All types of
BC have metastatic potential. TNBC is the deadliest form. Chemoresistance is a major obstacle to therapeutic
efficacy. Once chemoresistance develops, metastatic BC is incurable. Cancer immunotherapy has achieved
unprecedented success in treating many types of advanced cancers, including TNBC. However, the response
rate of BC patients to cancer immunotherapy is low because of the poor tumor infiltration of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL). Developing more effective cancer immunotherapy approaches is critical to treating and curing
TNBC patients. Using a T cell receptor (TCR)-alpha deficient Ja281 KO mouse model, we found that transferring
thymocytes into Ja281 KO mice could completely inhibit EO771 and Py8119 TNBC growth in these cell-
transferred mice. We further found that the cell transfer-induced antitumor immunity was mediated by tissue-
resident αβ+CD4-CD8- double-negative T (DN T) cells formed from the transplanted donor population and
depended on host NK cells. Deciphering the underlying mechanism will allow us to develop a powerful
immunotherapy approach for TNBC treatment. The long-term goal of our research is to develop new
immunotherapeutic regimens for cancer treatment. The objective of this project is to decode the mechanism of
DN T cell antitumor immunity to TNBC. Our central hypothesis is that DN T cells initiate antitumor immunity and
interact with NK cells to control TNBC growth and to shape tumor microenvironment (TME) and that a population
of immunoinhibitory T cells modulate DN T cell antitumor function. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the
following three specific aims: Aim 1: Determine how tissue-resident DN T cells are generated and how they
mediate antitumor immunity using the Ja281 KO mouse model. Aim 2. Determine the antitumor function of
tissue-resident DN T/NK cell axis. Aim 3: Define the immunoregulatory cells that govern tissue-resident DN T
cell generation and their antitumor function. The finding that tissue-resident DN T cells can inhibit TNBC growth
and eradicate breast cancer is novel. The completion of the proposed research will not only greatly advance our
knowledge of DN T cells in antitumor immunity, but also allow us to develop more effective approaches for TNBC
immunotherapy."
10932217,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This project studies the mechanism of neurologic toxicity in chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell
therapy. CAR T cells are genetically modified, patient derived T cells that use the CAR to recognize and destroy
malignant target cells. Although CAR T therapy has shown impressive results against leukemia and lymphoma,
approximately 30-40% of patients experience neurologic side effects in the first month after receiving CD19-
targeted CAR T cells. This includes cognitive disturbances, seizures, and in rare cases fatal cerebral edema.
Systemic cytokine release syndrome after CAR T cell infusion is a well-established risk factor for neurotoxicity,
but the connection between systemic inflammation and brain dysfunction is poorly understood.
 To study the mechanisms of neurotoxicity, we have developed an immunocompetent mouse model. After
treatment with high dose CD19-directed murine CAR T cells, mice develop motor and balance difficulties, as
well as brain microhemorrhages. Surprisingly, we found that >10% of cortical capillaries are obstructed by white
blood cells during neurotoxicity. This was accompanied by capillary remodeling and decreased vessel coverage
by pericytes. Based on these findings, we now propose the following experiments:
Aim 1: What molecular mechanisms cause white blood cells to plug capillaries during neurotoxicity? We
will use in vivo two-photon imaging in mice to determine which cell types cause the capillary plugging – the
mouse’s own or the transferred CAR T cells? We will then measure how CAR T cell treatment changes the
expression of adhesion molecules in brain capillary endothelial cells and in leukocytes, and test whether
blockade of these adhesion interactions can prevent capillary plugging and neurotoxicity.
 Aim 2: Is neuroendothelial-leukocyte adhesion increase in human microvessels during neurotoxicity? In
parallel to our work in mice, we will use a 3D in vitro model of human brain capillaries to measure how soluble
factors in patient plasma affect adhesion molecule expression in the endothelium. We will then test whether
white blood cells from CAR T cell patients with neurotoxicity have increased predilection for plugging synthetic
microvessels that mimic capillaries, and whether we can prevent this plugging by blocking adhesion molecules.
 Aim 3: Can the strength of cell-cell adhesion signaling separate CAR T cell efficacy from toxicity? We will
use quantitative multiplex immunoprecipitation to probe protein-protein interaction networks in CAR T cells that
cause high or low neurotoxicity in mice to understand what activation states are conducive to neurotoxicity. We
will then test whether knock down of adhesion molecule expression can direct CAR T cells away from a toxicity
phenotype by impairing their ability to signal to other cells, and to adhere to the brain microvasculature.
 This work is innovative because it combines advanced imaging, in vitro modeling techniques, and protein
network analysis in a unique collaboration between neuroscience, vascular biology, and oncology. The work is
significant because it addresses key safety issues in emerging cancer immunotherapy modalities."
10857227,"|| ABSTRACT
Breakdown of the endothelial cell barrier is considered a defining pathological hallmark of multiple diseases.
Indeed, sepsis accounts for more hospital deaths per year than any other condition in the United States, and the
disease is currently devoid of any targeted pharmacological intervention. Critical to understanding how
inflammation affects vascular barrier function is that endothelial cells throughout the circulatory system are not
homogenous. Inflammation specifically affects vascular permeability through effects on the venous endothelium,
whereas the arterial endothelium is not susceptible to inflammation-induced permeability and instead primarily
regulates blood pressure. Thus, a mechanistic view of how venous endothelial barrier function is regulated is
essential to human health and disease. Our current understanding of vascular barrier function does not account
for endothelial heterogeneity and the unique cell adhesion and signaling pathways specific to each endothelial
cell type. Purinergic signaling has been identified as a key regulator of endothelial permeability; however the
cellular pathway allowing for simultaneous regulation of the purine response and tight junctions has not been
explored. We hypothesize that the purine release channel pannexin (Panx)1 in venous endothelium is a
component of a dynamic signaling nexus activated upon inflammatory stimuli such as sepsis. We will use three
aims to test this concept. In Aim 1, we will identify kinase signaling pathways targeting Panx1 that regulate
venous permeability. This aim will use novel mouse models with point mutations in Panx1 for post-translational
modification and measure how these key modifications alter pathological responses to cecal ligation puncture
(CLP) sepsis model, venous permeability, and ATP release. Aim 2, we will measure the impact of claudin11
(cldn)11 on the intracellular distribution of Panx1 and organization of other components required for
purinergic signaling in response TNFa stimulated venous permeability. Based on our previous work, we
found cldn11 to be uniquely expressed across the venous endothelium that was selectively broken down in
response to TNFa/sepsis; this contrasted with claudin5. Here was posit cldn11 is a unique signaling hub due to
its ability to be regulated by changes in calcium, and that property of the tight junction regulates Panx1 function
on venous endothelium. Last, in Aim 3 we will determine roles for internalization and turnover of
components of the Panx1/Cldn11 hub in regulation of venous permeability. Turnover and reseting the
signaling complex is an important component to the cellular response to inflammation. In this aim we provide
evidence that caveolin1 facilitates recycling of both Panx1 and cldn11 after inflammatory stimuli, and probe the
mechanisms of how this may occur. The feasibility of accomplishing these aims is underscored by all proposed
knockout mice being in hand, coupled with strong preliminary data and a highly productive previous funding cycle
between the two investigators."
10919849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The impact of heart transplantation (HTx) remains limited by donor shortages, with an estimated 250,000 adults
who may benefit from transplant despite only 3,500 being performed each year in the US. Unfortunately, donor
discard rates remain high at 70-80%, with substantial unexplained variability in donor evaluation and acceptance
practices between centers. Recent data also demonstrate that higher risk recipients are being transplanted
under the new 2018 allocation policy with worse post-transplant survival rates nationally. These trends
collectively underscore current limitations in allocation policy and the ability for individual programs to assess
donor quality and to pair suitable donors with appropriately selected recipients. The latter stems from a
suboptimal process whereby clinicians have to make time-sensitive decisions relying solely upon experience
and judgement without data-driven tools that can analyze numerous donor and recipient data and their complex
interactions to provide rapid and accurate outcome projections. Existing risk models have failed to garner
widespread utilization due to major limitations, including 1) narrow focus on only one of a set of relevant
outcomes, 2) simplistic approach with only modest discriminatory capability (c-statistics <0.70), 3) failure to
account for complex interactions between donor and recipient variables, and 4) use of only static, cross-sectional
data. Our proposal seeks to advance the field by leveraging a novel, comprehensive dataset and machine
learning (ML) to develop robust models that can maximize predictive performance for relevant outcomes and to
better align a candidate's clinical trajectory and anticipated transplant outcome. These models will better account
for complex interrelationships between donor and recipient variables, and will also account for dynamic changes
in candidate and donor parameters. Optimized models will then be incorporated into a decision support system
guided by key stakeholders. In addition, a previously developed artificial intelligence (AI) framework will be used
to optimize heart allocation policy. We have these specific aims: 1) Establish the feasibility and usability of a
stakeholder-guided, ML-derived decision support system for adult HTx; 2) Demonstrate the adaptability of a
previously developed AI-based policy-optimization framework to heart allocation; and 3) Inform and evaluate the
processes and outputs of Specific Aims 1 and 2 using stakeholder engagement and implementation science to
refine and optimize working prototypes and promote the understanding, adoption, and use of data-driven
decision support tools created for HTx. This work will optimize the allocation of scarce resources and ultimately
improve outcomes of HTx."
10906986,"Project Abstract
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a target for non-invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of substance use
disorders (SUDs). Due to its location deep in the brain, transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is unique
among non-invasive brain stimulation methods to be able to focus on the NAc with high spatial resolution. TUS
has been shown to be safe and effective in animal models. It is currently under active investigation in humans.
However, a major concern in the use of TUS in human studies is the potential for an off-target auditory
stimulation by bone-conducted sound, making the study susceptible to placebo and attention effects, which are
relevant in most studies of neurological disorder interventions. The purpose of this proposed research is to
increase the rigor and safety, and therefore success, of TUS in the treatment of SUDs, and TUS more
generally, thereby enabling truly innovative science. We will do this by accurately quantitating the hearing
response from TUS waveforms in humans, including correlation to skull morphology, and designing and testing
a framework for creating waveforms that reduce audibility while improving masking, all while still providing the
flexibility needed by TUS researchers. We will do this for stimulation waveforms and for MR-ARFI waveforms,
which we show in preclinical data provide a measure of the dose-response to the ultrasound stimulation."
10896191,"Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) is classically defined as a protein of the desmosome, an intercellular adhesion structure
residing in the cardiac intercalated disc (ID). Mutations in PKP2 associate with most cases of gene-positive
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a disease characterized by high propensity to life-
threatening arrhythmias and myocardial structural damage, often of right ventricular predominance. Much
attention has been given to the loss of cell-cell attachment at the ID as a disease mechanism. Yet, it is becoming
evident that PKP2 mutations also lead to an array of poorly understood cardiomyocyte (CM)-intrinsic
disturbances. Desmin intermediate filaments are anchored to the desmosome in a PKP2-dependent manner,
supporting CM structural integrity and facilitating communication from the cell surface to the nucleus. Our prior
work in mouse models and human patient samples found PKP2 mutation disrupts CM nuclear envelope (NE)
integrity and leads to DNA damage. Based on published reports and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
PKP2 deficiency, or disease relevant PKP2 mutations, disrupt the structural, functional and molecular integrity
of the cardiomyocyte nuclear envelope, leading to genomic reorganization, the DNA damage response, and
altered transcription. The following aims will investigate how PKP2 deficiency disrupts the nucleus to accelerate
ARVC disease progression.
Aim 1: Define the impact of PKP2 deficiency on the cardiomyocyte nuclear lamina protein interactome.
We hypothesize that PKP2 deficiency alters the proteome of the cardiomyocyte NE, and that this disruption is
an early trigger for the disease phenotype. We will interrogate changes in the molecular ecosystem of the
cardiomyocyte NE after loss of PKP2 expression using proteomics and single molecule imaging.
Aim 2: Define the impact of PKP2 deficiency on cardiomyocyte genomic organization.
We hypothesize that loss of NE integrity in PKP2 deficient CMs disrupts genomic organization at Lamin
Associated Domains and causes transcriptional remodeling. We will determine how structural damage is
transmitted from the cell membrane to the genome, focusing on changes that occur in the vicinity of the NE
through advanced imaging, genomic and transcriptomic approaches.
Aim 3: Investigate strategies to reduce DDR and delay cardiomyopathy in PKP2 deficient mice.
We hypothesize data that PKP2 mutation induces P53-dependent DNA damage response (DDR), which may
exacerbate ARVC disease progression. Genetic epistasis experiments and pharmacological approaches will
investigate how the P53-dependent DDR contributes to PKP2-dependent cardiomyopathy.
 Defining pathological changes to nuclear architecture that precede overt myocardial structural remodeling
will reveal exciting opportunities for new therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing ARVC disease progression by
restoring nuclear envelope homeostasis or preventing the DNA damage response."
10928209,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BRCA2, as part of the DNA repair pathway, is a key regulator in homology-directed repair (HDR) and fork protection
mechanism, which ensures genome instability. For full activity, BRCA2 must be transported into the nucleus to repair
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In normal cells, loss of nuclear BRCA2 can lead to genome instability and cancer
but, in tumor cells, BRCA2 cytosolic mislocalization can lead to sensitivity to targeted therapies.
I identified a paradoxical relationship between BRCA2 nuclear import and treatment. Pathogenic missense mutations
in the DNA binding domain of BRCA2 direct the protein to the cytosol which increase sensitivity to PARP inhibitors
(PARPi) and platinum drugs. Therefore, although BRCA2 mislocalization might be a cause of cancer, keeping it
out of the nucleus allows for much better treatment outcomes. This has opened an avenue of research that I am
perfectly aligned to study. In this K22 proposal I will address the nuclear transport of BRCA2, how cancer-driver
mutations lead to cytosolic mislocalization and how BRCA2 localization can be used as a diagnostic tool. To test this, I
will define the molecular mechanism(s) regulating nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of BRCA2 pathogenic missense
variants (Aim 1), determine the impact of BRCA2 cellular localization on HDR, fork protection and cytosolic processes
(Aim 2) and exploit BRCA2 localization as a cancer diagnostic tool (Aim 3). My priority will be to focus on missense
variants identified during my postdoctoral career to decipher the underlying molecular mechanism of nuclear/cytosolic
BRCA2 trafficking. At the successful completion of this K22 proposal, I will reveal novel pathways and factors that ensure
proper localization of BRCA2 and how pathogenic BRCA2 missense variants have altered localization and functionality.
This knowledge will give us a better understanding of the pathogenicity of BRCA2 missense variants and how we can
modulate the functionality of BRCA2.
My career goal is to obtain an independent position at a leading institution where I will dissect the functionality of
missense variants in DNA repair proteins and how their cellular localization is important for genome stability as a tool to
predict cancer risk and to treat cancer patients. My successful transition will be supported by advancing my expertise in
cell biology, biochemistry, mass spectrometry and human cellular models. I will use these acquired skills to define why
and how certain pathogenic BRCA2 missense variants are mislocalized to the cytosol. Importantly, the protected time
that this award provides me will allow me to elucidate the factors and pathways by which BRCA2 is transported from
the cytosol to the nucleus, how this might be altered in BRCA2 missense variants and how this could be used for
targeted therapies. Furthermore, the success of this project will be greatly enhanced by the outstanding advisors and
collaborators that advise me through the K22 period. The receipt of this award will allow me to expand my research plan
and establish myself as a principal investigator in the field of cancer biology."
10904937,"Summary
 Subclinical psychotic symptoms are a pluripotent transdiagnostic risk factor, associated both with an
increased risk of subsequently developing a serious mental illness (psychotic or non) and current psychiatric
distress. However, attempts to prevent the onset of these chronic illnesses in individuals with subclinical
psychotic symptoms have had limited success. This may be due to the majority of prior studies focusing on a
relatively late stage of risk, when the illness processes are possibly well underway and thus more difficult to
reverse. Intervening earlier in the lifespan, during adolescence - a time characterized by high levels of
neuroplasticity - could be particularly important for preventive interventions, while also addressing the highly
pressing current need for more mental health services for youth.
 During the past few years, we have developed and tested a brief, group-based intervention for young
adults, called Resilience Training (RT). RT focuses on increasing capacities that support social functioning,
including social cognition, the neuropsychological processes involved in accurately perceiving others and their
mental states. When these capacities are enhanced, such improvements may lead to lower rates of
psychopathology. In two published trials, we have reported that RT led to reductions in a range of symptoms
and improved social functioning. Additionally, improvements in social cognition, particularly in Theory of Mind,
the ability to understand the mental states of others, are linked to RT-related decreases in psychiatric
symptoms and improvements in social functioning in this at-risk young adult group.
 Based on these prior findings, the goal of the proposed project is to adapt RT for at-risk adolescents
who will be recruited using a brief mental health screening administered in their high schools, which will identify
those who have subclinical psychotic symptoms but are not yet receiving any mental health treatment. We will
first test the adapted intervention for its feasibility and acceptability in this population, and then conduct a pilot
randomized, waitlist-controlled trial, to test for its efficacy in reducing transdiagnostic symptoms and improving
social functioning. We will also measure whether the proposed target mechanism of the intervention, social
cognition, plays a role in any intervention-related improvements. If the hypotheses of this project are confirmed,
it will be followed by a definitive, longitudinal, randomized control trial, which will measure the efficacy of this
novel intervention for preventing disability in transdiagnostically at-risk adolescents.
 During the course of this project, with the guidance of a highly experienced multi-disciplinary
mentorship team, coursework, and a comprehensive training plan that involves training in research on social
cognition, adolescent mental health, longitudinal biostatistics, and intervention adaptation, the applicant will
develop the necessary knowledge and skills to become an independent intervention researcher, focused on
developing approaches for the prevention and treatment of serious mental illnesses in young people."

 Mitochondria are critical for cells with high energy demand. Mitochondrial ATP synthase completes the final
step of ATP production. Mutations in ATP synthase cause a range of diseases, including Schizophrenia, and
heart failure. Thus, the basic biology of ATP synthase is important for health and disease.
 The subunits of the ATP synthase are encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genome. A unique challenge
of assembling the ATP synthase is to coordinate the gene expressions from dual genetic origins. Recent studies
showed that cytosolic and mitochondrial translation are temporally synchronized to maintain the stoichiometry of
the ATP synthase subunits (Couvillion, M.T., et al. Nature, 2016; Soto, I, et al. Genome Biology, 2022). However,
the underlying mechanism of the cross-compartment communication remains largely unknown. I aim to fill in the
knowledge gap in this proposed study. Using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) in yeast,
I imaged the mRNAs of a nuclear-encoded subunit, ATP2, and a mitochondrial-encoded subunit, ATP6/8. I
discovered that the ATP2 and ATP6/8 mRNA co-localized on the mitochondrial network. Based on this
observation, I hypothesize that the cytosolic and mitochondrial translation co-localize on opposite sides of the
mitochondrial double membrane, thereby promoting the assembly of the ATP synthase. In Aim 1, I propose to
determine how the ATP2 mRNAs co-translationally associate with mitochondria. In Aim 2, I will define the spatial
coordination between the cytosolic and mitochondrial mRNAs in yeast and cultured neurons. In Aim 3, I shall
identify the regulating proteins and dissect the underlying mechanism of the cross-compartment co-localization.
This study will uncover a novel mechanism by which cells spatially coordinate the nuclear and mitochondrial
gene expressions during mitochondrial biogenesis.
 My PhD training with Dr. Peter Walter prepared me with the skills in organelle biology, yeast cell biology, and
biochemistry. My postdoctoral training with Dr. Robert Singer equipped me with the expertise in single-molecule
imaging. These complementary skills give me the unique opportunity to conduct this proposed study. During the
K99 phase, Dr. Singer will help me develop the skills to image mRNAs in yeast and cultured neurons. Extending
my research from yeast to neurons will increase the impact of my future research. Dr. Michael Rout (Co-Mentor)
will provide the expertise to identify the proteins that bind to the co-localizing mRNAs. Dr. Liza Pon (Co-Mentor),
Dr. Thomas Fox (Consultant), and Dr. Christof Osman (Collaborator) form my mitochondrial mentoring team.
Their diverse background will allow me to acquire the knowledge and skills of different aspects of mitochondria.
This study will open opportunities to study the spatial regulation of mitochondrial gene expression. It will serve
as a foundation for an independent research program in my future laboratory."

Lyme disease (LD) is a multisystem infectious disorder caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). With
an estimated 476,000 cases diagnosed and treated annually, LD is easily the most prevalent arthropod-borne
infection in the United States. Transit of Bb between vector and reservoir host involves an intricate and poorly
understood coordination of gene expression with control of motility. Differential gene expression in Bb is
orchestrated, in large part, by two global regulatory networks – the RpoN/RpoS pathway and the Hk1/Rrp1 two
component system (TCS). The RpoS pathway is activated by the bloodmeal during transmission, remains ON
throughout mammalian infection, and rapidly turns OFF during larval acquisition. The Hk1/Rrp1 pathway
signals via the second messenger bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) synthesized
by Rrp1, a diguanylate cyclase, in response to unidentified molecules generated during the larval and nymphal
blood meals. c-di-GMP exerts pleiotropic effects in LD spirochetes. Bb lacking Hk1 or Rrp1 are destroyed in ticks
during acquisition and transmission but are fully virulent in mice. Δrrp1 Bb display aberrant motility in vitro,
indicating that c-di-GMP also impacts flagellar rotation. c-di-GMP-dependent responses often are mediated by
binding to proteins with a PilZ domain. Accordingly, efforts to unravel c-di-GMP signaling in Bb have centered
about PlzA, the sole PilZ domain protein in most LD spirochetes. In feeding ticks, ΔplzA Bb phenocopy Δhk1 and
Δrrp1 mutants. Paradoxically, in mice, where the Hk1/Rrp1 TCS is OFF, PlzA deficiency markedly attenuates
infectivity, implying a c-di-GMP independent function for PlzA in mammals. In other bacteria, PilZ proteins
(e.g., YcgR) slow motility by directly interfering with the flagellar motor. Surprisingly, inhibition of Bb motility
by c-di-GMP appears to be PlzA-independent. This proposal is intended to achieve an integrated conceptual and
mechanistic framework for c-di-GMP signaling and PlzA functions across the entire enzootic cycle. Experiments
in Aim 1, are designed to elucidate how PlzA functions as a c-di-GMP biosensor to promote both tick and
mammalian host-adaptation by Borrelia burgdorferi. In Subaim 1.1, we will investigate the ability of liganded-
PlzA to bind to a c-di-GMP regulated promoter (glp operon) using EMSAs and DNA-protein interaction analysis,
and generate PlzA point mutants to identify residues responsible for DNA-binding. In Subaim 1.2, we use pull-
down and site-directed mutagenesis to gain insight into the protein-protein interactions that enable unliganded
PlzA to fulfill its c-di-GMP-independent, mammalian host-specific functions. Aim 2 is designed to deconvolute
the contribution(s) of c-di-GMP to spirochete motility and biphasic dissemination at the tick-mammal interface.
In Subaim 2.1, we will use gelatin matrices as an ex vivo tick midgut surrogate to monitor spirochete motility in
response to the blood meal. In Subaim 2.2, we will determine whether decreased levels of c-di-GMP are required
for Bb to transition back to motility and/or exit the midgut during transmission."

approaches to facilitate the use of these data to identify genes with correlated expression patterns.
Using these resources, we can observe robust co-expression patterns that may not stand out in single
experiments. We found that known microoxic fitness genes are significantly correlated in expression
patterns with each other and with a large set of uncharacterized genes. In Aim 1, we will construct
mutants in candidate microoxic fitness genes, analyze their fitness in microoxic and normoxic
conditions, and compare the phenotype observed using single mutants to the results from a Tn-Seq
performed in similar conditions. In light of our data that show that medium composition and strain
background can influence the expression level of microoxic fitness genes even when cell density and
O2 availability are constant, in Aim 2, we will use transcriptome compendia to identify conditions in
which microoxic fitness genes are most highly expressed. We will use those conditions to assess the
phenotypes of mutants in candidate microoxic fitness genes. Prioritized hits will be validated by
complementation and further characterized in future work. Upon completion of these studies, we will
have expanded our knowledge of microoxic fitness determinants, and we will have tested a strategy for
leveraging public transcriptomics data for identifying candidate genes and assay conditions that might
be broadly useful in other systems and for other processes."

The Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) requests support to maintain retention and
engagement of its unique environmental cohorts, enhance basic laboratory and data management resources,
increase community outreach, and set the stage for new partnerships and training opportunities to evaluate
cumulative oxidative damage from prenatal exposure to mixtures of environmental pollutants. Currently, over
1,000 children are enrolled in the CCCEH cohorts, including the Mothers and Newborns cohort, the
Sibling/Hermanos cohort, and the Fair Start cohort; we expect that we will have a total enrollment of 1,500
children by 2023. The CCCEH cohorts are comprised of mothers and children who are low income and minority
(largely African-American and Latino). Therefore, it is of critical importance to retain these participants, their
associated biorepositories, and the environmental health data they have provided through increased
engagement activities, more laboratory resources, and enhanced data management, preparation, and sharing.
Impressively, over the past 20 years, the Center has collected over 4,100,416 for 31,742 variables and 8,478
standardized derived variables. The exposures studied in these cohorts include diverse toxic pollutants and
chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), phthalates, pesticides, bisphenol A (BPA),
environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) flame retardants. The Center
has also collected a wealth of outcome data from anthropometric measures, neurodevelopmental assessments,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and health records. The support will facilitate the Center’s outreach efforts
to guide behaviors and inform policies to reduce exposures of pregnant women and children to toxic chemicals
and pollutants. It will lay the groundwork for new collaborations across cohorts by incorporating novel biological
measures that can provide new insight on the mechanisms of exposure-related disease. To develop a novel
biomarker for assessing cumulative damage in mtDNA, the Center will integrate information from high-throughput
screening programs (such as Tox21 and ToxCast™) to inform mixture models based on mitochondrial toxicity.
The Center will also develop a new inter-institutional collaboration with Mount Sinai School of Medicine that will
compare mtDNA measures in our CCCEH cohorts with the same measures in their birth cohort from Mexico
City. Given the urgent need to prevent environmentally related diseases and neurodevelopment disorders in
children, strong infrastructure support is warranted to maintain and preserve our Center’s unique resources,
prepare for future research directions, and ensure effective communication of our findings."
10742914,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cholecystokinin acts on type 1 receptors (CCK1Rs) present on vagal afferent neurons to regulate
satiety, important in prevention and treatment of obesity. While CCK1R agonists can acutely reduce feeding,
such agents with high potency and long duration of action tend to be associated with side effects and potential
toxicity not tolerated for chronic therapy of healthy people. It is also now clear that a subset of the population is
refractory to effects of CCK agonists, due to impact of membrane cholesterol on receptor conformation and
dysfunctional stimulus-activity coupling, likely negatively affecting previous clinical trials. Our long term
objective is to target this receptor in a safer and more effective way. The underlying hypothesis is that lack
of mechanistic understanding of interplay between disease states (obesity) and receptor function, and under-
appreciation of novel modes of GPCR drug targeting are key barriers to realizing the therapeutic potential of
CCK1R drugs. Efforts will focus on acquiring molecular understanding of how the membrane environment
affects CCK1R structure and function, and utilizing these insights to pursue opportunities for allosteric
modulation to correct negative impact, and for ligand-directed bias to sculpt signaling and regulatory responses
to activators of this therapeutic target. We will utilize a strong, well-established collaboration, reflecting the
highly complementary skills and experience of Drs. Miller and Sexton. Aim 1 provides a coherent assessment
of signaling and regulatory events initiated by stimulation of CCK1R with orthosteric agonists and allosteric
drugs, and impact of membrane lipids on these events. This provides the opportunity to link distinct ligand
pharmacologies to impact effector engagement, regulatory protein recruitment, control of G protein efficacy,
and receptor sequestration and trafficking, as well as how allosteric cooperativity between sites of molecular
interaction can modify these events. This aim also includes quantification of kinetics of agonist ligand binding
and the events of the G protein cycle that are interdependent, yielding aberrant stimulus-activity coupling with
high binding affinity and reduced signaling at CCK1R in elevated cholesterol. Aim 2 explores the physical
basis for this process, focusing on the site of lipid interaction outside the receptor helical bundle, and its impact
on the mode of natural peptide ligand docking at the ectodomain of this receptor. These studies will utilize
focused chimeric CCK1R:CCK2R constructs, as well as a series of site-directed mutants, and photoaffinity
labeling and fluorescence probing. Aim 3 provides a structural framework for understanding aberrant CCK
stimulus-activity coupling at CCK1R, utilizing our recent structural breakthroughs in determination of active-
state structures of agonist-occupied CCK1R in complex with heterotrimeric G proteins using cryo-EM. These
studies provide a unique paradigm for the investigation of potential drug targets that are affected by the
composition of the plasma membrane in which they reside."
10742919,"The overall objective of this research proposal is to elucidate a new pathological mechanism
underlying autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and to test a new class of
therapeutic compounds in models of MS. The proposal is inspired by two lines of recent
discoveries: (i) in humans, several genome-wide association studies independently established
that c-Rel, the lymphoid and myeloid member of the Rel/nuclear factor-kB (Rel/NF-kB) family, is
a risk factor for six autoimmune diseases including MS; (ii) in mice, c-Rel deficiency renders them
resistant to autoimmune encephalomyelitis, arthritis, and colitis while having limited impact on
infections. We therefore theorized that c-Rel is both a risk factor and a pathogenic factor for
human autoimmune diseases and that drugs targeting it should be effective for treating the
diseases. To test this theory, we have developed a new class of small molecules that specifically
inhibits c-Rel function by preventing its binding to DNA. In mice, these compounds are highly
effective in suppressing autoimmune responses and in ameliorating ongoing experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model for MS. The specific goals of this proposal are
to elucidate the mechanism(s) through which c-Rel controls autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and
to test the theory that inhibition of c-Rel in both inflammatory and regulatory T cells is required to
cure autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Specifically, we will test the hypotheses that (i) c-Rel serves
as a transcriptional checkpoint of autoimmune encephalomyelitis; (ii) c-Rel controls autoimmune
encephalomyelitis in a cell- and gene-specific manner; and (iii) c-Rel blockade diminishes anti-
myelin immune responses of multiple sclerosis patients."

 Social interactions are critical to the physical and emotional health of a wide variety of species.
Perturbations in social functioning, a hallmark symptom of many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders
such as autism and schizophrenia, can profoundly impair an individual’s ability to sustain healthy social relations.
While a growing body of literature has elucidated neural circuits for dyadic social interactions (interactions
between two individuals), our understanding of higher order interactions at the level of larger groups is
remarkably weak. Humans and other species organize themselves into social groups, in which the behavior of
each individual both contributes to and benefits from the cohesiveness and well-being of the collective. Social
groups serve as a context for sharing of resources, buffering of stress, regulation of homeostatic needs, and a
reservoir of cognitive capacity to solve problems and respond to environmental challenges. In order to address
this gap in the literature, I am using a novel behavioral approach to study how groups of mice self-organize into
huddles in response to a cold temperature thermal challenge. Prior studies examining social groups have been
limited by lack of technology to track the pose and identity of each mouse over the duration of a session. To
address these challenges, I am using novel multi-animal pose estimation tools developed through computer
vision to quantitatively identify huddling configurations in groups of four mice. Furthermore, I am combining this
automated behavioral tracking with circuit dissection tools to understand which circuits in the brain coordinate
huddling in response to thermal challenge. Published work from our lab and others suggests that medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a critical node involved in regulating group level behaviors and inter-brain dynamics
across species. However, the contribution of mPFC and its descending projections to group huddling has never
been explored. Furthermore, although whole-brain knockout studies have found that the social hormone oxytocin
is necessary for huddling in mice, the precise neural circuits that are engaged by oxytocin to promote huddling
never been examined. The experiments described in this proposal will fill a critical gap in our understanding of
neural mechanisms for collective behavior by performing detailed quantitative behavioral analysis and neural
circuit dissection to physiologically observe, computationally model, and functionally manipulate individual
descending projections of the dmPFC during huddling. Using an ethologically relevant group behavior, in vivo
freely moving calcium imaging, chemogenetic manipulations, and anatomical mapping, the proposed study will
test the hypothesis that oxytocin engages discrete, anatomically-defined pathways descending from the dmPFC
to promote group huddling. These results will set the foundation for a more incisive analysis of how dmPFC
circuits shape social function in both health and disease. In addition, completion of this work will provide critical
training in statistical and machine learning approaches to study the behavior and neural dynamics of social
groups, which are essential for the candidate to become a successful independent investigator."

Early Childhood Caries (ECC), though preventable is the second most common chronic disease of childhood.
Recently, digital health has attracted substantial interest from the government particularly in low-middle-income
countries (LMIC) where mobile communication and telehealth has opened new possibilities for overcoming the
geographical inaccessibility of health care. Our preliminary work at the Centre for Early Childhood Caries
Research (CECCRe) using telephone calls, text messages, and providing age-appropriate infant oral care aids
collectively called Sustained Anticipatory Guidance (SAG) has shown promising results in infants with cleft lip
and palate recruited at pre dentate stage in preventing ECC. The feasibility and success of SAG have led to
ECC prevention up to 94%. We, therefore, propose to develop, validate, and test a novel approach of using a
mobile app to provide age-appropriate SAG to the parents. This approach is fundamentally different from the
traditional method of providing anticipatory guidance (AG) at the 6-monthly recall visits. In the R21 phase, we
will develop and test an interactive mobile app (Zero Cavity), grounded in Fisher Owen's model of children's
oral health determinants and the theory of planned behavior. Semi-structured interviews and focus group
discussion to explore awareness and practices and perceptions of oral health with relevant stakeholder groups
of parents, pediatricians and dentists and develop tailored guidance to the infant!s age and specific state of
oral development. We will use Design Thinking, 5De approach, and Nielsen Norman Guidelines to develop the
Zero cavity app prototype. In Aim 2, we will pilot test the Android and iOS versions of the app and evaluate
user perception using uMARS, CALO-RE scales. The R33 phase will be undertaken after the successful
completion of the R21 milestones. In Aim 3, we will establish 540 mother-child dyads and using an intent-to-
treat analysis to determine the effect of mobile app-assisted SAG protocol delivered through the Zero Cavity
app. Both intervention and control groups will receive baseline AG at the initial visit and at in-person 6-monthly
recalls. In addition, intervention group will receive SAG through the Zero cavity app between the in-person
visits. The trial will be carried out after registration in Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI) and adhering to
CONSORT guidelines. The R33 phase will culminate with an evaluation of effectiveness of the Zero Cavity app
in delivering SAG to mothers/fathers, thereby, preventing ECC. The secondary outcome (occurrence of ECC)
will be measured using International Caries Detection and Assessment System (ICDAS) by calibrated
examiners at 6 monthly intervals. The overall goal of this study is to develop, validate and test an interactive
mobile app (Zero Cavity) to deliver SAG to parents leading to a scalable cost-effective intervention preventing
ECC in LMIC countries."
10744258,"SUMMARY – DEVELOPMENT CORE
The overall goal of the Development Core DC of the center for Children's Health Assessment, Research
Translation, and Combating Environmental Racism (CHARTER) is to provide a comprehensive, integrated
program of career development to enhance the path towards independence for early-stage investigators working
in the thematic areas of children's environmental health, health disparities, and translation of research affecting
Black individuals and their communities. The lack of progress in addressing environmental racism and health
disparities can be attributed, in part, to inadequate capacity building in research and translation at the intersection
of the fields of environmental and maternal-child health and community advocacy, including limited funding and
career development opportunities for junior scientists, particularly those who have been structurally marginalized
resulting in their underrepresentation. The Development Core will serve a pivotal role in developing early-stage
investigators and promoting research, research capacity building, and translation in the intersection of the fields
of children's environmental health, health disparities, and research translation to generate innovative approaches
to mitigate environmental health disparities and improve access to healthy environments for Black women,
children, and communities. The Development Core will be led by three experienced environmental health
researchers with extensive expertise in children's environmental health research, and who will engage with
multidisciplinary faculty across Emory University and the University of Georgia to administer a comprehensive
program to train and advance the career trajectory of early stage investigators, with a focus on underrepresented
minorities. The Development Core will accomplish its mission by (1) organizing and administering a multi-level
Pilot Project Program to provide opportunities to support innovative, time-sensitive projects and preliminary data
generation opportunities with priority given to early stage investigators, particularly Underrepresented Minorities
(URMs), to enhance their research in translational environmental health disparities and children's environmental
health research; (2) cultivate a CHARTER Investigator career development program; and (3) provide
opportunities for mentoring, research guidance and career development support for early stage investigators
and trainees through seminars, workshops, and networking opportunities. By offering innovative program and
services, the Development Core of CHARTER, will impact the career trajectories of new and early career
researchers, particularly those that have been historically structurally marginalized, fortifying their success in
obtaining independent research funding, developing skills to promote career success, and build networks of
collaborators and mentors that can assure long-term success in children's environmental health research."
10744260,"TRANSLATIONAL CORE - ABSTRACT
The Translational Core (TC) will be the primary focus of the Center and support scientists, community
members, and healthcare providers in generating and disseminating critical research findings in children's
environmental health to raise awareness of exposure risks and encourage meaningful actions for risk
mitigation, equitably across communities. The TC addresses the historical challenges of bridging the gap of the
generation of new scientific knowledge into high-impact messages that promote and sustain long-lasting
change among individuals, families, healthcare providers. Building on the scientific knowledge being generated
by Emory researchers specifically on the environmental health issues of inner city AA families and young
children, the TC will focus on accelerating the translation of these findings to public health and clinical practice
with a primary focus on underserved communities in the Atlanta area who may be inadvertently subject to
environmental injustice. To maximize the public health impact of our translational efforts, the TC will 1)
leverage the storytelling power of virtual reality (VR), 2) harness the ability of communication platforms to
socially connect users across physical distances, and 3) design messages with environmental health literacy
practices in mind so that the communication is clearly understandable and accessible to target audiences. This
effort will be led by Dr. Sun Joo Ahn, TC Lead and director of the Games and Virtual Environments Lab at the
University of Georgia, where she specializes in designing and evaluating interactive media messages to
promote health behaviors. She will be joined by Dr. Ruth Parker, a leading national expert on research,
education, and policy efforts to advance our nation's health literacy. The TC will be advised by the Community
Cabinet of the Administrative Core, including Dr. Na'Taki Osborne Jelks of Spelman University, a nationally-
recognized leader in engaging urban communities and youth in environmental stewardship. This translational
team will also collaborate with the Region 4 Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units and the substantial
engagement with Atlanta communities and health providers to further the aims of this core. With this expertise
in environmental health, communication science, health literacy, and community engagement, the TC will work
closely with CEH researchers to develop innovative and efficacious communication strategies to support and
expand the capacity of individuals and communities to apply critical CEH findings in their lives."
10744261,"NATIONAL COORDINATING CENTER - ABSTRACT
The Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN), through partnership with Emory's CHARTER center,
proposes to serve as the CEHRT National Coordinating Center (NCC). CEHN is a national organization with
nearly 30 years of experience leading the field of children's environmental health across sectors. Its
commitment to supporting, synthesizing, and sharing rigorous independent science, its long history of
convening diverse audiences, and the trust that it has earned among communities and stakeholders, positions
CEHN well to act as the national CEHRT hub for collecting, sharing, and exchanging CEH knowledge. CEHN
will work collaboratively with NIEHS, the funded CEHRT Centers, and Sharecare, Inc. (a leading US digital
health company) to advance the overall goals of the CEHRT Program and leverage the collective science into
meaningful action for the public. A steering committee will be formed to guide the functions of the NCC and to
assure that the Core is outward facing and inclusive of external CEH stakeholders. An advanced digital hub will
be established to integrate and optimally disseminate the work of each of the funded Centers, NIEHS, CEHN,
and Sharecare. Sharecare's ability to quickly produce diverse media will help to ensure that the work of each
Center is optimally represented within the hub; the company's dissemination channels (email, social, app, etc.),
combined with the dissemination channels of CEHN, NIEHS, and the CEHRT Centers, will ensure that
messages are dynamically and strategically shared with national audiences. Once the web infrastructure is
formed, the NCC will leverage the hub's assets and interconnectivity to coordinate and streamline initiatives
across the CEHRT network. In addition, CEHN will provide: efficient coordination of CEHRT Network activities
and meetings; a needed face fielding public inquiries about the program and directing people to appropriate
resources; and visibility to diverse stakeholders via targeted presentations. CEHN will partner with Sharecare
to integrate children's environmental health content from the CEHRT Network and beyond into their digital
platform for broad reach into their market. CEHN will collect the following: 1) Metrics on CEH engagement, 2)
Data on health actions/outcomes that can be traced to CEHRT messaging, and 3) Interpersonal insights about
the effectiveness of community implementation efforts. These insights will be applied to continuously refine
NCC strategies and precisely market initiatives."
10931667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 1.7 million core needle breast biopsies are performed in the U.S. every year among women with either a
palpable mass or a suspicious finding on breast imaging.1 Benign breast disease is diagnosed in 75% of these
biopsies2 and comprises a spectrum of diagnoses ranging from normal or non-proliferative changes to
proliferative changes with or without atypical features. Early studies demonstrated that ~10-30% of women with
specific benign breast disease diagnoses (referred to as “high-risk lesions”) had cancer identified on surgical
excision of their lesion (referred to as “upgrade”).3,4 Thus, aggressive management with surgical excision is
common for these high-risk lesions to rule out malignancy.1 However, there is widespread interest in avoiding
surgery for high-risk lesions, the majority of which will not yield a malignant diagnosis on excision.5 Single-
institution studies have identified various patient, pathologic, and radiologic variables associated with risk of
upgrade on excision, but insufficient evidence is available to inform evidence-based guidelines as to which
patients with high-risk lesions can safely avoid excision.5-7 There is also uncertainty about long-term breast
cancer risk and the need for enhanced prevention and detection strategies among women who do not undergo
excision, or who undergo excision without upgrade.8-10 Our goal is to provide definitive new evidence to guide
clinical management recommendations for high-risk breast lesions. We propose a comprehensive study
leveraging the rich infrastructure and longitudinal data of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, a large
U.S. alliance of breast imaging and pathology registries. We will supplement the existing BCSC database with
newly collected data from breast imaging reports, pathology reports, and other clinical medical records for over
7,000 high-risk lesions diagnosed at more than 100 healthcare facilities since 2010. Using an ensemble
learning approach we will develop and validate prediction models for risk of upgrade on excision (Aim 1) and 5-
year breast cancer incidence among women with high-risk lesions (Aim 2) based on patient, pathologic, and
radiologic factors. In Aim 3 we will use a decision analysis framework paired with qualitative study of
stakeholder perspectives to evaluate the potential population impact and acceptability of risk-based strategies
for managing high-risk lesions. Our results will facilitate identification of women with acceptably low risk of
upgrade on excision who can be safely managed by imaging surveillance, and identify women with elevated
risk of a future cancer diagnosis who need enhanced long-term imaging surveillance and/or chemoprevention.
The proposed study will be far larger and more representative of clinical practice in the U.S. than any study
conducted to date, and will be the first to comprehensively evaluate patient, biopsy, pathologic, and radiologic
factors in relation to high-risk lesion outcomes in a multicenter study. Evidence generated by this study will
inform clinical recommendations for the management of high-risk lesions diagnosed with core needle biopsy,
resulting in improved care and reduced harms for the >100,000 women diagnosed annually in the U.S."
10903875,"Premature aging syndromes in laminopathies caused by mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding nuclear
envelope protein lamin A/C (LMNA), are the prototypic examples of genomic instability, which is a hallmark of
“normal” aging. Cardiovascular involvement is the cardinal phenotype and the major cause of mortality and
morbidity. The pathogenesis of laminopathies and “normal” aging share several common mechanisms. LMNA
regulates mitochondrial function, telomere length, nutrient sensing, stem cell regeneration, and autophagy, which
are the classic hallmarks of “normal aging”. LMNA expression is reduced in “normal” aging. A similar set of
nuclear defects are observed in “normal” aging and laminopathies. LMNA also regulates several epigenetic
regulators of aging, including sirtuins and histone deacetylases. Furthermore, LMNA is essential for genomic
instability and induction and repair of the double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) as well as the mechanical integrity
of the nuclear membrane. These mechanisms are also the core mechanisms of “normal” aging.
 We have shown that the cytosolic DNA (CyDNA)-sensing proteins CGAS/STING1 are induced and their
downstream effectors TBK1, IRF3, and NFKB are activated, and the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) is expressed in the human hearts and mouse models of laminopathies. We also have
identified and defined the LMNA-associated domains (LADs) in human cardiac myocytes (CMs) and have shown
that LADs are shifted in laminopathies and regulate CpG methylation and gene expression. Moreover, we have
identified 711 DSBs (q<0.05) in the nDNA in the LMNA-deficient as compared to the wild-type (WT) CMs by
END-Sequencing (END-Seq). DSBs show a preponderance toward the protein-coding genes, which is consistent
with the role of the LMNA in defining the boundaries of TADs and TOP2B processing. Furthermore, we have
shown that deletion of the Mb21l1 gene, encoding CGAS, attenuates the phenotype in a mouse model of cardiac
laminopathies. Therefore, we logic that studying premature aging in laminopathies would provide insights into
the mechanisms that are shared with “normal” aging. The large effect sizes of the LMNA mutations would provide
a better resolution in discerning the deranged hallmarks of aging than the “normal” aging, whereby numerous
determinants, each with a small effect size, interact stochastically to induce aging. Thus, we propose to identify
and characterize the genome-wide DSBs in CMs, cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), and endothelial cells (ECs) in
laminopathies and the old WT mice by END-Seq, the former because of the involvement of multiple cell types in
laminopathies and the latter to assess the extension of the findings in laminopathies to “normal” aging. Likewise,
we propose to identify and characterize the sources of the CyDNA in CMs, CFs, and ECs in laminopathies by
CGAS ChIP-Seq. Moreover, we propose to determine the effects of genetic blockade of the STING1 on selected
hallmarks of aging and cardiac phenotype in laminopathies. The findings are expected to provide insights into
the molecular basis of premature CV aging in laminopathies and likely the hallmarks of “normal” aging."

The retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) is an amitotic, long-lived cell type that supports healthy visual function
for numerous decades. The aging retina displays pathologic features that are exaggerated in a complex disease
called age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Progressive degeneration of the aging RPE is a hallmark of
geographic atrophy, a late-stage of AMD that causes vision loss. We recently discovered an excess abundance
of cytosolic complementary DNA derived from the SINE retrotransposon element (RTE) Alu family in the RPE of
human eyes with geographic atrophy and that cytosolic Alu cDNAs are highly cytotoxic to the RPE in animal and
human cell-based studies. These Alu cDNAs are produced via reverse transcription of Alu RNAs by the long-
interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1). We also found that Alu cDNAs trigger the cytosolic escape of mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA), and together these two cytosolic DNAs collaborate, in mechanistically unclear ways, to activate
a multifaceted innate immune response that results in cell death. To gain a better understanding of the
combinatory impact of Alu cDNAs and mtDNA and their causal contribution to aging in the retina, we will (1)
create temporal, spatial, and sequence topographic maps of Alu cDNA subfamilies and mtDNA in young, healthy
aged, and AMD-affected human eyes; (2) probe the stimuli for and mechanisms of Alu cDNA generation in aging
by investigating whether L1 regulators influence Alu cDNA production and retinal toxicity; and (3) elucidate the
pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by Alu cDNA and the noncanonical inflammatory pathways
triggered by Alu cDNA and mtDNA joint activity that are responsible for retinal cell death. This proposal is
responsive to RFA-AG-23-015 as it will provide mechanistic insights into how cytosolic Alu cDNAs and mtDNA
mediate interactions of aging hallmarks and modulate healthspan by mapping their sequence and expression
during aging, determining the regulation of their biogenesis, and delineating how they conspire with each other
to promote cellular dysfunction in aging. Completion of these studies will reveal previously unexplored pathways
with therapeutic relevance for developing transformative therapies to improve visual healthspan and potentially
cognitive healthspan, as conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease share epidemiological and mechanistic features
with AMD."

Lethal small molecules are powerful tools to discover and characterize new cell death
mechanisms that may be useful for cancer treatment. Using small molecules, we have identified
an unconventional form of non-apoptotic cell death that is distinct from apoptosis, ferroptosis,
and other known forms of cell death. This lethal mechanism requires protein palmitoylation and
involves the disruption of protein trafficking. In this research we propose to test the role of lipid
metabolic enzymes that may positively or negatively regulate palmoptosis. One Aim of this
research will focus on the lipid metabolic enzyme TECR (trans-2,3-enoyl-CoA reductase). We
will test the hypothesis that TECR synthesizes palmitate that is used by protein palmitoylation
enzymes to drive cell death via altered protein trafficking. A second Aim of this research will test
the hypothesis that cell death is triggered by the disruption of phosphatidylcholine metabolism,
which alters protein trafficking. A third Aim of this research will test the hypothesis that this new
cell death mechanism can be activated in genetically engineered mouse models of cancer by a
clinical drug candidate. While this cell death mechanism can be activated in diverse cancers, a
major focus of the proposed studies is on sarcoma, which is highly sensitive to this lethal
mechanism and for which new treatments are urgently needed. Together, these studies will
define a new form of cell death and associated biochemical mechanisms that may be exploited
for the treatment of sarcoma and other cancers."

Screening for prostate cancer (PCa) is highly controversial, as accumulated evidence indicates that widespread,
routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening reduces PCa mortality but at the cost of significant over-
diagnosis and over-treatment. PSA-based risk-stratified screening could capture much of the benefit of screening
while greatly reducing over-diagnosis. This promising approach uses men’s baseline PSA values to inform their
risk of future aggressive and/or fatal PCa and determine their frequency of further screening. Under this
approach, men with high baseline age-specific total PSA levels receive more frequent screening and men with
lower levels receive less frequent screening. This efficient approach is currently supported by at least three US
advisory agencies, but not by several others, including most notably, the US Preventive Services Task Force.
This agency recommends additional “validation studies” with “longer-term follow-up” before considering PSA-
based risk-stratified screening. Additional data are also needed to optimize each of the components of PSA-
based risk-stratified screening, including the: (1) age at which baseline PSA values should be obtained, (2) length
of tailored re-screening intervals, (3) tailored age at screening cessation, (4) tailored strategies for Black men,
as these men are at higher risk of aggressive and fatal PCa, yet remarkably under-represented in the screening
literature, and (5) prostate-specific kallikreins used for screening, as kallikreins beyond total PSA have also been
found to predict PCa risk and mortality and thus might help to optimize PSA-based risk-stratified screening.
Therefore, to address each of these gaps, we propose to leverage data and serum specimens collected in the
large racially-diverse Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated health system, along with its long-
running (over 5 decades), embedded Multiphasic Health Checkups cohort and nested case-cohort to: (1)
evaluate the utility of initiating baseline PSA screening before age 50, (2) determine the optimal re-screening
interval after a baseline PSA test, (3) identify populations of men at age 60 who might consider stopping
screening, (4) explore whether Black men should initiate screening earlier and be screened more frequently than
White men, and (5) evaluate whether adding other prostate-specific kallikreins to total PSA enhances prediction
of clinically-relevant PCa. Our overall goal is to provide evidence for “smarter” or more nuanced PSA screening
strategies to preserve or enhance the mortality benefits of PSA screening, while greatly minimizing its harms
and costs."

The motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) are frequently treated with dopamine replacement therapies,
such as the dopamine precursor levodopa or dopamine receptor agonists. While very effective for some of the
cardinal motor features, these medications can cause two major complications: levodopa-induced dyskinesia
(LID) and impulse control disorder (ICD). LID consists of drug-induced abnormal involuntary movements, and is
closely associated with levodopa. ICD manifests as a syndrome of impulsive and/or compulsive behaviors, such
as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, or binge eating, and is closely associated with dopamine D2/3R
agonists. Little is known about the synaptic or circuit mechanisms of either disorder, though substantial progress
has been made on LID through the use of animal models of PD/LID. In our prior work, we have found that a
subset of striatal direct pathway medium spiny neurons achieve high levodopa-evoked firing rates in vivo, which
correlate with and cause dyskinesia in the mouse model. Other intermingled direct pathway neurons correlate
with the therapeutic effects of levodopa. We have also recently developed a mouse model of PD/ICD, based on
a delay discounting task and administration of the dopamine agonist pramipexole, which will permit more
mechanistic studies. In this proposal we will explore some cellular and circuit mechanisms of LID and ICD, using
in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in mouse models. This proposal aims
to (1) test whether local striatal inhibitory synapses are altered in and contribute to LID, (2) determine whether
extrinsic inhibitory synapses from the globus pallidus to the striatum are altered in and contribute to LID, and (3)
begin to explore the striatal mechanisms of ICD. These studies will build on our prior work in LID to unravel its
cellular mechanisms, but also determine if ICD is mediated by similar or distinct processes. Together, these

10896202,"This proposal is a new application for a Bridges to the Baccalaureate Degree (BS) T34 Program (Opportunity
number PAR-22-125) at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), Las Cruces. The program proposes to
serve American Indian (AI) and Hispanic students at two community colleges. These institutions combined
have an enrollment of 4293 AI students and 10,699 Hispanic students (data from academic year 2021-22).
The community colleges are composed of two state-supported community colleges: Dona Ana Community
College and San Juan College in Farmington, NM. Funding for 5 years is requested for programmatic
activities that attract, enrich, enhance preparedness, and advance AI and Hispanic students into
baccalaureate degree programs aligned with the biomedical sciences. The annual goals of this application
are: (i) A series of recruitment/informational workshops will be organized and conducted at the community
colleges by the resident community college partner MPIs. This will introduce >100 AI and Hispanic health
and science majors to research career opportunities in biomedicine and biomedical-related research at
NMSU. (ii) From the student pool in goal (i), 10-15 pre-admitted trainees will visit the NMSU campus each
spring for a one-two day orientation program to prepare for forthcoming summer research experiences. (iii)
From the student pool of goal (ii), 10 trainees will conduct fulltime research with a faculty mentor and
participate in many structured enrichment workshops during 9-10 summer weeks at the campus of NMSU.
Workshops will include: enhancement of computer skills for conducting research and preparing a scientific
poster; discussions of ethical conduct of research; comprehensive laboratory safety training; development of
scientific writing and presentation skills; instruction in reproducibility; academic transfer advisement; and,
financial planning for completion of the B.S. degree; (iv) NMSU research-intensive faculty will serve as
summer research preceptors and as research advisors after students transfer to a BS program at NMSU. (v)
This application proposes to transfer 65% of its summer research participants to BS institutions and to
graduate 65% of the transferees with a BS degree. (vi) The NMSU B2B program will support trainees who
have transferred to NMSU until another appropriate NMSU undergraduate training program (such as MARC)
can accept and further support the trainee. The previous NMSU R25 Bridge Program (2006-2022) has
produced 58 almost exclusively American Indian baccalaureate degrees."
10912709,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over the next 5 years, NanoSMS will be developed into a technology which offers the first look
into the single cell secretome; with single molecule sensitivity. The development of this new
technology is based on the integration of single cell encapsulation technologies with nanopore-
based single molecule sensing. The collection of molecules released into the extracellular
environment by single cells, termed the single cell secretome, offers a unique glimpse into the
complexities of cellular life and cell-to-cell communication. The key features of the technology
which will be developed at the end of the project period include (1) a massively parallel way to
form droplets adhered onto a glass slide and containing a single cell, and (2) a nanopore-based
approach for measuring secreted molecule originating from a single cell. Once the nanopores and
related methodologies are developed, we aim to answer four key questions surrounding important
biomedical issues. First, the nanopore will quantify single cell antibody production originating
from human plasma cells which have been isolated from patients in various disease states
including auto-immune disorders. Second, B cells and T cells will be co-incubated and stimulated
with a single antigen to induce an immune response. The time lag to start generating antibodies
as well as the factors which influence the timing of the immune response will be studied. Third,
eosinophils co-incubated with a single cancer cell (or cancer-derived vesicles) will be investigated
to provide insight into early cancer recognition mechanisms. Lastly, single cell secretome
fingerprinting will be used to access the ability to discriminate between stem cell lineages in a
non-destructive manner. Stem cell characterization is important for cell therapy (in which the
mechanism of action is secreted molecules) as well as assessing cell state for regenerative
medicine. Needless to say, the secretome plays a functional and yet obscured role in both normal
and diseased cellular states. The application of NanoSMS (a nanopore-based approach towards
secretome analysis) will provide a unique and new tool for single cell characterization."

Aging is the greatest risk factor for most chronic illnesses, and the interdisciplinary field of geroscience aims to
understand the mechanisms of biological aging that impact the development of such age-associated and
chronic diseases. While this concept has gained traction in some graduate programs affiliated with medical
schools, geroscience is not well recognized or represented at the undergraduate level. To address the need
for growing the geroscience workforce, the long-term goal of this education program is to increase the quantity
and quality of new geroscience investigators by providing teaching and training to the most foundational
population for strengthening the geroscientist pipeline – undergraduate students. NIA support will enable our
creation of an undergraduate Education in Aging and Geroscience Research (EAGR) program. It is designed
to support educational and research activities for undergraduates that will advance both basic and translational
aspects of geroscience. Our EAGR program will be implemented through the execution of 5 synergistic Aims:
(1) Create a geroscience coursework curriculum for training undergraduate students in the biological bases of
aging and fundamentals of aging research; (2) Establish a research program for undergraduate students to
gain hands-on experience in laboratories studying geroscience and the pillars/hallmarks of aging; (3) Promote
career development and scientific communication activities that expedite student admission into graduate
programs and identification of geroscience PhD labs; (4) Enhance the diversity of student researchers entering
the geroscience field; (5) Disseminate course materials and research findings to the geroscience community
and improve the public understanding of geroscience. By seeding the field of aging with new researchers and
sharing the procedural aspects of the EAGR program, we hope to impact geroscience for many years to come."
10925302,"Engineered T cells that express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have shown remarkable efficacy against
hematological malignancies. However, broad implementation of CAR T cell therapies is limited by the lengthy
(3–5 weeks) and costly ($350K–450K per treatment) ex vivo manufacturing pipeline. This proposal seeks to
develop antigen-presenting nanoparticles (APNs) for in situ programming of virus-specific T cells for rapid and
cost-efficient CAR T cell manufacturing. Virus-specific T cells present a promising opportunity to enhance CAR
T cell therapy, as they have improved persistence and proliferation potential, and allow for viral vaccination to
augment CAR therapy through their endogenous receptors. This proposal will focus on influenza A virus (IAV)-
specific T cells to exploit the existing seasonal influenza vaccination to boost CAR activities. To deliver CAR to
IAV-specific T cells, APNs will comprise lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that encapsulate CAR-encoded mRNA and
are decorated with HLA-A peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) displaying influenza peptide
epitopes. This proposal will use APNs to deliver human B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR in the context of
multiple myeloma with future goals to expand to other CAR specificities and indications, including CD19 positive
cancers. The goal in Aim 1 is to develop APNs for transfection of human influenza-specific T cells with αBCMA
CAR in vivo, and characterize the CAR transfection specificity in the target IAV-specific T cells versus other
major cell populations. Aim 2 will be focused on validating the anti-cancer efficacy of αBCMA CAR T cells after
in situ transfection using a mouse model recapitulating human multiple myeloma. The vaccination strategy to
expand IAV-specific T cells and to boost their effector functions will be tested using inactivated influenza virions
to vaccinate the CAR-expressing, IAV-specific T cells and compare the resulting anti-cancer potency with the
unvaccinated cohort. In Aim 3, CRISPR/Cas9 will be implemented with APNs for in vivo gene editing of T cells
with CAR for durable CAR expression and enhanced anti-cancer potency by delaying T-cell differentiation and
exhaustion. The success of this proposal will challenge existing paradigms of T cell engineering, reduce the cost
of CAR T cell therapy, and enhance anti-cancer activity through influenza vaccination to ultimately democratize
CAR T cells for cancer therapy. Through this work, the candidate will close the knowledge gaps by the
mentorship of an exceptional advisory committee: (1) Gabe Kwong, Ph.D. (CAR T cell engineering), (2) Phil
Santangelo, Ph.D. (mRNA therapeutics and CRISPR/Cas), (3) Rafi Ahmed, Ph.D. (anti-viral T cell immunity and
memory/exhaustion T cell biology), and (4) Madhav Dhodapkar, M.D. (hematology/oncology and myeloma
cancer models). This strong mentoring team and the abundant resources provided by Georgia Tech and Emory
University constitute a fertile mentoring environment for attaining the candidate's career goal of leading an
independent research program focused on developing new technologies to improve patient access and
treatment outcome of T-cell immunotherapy against cancer."
10879047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) emerge as early as preschool and are highly
persistent throughout childhood. Early and effective treatment can blunt the typical developmental progression
seen with ADHD. Despite the importance of early intervention, historically minoritized children are less likely to
be identified as needing supports, and less likely to receive appropriate treatment compared to white children.
This disproportionately in service delivery may place some children on negative long-term behavioral health
trajectories. To reduce this dramatic disparity in ADHD that is strongly associated with the trajectory of a child’s
future, it is critical that we identify malleable factors associated with eliminating ADHD disparities in preschool.
For preschoolers who display elevated ADHD symptoms, behavioral interventions are recommended as the
first line of treatment and are most effective when they target both parents and teachers. However, parents and
teachers experience barriers to implementing behavioral interventions with the recommended frequency and
fidelity with teachers frequently citing parents as barriers to adherence of behavioral interventions. In the
current study, we propose that the relationship between parents and teachers is a determinant of ADHD
outcomes by impacting the potency (and use) of behavioral interventions. Our overarching goal is to Discover,
Design, and Test a brief intervention to improve parent and teacher engagement in behavioral interventions for
preschoolers demonstrating elevated ADHD symptoms (Parent-Educator Action Response; PEAR). The
project will be conducted in 3 phases: 1) discover barriers to engaging in behavioral interventions among
parents and preschool educators as well as stakeholder-informed strategies to address these barriers through
an Innovation Tournament (Aim 1), (2) iteratively design and build PEAR to address identified barriers from
Aim 1 through a program development team and rapid prototyping (Aim 2), and (3) test the acceptability and
feasibility of PEAR in small-scale randomized controlled trial of the PEAR + behavioral intervention compared
to behavioral intervention only with 14 classrooms (42 parents and 14 educators of children aged 3-6 years old
with elevated ADHD symptoms; Aim 3). This K23 reflects the Notices of Special Interest in Diversity (NOT-OD-
20-31), NIMH Strategic Plan Goal 3 (Strive for Prevention and Cures), and the NIMH call to prevent or forestall
the emergence of ADHD in preschool (RFA-MH-21-230) by focusing on promoting parent and teacher
engagement in behavioral interventions to improve implementation, ultimately improving outcomes for
preschoolers from historically minoritized backgrounds with elevated ADHD symptoms. The research aims will
also serve as vehicles for pragmatic learning of the following training goals: 1) culturally humility, 2) expertise in
intervention development to reduce disparities, 3) advanced statistical modeling and measurement models for
social determinants research. This mentored K23 award will facilitate Dr. Zulauf-McCurdy’s long-term goal of
becoming an independent investigator with expertise in reducing mental health disparities in preschool."
10918186,"The Liang laboratory uses molecular simulations to fundamentally understand how electronically non-
adiabatic reactions couple with protein’s structure, dynamics, and function. Electronically non-adiabatic reactions,
such as photochemical and electron transfer reactions, switch electronic states during the chemical
transformation. A fundamental understanding of how they interact with proteins is essential for advances in
biomedical sciences. However, two central and fundamental questions remain elusive: (1) how does the protein
environment modulate the pathway, dynamics, and quantum yields of the non-adiabatic reactions? (2) how do
the non-adiabatic reactions induce structural changes in the protein? Molecular simulation is indispensable to
answering these questions because it can resolve the energetics and kinetics of chemical reactions at atomic-
level detail, which is often beyond the limit of current experimental techniques. Also, simulation incurs minimal
cost and has no risk for human subjects. However, the multiscale nature of these processes poses significant
challenges for traditional computational methods. Specifically, standard molecular mechanics (MM) simulations
cannot describe the quantum-mechanical (QM) nature of the non-adiabatic reactions. Meanwhile, typical QM
simulations are too expensive to characterize the slow biomolecular motions in response to these reactions.
 To overcome these challenges, in the next five years, our research program will expand our current efforts
to develop and employ multiscale simulation methods to understand (1) the light-regulated signaling activities of
transient receptor potential channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors by synthetic molecular switches,
which are of top interest in optogenetics and photopharmacology, and (2) the long-range electron transfer events
in cryptochromes and electron bifurcating enzymes, which are fundamental to understanding the circadian clocks,
magnetic field sensing and energy metabolism in living organisms. The unique advantages of our approaches
include (1) accurate and efficient non-adiabatic dynamics simulations with “on-the-fly” ab initio calculations of
nuclear gradients and electronic couplings; (2) effective integration of the high-quality non-adiabatic dynamics
simulations with high-efficiency MM sampling of protein conformational change. These key methodological
advantages will enable the comprehensive characterization of non-adiabatic chemical reactivity in complex
biomolecular systems and answer the above-mentioned fundamental questions with unprecedented accuracy.
Explicitly simulating the photodynamics of biomolecules of this size and complexity is not routine, especially
with the proposed multiscale simulation framework that incorporates ab initio non-adiabatic dynamics simulations.
Therefore, five years into the future, our research will provide new insights into the design principles of next-
generation photochemotherapy with minimal side effects, create powerful computational tools for simulating
electron transfer in biomolecules, and deepen our fundamental understanding of the roles of quantum mechanics
in biology in general."
10910140,"Probing the neural computations underlying goal-directed decision-making in humans with single-neuron
recordings
MPIs: Dr. John P. O’Doherty and Dr. Ueli Rutishauser
PROJECT SUMMARY
Flexible goal-directed decision-making is a core aspect of higher-order adaptive biological intelligence. A number
of psychiatric disorders involve impairments in goal-directed decision-making, yet the current lack of even a basic
understanding of how goal-directed action selection is implemented at the neuronal level in humans hinders our
ability to pinpoint these neuropsychiatric dysfunctions. In particular, it is completely unknown how goals, and the
stimuli and actions that need to be selected from in order to pursue them, are represented at the level of single
neurons, nor how goals get selected from available possible goals.
 Here we will characterize the functional contribution of human ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC), dorsal
anterior cingulate (dACC) and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) in these processes. We will first test the
longstanding proposal never tested at the neuronal level in humans that the value of stimuli is especially
represented by neurons in vmPFC, while the value of actions are more represented by neurons in dorsal cortical
areas such as the pre-SMA. We will then address how goals themselves are represented. In the real world,
animals including humans need to select a goal before any action is performed. Thus, there is a hierarchical
process of goal selection followed by action selection. We hypothesize that the vmPFC plays a specific role in
goal-valuation and selection, while neurons in dorsomedial areas including pre-SMA and dACC will play more of
a role in valuing and selecting the actions that implement the chosen goal. Most decision-making studies focus
either on action or stimulus selection, but don’t address how goals get selected in the first place. We will use
bespoke behavioral tasks to allow us to distinguish between these different goal and action-related computations
and analyze single neuron data simultaneously collected from these brain areas through the lens of
computational reinforcement-learning models. The significance of this proposal is that we will gain for the first
time, a comprehensive understanding of the functions of the human PFC in goal-directed decision-making at
cellular resolution while shedding light on the neural mechanisms of goal-representation and selection which
hitherto has been virtually unstudied. Consequently, the proposed project is highly significant in terms of the
potential impact that will be made toward understanding the distinct role of different human PFC subregions in
goal-directed decision-making."
10861037,"ABSTRACT
High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. Patients with increased
risk of ovarian cancer due to inherited syndromes–most notably carriers of pathogenic variants of
BRCA1/BRCA2–are recommended to undergo prophylactic risk reducing salpingo-oophorectomies (RRSO)
because there is no effective ovarian cancer surveillance. Despite undergoing surgical removal of ovaries and
fallopian tubes, 10-20% of patients will experience primary peritoneal cancer, an ovarian cancer related
malignancy. As such there is a dire need to understand the early events in HGSC development to improve
therapeutic decisions for high-risk patients. Importantly, a recent study found that the presence of serous tubal
intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC) at RRSO was associated with 10.5% risk of developing primary peritoneal
carcinoma (PPC) compared with a 0.3% risk in patients with normal fallopian tube histology at the time of surgery.
HGSC is characterized by high rates of genomic instability arising from ongoing chromosome missegregation
due to defective mitotic machinery or errors in DNA repair and replication. We hypothesize that genomic
instability is a critical event in the transition between STIC and invasive HGSC, endowing cancer cells
with karyotypic diversity needed for invasion and immune evasion. We will investigate this hypothesis by
1) Quantifying cGAS, a marker for cytosolic DNA, in fixed patient samples as a biomarker for chromosomal
instability. 2) Interrogating disruption of the local immune microenvironment in STIC and HGSC as a function of
aneuploidy 3) Quantifying rates of aneuploidy in single cells as a marker for early transformation and 4)
Integrating the molecular and imaging markers to identify and validate features associated with invasive STICs.
An understanding of the processes that mediate the transition between non-invasive STIC to invasive HGSC will
lay the groundwork for discovery of early detection markers. Moreover, as genetic testing increases and identifies
high-risk patients for RRSOs and even normal risk patients more often undergo opportunistic salpingectomies,
it is likely we will identify patients with STICs. This project will allow us to focus on patients with evidence of
genomically unstable STICs who may be at a greater risk to develop subsequent PPC and thus may require
closer surveillance and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Moreover, the FFPE tolerant scWGS technology developed
as part of this proposal will allow us to interrogate the timing of genomic instability and clonal relationships
between STIC and HGSC. This will fundamentally enhance our understanding of the events in ovarian cancer
initiation and lays the foundation to further improve early detection of HGSC in patients."

African American (AA) bladder cancer (BLCA) patients have worse survival and oncologic outcomes compared
to their European American (EA) counterparts. We contend that the lower survival of AA patients is driven in
part by altered tumor-specific biological activities. We have identified through mass spectrometry, genome-wide
transcriptomics, and functional biology in ancestry-verified cell lines and tumors from AA and EA BLCA patients
a pattern of mitochondrial dysregulation and immune activation disproportionately present in AA BLCA
patients. Based on this insight, we first characterized downstream metabolic changes and discovered that
mitochondrial complex I dysregulation was observed more frequently in AA BLCA patients and correlated with
more aggressive BLCA. In addition, targeted inhibition of complex I resulted in improved cancer outcomes in a
preclinical model. Moreover, we found that AA tumors containing increased complex I activity demonstrated a
higher glutamine flux into the TCA cycle by activation of GLS1, leading to accumulation of fatty acids via reductive
carboxylation. Furthermore, AA tumors with increased mitochondrial complex 1 activity showed enhanced
expression of the key complex I gene NDUFB8. Knockdown (KD) of NDUFB8 resulted in reduced mitochondrial
complex 1 activity, glutamine metabolism, ATP production, and regression of BLCA growth. Lastly, we found
that AA tumors with increased mitochondrial complex 1 activity also demonstrated concurrent activation of key
immune signaling pathways, including IFN signaling pathways, suggesting a potential interaction between tumor
metabolic activities and immune signaling. At the level of basic science, this project aims to identify the metabolic
and immunologic basis of BLCA disparities in AA patients by metabolomic analysis of the OXPHOS-GLS1
metabolic axis and by using cutting-edge single-cell RNA sequencing and imaging mass cytometry to profile the
tumor immune microenvironment and analyze tumor cell-immune cell interactions. At the translational level this
work will lay the foundation to test therapeutic strategies targeting complex 1 alone or in combination with GLS1
inhibitor in AA BLCA patients. If successful, these metabolic therapeutic strategies may be further combined with
immunotherapeutic interventions for AA BLCA patients."

The prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and vascular disease in an aging population is fueling a surge in chronic
skin wounds, which affect >8 million Medicare beneficiaries at a cost of >$96 billion per year. An estimated 2.5%
of US population is affected by chronic wounds. Diabetic ulcers (DU), complicated by infection/ischemia/high
reactive oxygen species, often suffer from poor perfusion. Reliance on VEGF therapy to improve perfusion
makes logical sense, yet clinical study outcomes fall far short of expectations. Possible factors limiting VEGF
therapy outcomes include insufficient local concentration of VEGF signaling partners and regression of immature
vessels. It is critically important to troubleshoot barriers and to establish a therapeutic regimen that delivers
desirable functional outcomes. To circumvent the low-efficiency hurdle of VEGF single-gene “monotherapy”,
development of “combined gene therapy” was initiated to deliver of two or more angiogenic molecules to
substantially enhance efficacy. Current literature presents compelling evidence recognizing a critical role of
active lipid mediators such as eicosanoids in enabling VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. However, the
implementation of VEGF therapy has not tested the significance of these lipid mediators as necessary adjuvant.
Recently we have reported that in diabetic ischemic skin endothelial cells, PLCγ2 levels remain low accounting
for diminished efficiency of VEGF therapy. However, the underlying mechanisms of such downregulation remain
unknown. Emerging evidence demonstrate that hyperglycemia leads to DNA methylation and epigenetic
silencing in the complex interplay between genes and the environment in DU subjects. In addition to endothelium,
PLCγ2 enables macrophage function via TREM2 signaling. TREM2+ macrophages participate in tissue
angiogenesis post-injury. The central hypothesis is that hyperglycemia dependent loss of vascular PLCγ2–
myeloid TREM2 crosstalk compromises VEGF-induced increase in diabetic wound-edge vascularization. Gene
targeted DNA demethylation has potential to rescue PLCγ2 gene expression. The proposed line of work is the
first to study CRISPR/dCas9-based in vivo targeted epigenetic editing of dermal endothelial cells as a therapeutic
intervention for enabling VEGF therapy. Three aims are proposed: Aim 1. Determine the epigenetic mechanisms
underlying PLCγ2 regulation of VEGF signaling under hyperglycemic conditions. Aim 2. Elucidate the molecular
mechanisms by which PLCγ2 regulates wound tissue vascularization. Aim 3. Evaluate the functional significance
of endothelial-targeted PLCγ2 augmentation in vascular-myeloid crosstalk as it relates to diabetic wound
vascularization. The proposed research will unveil the critical role of PLCγ2 and the impact of this important
element in VEGF signaling to help improve the efficiency and robustness of vasculogenic VEGF therapy in
diabetic wound healing."

Although previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of initiating medications for opioid use disorder
(MOUDs) during incarceration, there has been very little adoption nationwide of this practice. Extended-release
buprenorphine (XR-B) is a promising intervention for the treatment of OUDs in carceral settings. Individuals
with OUDs re-entering the community are at an elevated risk for overdose and death from relapse to opioid
use among other opioid-related harms. This proposal builds on the current investigators experience conducting
clinical trials using both XR-B and sublingual-buprenorphine-naloxone (SL-B) with individuals in jail and prison.
This proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of XR-B vs. SL-B in a large metropolitan jail. An open-label
design will randomly assign 240 adults with moderate-to-severe OUDs who are soon-to-be-released from jail to
either XR-B (n = 120) or SL-B (n = 120) treatment in jail followed by 6-months of post-release buprenorphine
treatment, a 7-month safety visit, and final long-term follow-up at 12-months. The study has three aims: Aim 1.
Compare the effectiveness of XR-B vs. SL-B in terms of: Primary Outcome. (a) illicit opioid use (i. urine
toxicology; ii. self-reported days of opioid use using Timeline Followback; and iii. time to opioid relapse).
Secondary Outcomes. (b) retention in buprenorphine treatment (i. days receiving buprenorphine and ii. time to
treatment dropout); (c) other illicit substance use (i. urine toxicology; ii. self-reported days of illicit substance
use using Timeline Followback; (d) overdose events (non-fatal and fatal); (e) quality of life (i. physical health; ii.
mental health); (f) HIV risk behaviors (i. sexual risk behavior; ii. needle use or sharing); and (g) criminal activity
(i. crime days; ii. re-arrest; iii. technical violations; iv. re-incarceration). Aim 2. To calculate the cost to the state
and/or jail/city health system of implementing XR-B and SL-B, and determine the relative value, including the
costs associated with the interventions in the community, from a county and state-policymaker and societal
perspective. Aim 3. Explore barriers and facilitators to XR-B/SL-B implementation in jail: (1) dose induction; (2)
diversion and procedures for reducing diversion; (3) continuity of care after release or transfer to another
facility; (4) staffing (both custody and medical) needs for daily versus XR-B buprenorphine dosing; and (5)
patient preference for XR-B versus SL-B. The proposed study would be innovative because it would be the first
large scale RCT in the US assessing effectiveness and cost effectiveness of XR-B versus SL-B with individuals
in a jail who are re-entering community. Understanding how to expand acceptance of buprenorphine in jails,
has far-reaching implications for expanding treatment access in jail."
10820568,"Project Summary
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a relatively common monogenetic, multisystemic disorder that affects
approximately one in 3,500 individuals worldwide. The causative gene encodes a protein called
neurofibromin (Nf1), which essentially acts as a brake on Ras signaling via Ras-GAP activity. Nf1
affects multiple downstream signaling cascades, including central regulators of metabolism. Prior
studies have suggested that loss of Nf1 may affect metabolism, but the mechanisms, particularly at
the systemic level are unclear. Nf1 effects on metabolic processes may underlie or modulate some of
the symptoms of the disease, such as behavioral alterations and cancer predisposition.
This project will test the mechanisms underlying how loss of Nf1 affects metabolism in vivo, using the
powerful Drosophila model for neurofibromatosis type 1. Upon completion, we will have a clear
picture of: (1) the genes and cellular signaling cascades that regulate metabolism in an Nf1-
dependent manner, (2) how Nf1 functions in neuronal circuits to regulate metabolism through central
control, (3) the neurotransmitters and/or peptides that are involved in the central control of metabolic
regulation, (4) how loss of Nf1 mechanistically regulates peripheral energy stores through the effects
of novel genes. The highly conserved nature of Nf1 and its signaling functions, as well as
fundamental neuronal circuit functional principles, underscores the broad applicability of the results.
Overall, this project will contribute to understanding conserved Nf1 functions in metabolism and
neuronal function, laying the foundation for research into metabolic effects of Nf1 across organisms
and future development of novel therapeutic interventions."
10899599,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This career development award will support Chad Hochberg, MD MHS, to become an independent investigator
in critical care implementation science. In this award, Dr. Hochberg will build on his prior NHBLI-funded F32
studies investigating the changes in critical care practice that occurred early in the coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19) pandemic. With this award, he seeks further training in 1) Informatics to monitor and support
implementation, 2) Survey methodology, and 3) Developing, adapting, and evaluating implementation
strategies for intensive care unit (ICU) implementation trials. To achieve these goals, he has outlined a 5-year
career development plan that involves targeted didactics, hands-on research experience, and intensive
mentoring. This research and training will be facilitated by the highly supportive training environment at the
Johns Hopkins University, and guided by an experienced mentorship team with relevant expertise. Acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and deadly form of respiratory failure in patients receiving
mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning, a key evidence-based practice (EBP) for ARDS, involves positioning
patients to lie on their stomachs, facilitating less injurious mechanical ventilation. Despite strong evidence that
prone positioning reduces risk of death, it was historically underused. However, during the early COVID-19
pandemic, the use of prone positioning in patients with COVID-19 ARDS drastically increased compared to
historic practice. Yet, preliminary data show falling proning rates, and other implementation experience
suggests that without active intervention, appropriate use of this life-saving measure will decline. The
strategies needed to support the sustainability of prone positioning in ICU practice are unknown. In this K23,
Dr. Hochberg will use an established implementation framework, the dynamic sustainability framework, to
structure an investigation into the strategies needed to support sustainability of prone positioning in ICU
practice. In Aim 1, he will use granular patient-level data combined with staff surveys of ICU implementation
climate from the five-hospital Johns Hopkins Health System, and evaluate the associations between the
continued use of proning over time with specific patient characteristics and ICU implementation climate
domains. In Aim 2, he will further explore the influence of ICU climate and culture on proning processes using
a sequential explanatory mixed methods design. Finally, in Aim 3, he will conduct a pilot implementation trial to
support further penetration and sustainability of prone positioning in routine ICU practice, and will assess the
feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of this intervention using validated implementation surveys of ICU
staff. This research and training will establish a strong foundation for a career focused on implementation
science in critical care, and provide the preliminary data and experience for Dr. Hochberg to conduct a future
R01-level multisite intervention to improve the implementation of prone positioning and other EBPs for ARDS."
10903854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia in the United States with a 25% lifetime risk, and
accounts for one-third of all cardiovascular diseases. Treatment and care associated with AF costs roughly $26
billion/year in the United States alone and accounts for 10% of all Medicare spending. Debilitating complications
linked to AF include heart failure and stroke. The molecular links between genetics and AF disease risk are not
well understood and pose a significant knowledge gap for curative therapies and patient care. Common coding
and regulatory variations of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor (TF), PITX2, have been
resoundingly linked to AF risk. PITX2 is best known for regulating left-right asymmetry during development. In
the heart, PITX2 is expressed in the left atrial (LA) and pulmonary vein (PV) myocardium, the most common
trigger sites for AF. Mouse models of reduced Pitx2 are susceptible to AF, and my recent work describes how
decreased Pitx2 perturbs TF networks and hints at a developmental origin of AF risk; however, the mechanism
is unknown. The central hypothesis for this study is that PITX2 drives left-sided fate determination
through epigenetic remodeling, which imparts long-lasting transcriptional consequences underlying
adult disease. To address this hypothesis, the first aim proposes to investigate the Pitx2-dependent DNA
methylome in left-right determination. Left-right asymmetry established in gastrulation leads to Pitx2 expression
in the left but not right atria. I have uncovered that the left-right DNA methylation patterning differences occur at
PITX2 sites, suggesting PITX2 regulates DNA methylation. In the second aim, I will investigate the role of PITX2
left-right patterning in oxidative stress response and homeostasis. The PV delivers oxygen-rich blood, the only
vein to do so, to the LA from the lungs, creating a physiological distinction in oxygenation between left and right.
Oxygen-rich environments are prone to oxidative stress, contributing to AF risk. Preliminary work identified a
novel interaction between PITX2 and the oxidative response factor, OXR1, in the LA, and previous work
implicates PITX2 in oxidative stress response following ischemia through stress-response TF, NRF2. This aim
is designed to illuminate the role of PITX2 in mediating oxidative stress and the development of AF, a tractable
pathway for early intervention. In the final aim, I will investigate the molecular mechanisms of PITX2
transcriptional repression. Predominantly, PITX2 acts as a repressor in the LA. I identified a novel interaction
between PITX2 and the COPRS-PRMT5 arginine methyltransferase complex capable of histone H4R3
methylation, a repressive mark. Furthermore, PRMT5-dependent H4R3 methylation can be reversed, suggesting
a mechanism of tunable gene expression by PITX2. Altogether, the proposed project aims to understand the
role of PITX2 in epigenetic patterning of the LA in context of AF. The proposed study takes a novel approach to
interrogating the PITX2 gene regulatory network and develops several new reagents and datasets for the field.
Furthermore, through this work, I hope to gain insights for more targeted approaches in AF patient care."

Gliomas are the most common malignant primary brain tumors in adults. Among gliomas driven by mutant
isocitrate dehydrogenase, tumors harboring a 1p/19q codeletion are classified as oligodendrogliomas. Current
therapies such as radiation and chemotherapy are highly toxic and cause long-lasting and life-altering deficits
in cognitive and physical abilities. Importantly, although oligodendroglioma patients live for years with standard
treatment, tumors inevitably recur and cause patient death. Since the 1p/19q codeletion is a hallmark of
oligodendrogliomas, identifying metabolic vulnerabilities associated with the 1p/19 codeletion can lead to
precision medicines for oligodendroglioma patients. Glycolytic metabolism, in particular, fuels biosynthesis and
bioenergetics and is central to tumor proliferation. The glycolytic gene enolase 1, which is located on
chromosome 1p36.23, is lost in oligodendrogliomas due to the 1p/19q codeletion, leaving these tumors
dependent on enolase 2 (ENO2) for continued glycolysis. Our studies indicate that inhibiting ENO2 using a
safe, potent ENO2 inhibitor (POMHEX) downregulates glycolysis in patient-derived oligodendrogliomas.
However, ENO2 inhibition leads to a compensatory activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme. Importantly, combining POMHEX with the novel safe PDH inhibitor CPI-
613 completely abrogates glycolysis, the TCA cycle and oligodendroglioma growth. We will, therefore, test the
hypothesis that targeting ENO2 and PDH is a precision therapy strategy for oligodendrogliomas (Aim 1).
Successful translation of novel therapies is hindered by the lack of companion biomarkers that report on
response to therapy. Magnetic resonance imaging, which is the mainstay of glioma imaging, fails to accurately
report on response to therapy. Deuterium Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (DMRS) following administration
of 2H-labeled substrates such as glucose is a safe clinically translatable method of imaging glycolytic flux in
vivo. In Aim 2, we will examine the ability of 2H-glucose to report on response to ENO2 and PDH inhibition in
oligodendrogliomas in vivo at clinically relevant field strength (3T).
Our proposal is innovative and impactful because it will validate ENO2 and PDH as precision targets for
oligodendrogliomas in this era of genomic medicine. Since the safety of POMHEX and CPI-613 has been
established in primates and humans, and since DMRS can be readily deployed on clinical MR scanners, our
therapies and companion biomarkers have the potential to be rapidly translated to the clinic. In essence, by
simultaneously targeting metabolism for therapy and for imaging treatment response, our studies will enable
precision medicine that improves outcomes and quality of life for oligodendroglioma patients."

Sub-Saharan African countries are severely affected by the world’s most devastating infectious diseases,
including malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, neglected tropical diseases, and is experiencing an unprecedented
increase in noncommunicable diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. In the past
decades, public health, biomedical and clinical research have also increase significantly with support from the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other partnership. This partnership has contributed a breadth of diverse,
large, and complex clinical and biomedical data sets, providing unique opportunities for applying data sciences
for discoveries that may catalyze innovation in diagnosis, and therapy of diseases of public health interest in the
region. However, a critical gap is that these data remain under-exploited due to limited human resources with
skills and expertise in data sciences to harness the value of these data to have a meaningful public health impact.
The overall objective of this UE5 Research Education Program involving the University of Sciences,
Techniques and Technology of Bamako (USTTB) and Gamal Abdel Nasser University of Conakry, Guinea
(UGANC) with support from Tulane University is to build interdisciplinary teams across multiple African
institutions capable of using innovative quantitative and analytical approaches to generate and apply new
knowledge from large or complex sets of data in the subregion through the following specific aims: 1)
Strengthen existing institutional research training programs to address the needs for optimal use and
processing of large and complex data sets using advanced data science approaches. We will provide faculty
enhancement training and develop advanced data sciences courses for enriching curricula of existing Masters
and PhD programs and professional development short-term training (medical residents, public health, clinicians
and junior researchers); 2) Develop and deliver datathon (i.e., data analysis hackathon) training that
involves multidisciplinary collaboration among researchers, data engineers, machine-learning experts,
statisticians, and other information scientists. Datathon participants will perform team-oriented approaches in
response to research questions of interest in the area of infectious disease outcomes (e.g., malaria, NTDs,
TB/HIV, or emerging infectious diseases) and develop solutions in group settings; and 3) Produce a critical
mass of trained public health professionals, disease control managers, and researchers capable of
working closely together to use data sciences to refine and guide control interventions most effectively
through short courses sequence focused on hands-on advanced data science. Developped short-term training
sessions and modules through a multifaceted approach to facilitate partnership among researchers and local
faculty and stakeholders for future implementation of data sciences research."

Profiling antibody response to disease-associated antigens is important to cancer research. In contrast to the
historical approach of testing responses to individual proteins, screening and diagnosis increasingly rely on
multiplexed assays to elucidate disease and patient heterogeneity. Protein microarrays allow proteome-scale
screening with low sample consumption but are constrained by binding kinetics of surface-bound proteins,
non-specific binding, limited dynamic range of fluorescence detection and not readily available in clinics.
Peptide-based approaches limit the assay to linear epitopes. With support from IMAT R21, we have
developed a next-generation, liquid-phase protein microarray platform, “Multiplex In Solution Protein Array”
(MISPA), which exploits the extraordinary dynamic range of next generation sequencing (NGS) with wide
applicability in both research and clinical labs. We quantitatively profiled the immune responses of
oropharyngeal (OPSCC) patient and control samples using a “barcoded” human papillomavirus (HPV)
antigen library for 12 HPV subtypes NGS. The assay successfully detected the positive responses in the
OPSCC samples and demonstrated greater signal-to-background ratio, reproducibility, and dynamic range.
Subsequently, we have advanced MISPA to assay antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, seasonal
coronaviruses, and other respiratory pathogens in more than 1000 samples simultaneously as part of the
NCI SeroNet with over 90% overall percent agreement with a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis and commercial
EUA serological assays. In the R33 phase, we propose to further develop the MISPA platform to a fully
automated research platform that is quantitative, robust, highly reproducible, high-throughput, and
inexpensive for early cancer screening. We will establish SOPs for robust protein production, stable protein
library storage, and minimal reagent lot-to-lot variations. We will demonstrate the versality of MISPA by
increasing the barcoded protein library size to 192 by including antigens from different subtype of HPV, other
viruses, bacteria, fungi and tumor antigens. We will improve reproducibility and throughput with end-to end
automation for the MISPA platform to support large-scale projects requiring assaying tens of thousands
samples. We will determine the limit of blank, limit of detection, linear dynamic range, precision, and other
performance measures for quantitative assays. We will profile the 192 cancer related antibodies in hundreds
of patients with OPSCC and cervical cancer and more than 1,000 cancer free controls and benchmark the
performance with the current gold standard ELISA platform. Our experience with developing innovative high-
throughput immunoproteomics platforms using laboratory automation and the quality of our preliminary data
speak for our competency in implementing our proposed development. A quantitatively reproducible assay to
measure hundreds of antibodies against full length properly folded proteins in thousands of individuals
simultaneously will greatly benefit cancer sero-epidemiology, risk assessment and screening."

Black/African American young adults are at elevated risk for trauma and related mental health concerns (e.g.,
PTSD, substance use) yet are less likely to engage in mental health care than other groups, due to substantial
and complex barriers to care. These disparities have been exacerbated by, and compounded with,
psychological and emotional distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting mental health literacy (MHL),
defined as knowledge and beliefs related to mental health (e.g., recognition, prevention, and management of
symptoms) may be an important first step to improving mental health outcomes for Black/African American
young adults. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will partner with a Community
Advisory Board to develop a community based MHL intervention, focused on trauma and substance use, for
Black/African American young adults. The culturally tailored intervention will be guided by the Theory of
Planned Behavior (TPB) and social ecological model as guiding frameworks, with intervention components
designed to promote TPB dimensions (i.e., behavioral, normative, and control beliefs related to mental health
care utilization) with resources at the individual, interpersonal, and organizational levels. Following
development, the intervention will be piloted among Black/African American young adults aged 18-35 years old
(N = 80), recruited from diverse community sites (e.g., colleges/universities, barbershops and hair salons,
churches, community organizations). Participants will complete a baseline survey assessing primary and
secondary outcomes (e.g., current MHL; stigma; beliefs, attitudes, and norms; history of mental health care),
with re-assessment mid-intervention and post-intervention. Post-study focus groups with intervention
participants (N = 30) will be held to elicit feedback on relevance, feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with
the intervention, to inform refinement and future dissemination efforts. Successful completion of the proposed
study will also benefit the PI, an early career researcher with goals to A) develop expertise in community
engagement and theoretically-driven translational research methods and B) build community capacity to
prevent mental illness, support recovery, and improve health outcomes with underserved and oppressed
communities. The PI is currently an Assistant Research Professor at Rutgers University at the Center of
Alcohol & Substance Use Studies, within the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology. Her
long-term career goals include becoming a tenure-track, independent investigator; contributing to recruitment
and mentorship of underrepresented students; and advancing health and social equity for underserved and
minoritized communities."

 Sensory representations are influenced by an animal’s external context, internal state, past
experiences, expectations, and future goals. Prior information – including the history of recent stimuli,
actions and rewards – plays an important role in guiding ongoing behavior, and can modulate the neural
code even at the level of primary sensory cortex. The involvement of sensory cortex in mediating history-
dependent shifts in behavior, and the contributions of specific cell types to these effects are not well
understood. Using a novel whisker-based behavioral paradigm, I have demonstrated that mice can flexibly
and selectively enhance sensory processing of recently rewarded whisker stimuli based on history cues.
Here, I propose experiments to uncover the cell type-specific mechanisms in for history-based modulation
in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), and test for their causal role in behavior.
 In Aim 1 (K99), I will use behavioral modeling approaches to systematically quantify history-based
perceptual biases during goal-directed behavior in mice. I will examine modulation of pyramidal (PYR)
cell activity in S1 of behaving mice while tracking trial-by-trial behavioral shifts in sensory detection
performance guided by recent history. I will then empirically test the necessity of S1 in mediating history
effects on behavior using reversible inactivation techniques. Two cortical interneuron classes, namely VIP
cells and NDNF cells, are widely theorized to play a role in selective enhancement of sensory processing
in cortex, since they receive a wide range of glutamatergic and neuromodulatory inputs and boost sensory
responses in PYR cells through local disinhibition. Both these cell types are activated in different active
behavioral states and learning contexts. In Aim 2 (K99/R00), I will test the role of VIP and NDNF interneurons
in gating history-related signals using 2p imaging to monitor their neural activity, and through targeted activation
or inactivation of these cell types using optogenetic techniques. VIP and NDNF interneurons are both recruited
by acetylcholine, a neuromodulator that is necessary for stimulus-specific enhancement of sensory processing
in primates, and behavioral state-based modulation of sensory cortex in rodents. In Aim 3 (R00), I will test the
role of basal forebrain cholinergic projections in conveying history-related signals to S1. I will perform two-photon
imaging of cholinergic terminals in S1 and use selective optogenetic activation to test whether the locus of
prioritized processing on the whiskers can be artificially shifted in behaving mice. Together, the proposed studies
will provide new insights into the local cortical circuits that facilitate prioritized processing of behaviorally
relevant stimuli in sensory maps."
10908701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Damage to the vascular endothelium is responsible for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of
mortality in patients with autoimmune diseases. In idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), this process is
particularly relevant as vascular damage is implicated in the disease pathogenesis as well as its associated
major organ complication, interstitial lung disease (IIM-ILD). However, the precise mechanisms of ongoing
endothelial activation and vascular damage in IIM are currently not well understood. The proposed research
addresses a critical knowledge gap regarding the pathogenesis of vascular injury in IIM and IIM-ILD by
investigating a novel mechanism for perpetuation of vascular damage mediated by dysfunctional high-density
lipoproteins (HDL). HDL normally protects vascular endothelium from damage, but under certain inflammatory
states, HDL may lose its anti-inflammatory properties and become a dysfunctional, pro-inflammatory particle
that promotes endothelial cell damage. Our recent work demonstrates that the antioxidant function of HDL and
HDL-associated antioxidant enzyme paraoxonase-1(PON1) activity are impaired in patients with IIM, and
correlate with more active disease. The gut microbiome has shown strong associations with HDL and is known
to impact cardiovascular and lung health. Our preliminary results of the gut microbiome in IIM and controls
show a link between microbial composition and PON1 activity. We hypothesize that changes in HDL-
associated enzymes and proteins, pro-inflammatory bioactive mediators (BLM) and the gut microbiome result
in dysfunctional HDL, leading to the perpetuation of vascular endothelial damage and ultimately increased IIM
disease burden. We will use a longitudinal IIM cohort and comprehensive assessments of HDL function to
study the following specific aims: (1) evaluate the association between abnormal HDL function and
vasculopathy; (2) determine whether changes in abnormal HDL function over time correlate with disease
burden; and (3) examine the association of gut microbiome with HDL function and disease burden. The project
will be conducted at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) with the support of a multidisciplinary
team of mentors comprised of nationally recognized experts, and numerous resources of a major academic
institution, including graduate courses, core facilities, and career development seminars. Completion of the
proposed project and training plan will facilitate advanced training in the following areas: (1) microbiome study
design, data collection sequencing and analysis; (2) laboratory techniques and statistical analysis methods for
complex biomarker panels; and (3) disease outcome measures in IIM, including a quantitative imaging scoring
system in IIM-ILD. Training in these areas will provide a foundation to achieve my long-term goal, to be an
independent physician-scientist combining clinical, experimental and computational approaches to detect
unique microbial and lipid function signatures that impact disease-related vascular damage, in order to identify
novel therapeutic targets that may improve the lives of patients with autoimmune diseases including IIM."
10917332,"Summary/Abstract: The risk for developing future psychiatric and addiction disorders starts early in life, with
evidence emphasizing the critical contribution of the in utero environment. Maternal psychosocial stress has a
significant impact on the prenatal environment and contributes to negative health and neurobehavioral outcomes in
offspring. Our research (Stress in Pregnancy, SIP study), along with that of others, has shown that in utero exposure
to maternal psychosocial stress is a major predictor of the risk for fear-related and impulse control-related problems
during early childhood. We are now well positioned to conduct a long-term follow-up of our unique racially and
financially diverse SIP study population to identify biomarkers of children’s behavior and physiological reactivity
relevant for future subsequent behavioral disorders and addictive risk. Despite its importance, few studies have
investigated placental molecular signatures to bio-behavioral assessments from early life through the pre/pubertal
phase. Exploiting the SIP study's bio-repositories and deep-phenotyped child behaviors, our preliminary results show
that epigenetic changes of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immune systems are associated with
fear, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation among children exposed to in utero maternal stress. The SIP study cohort
has many strengths: its consistent long-term follow-up, from in utero, its diversity (financially and racially), its
extensive repository of stored biospecimens (placenta, toenail, hair samples), and its quasi-experimental design.
The cohort is now entering pre/puberty (ages 9-13), a time for rapid social and biological transition and a peak time
for the emergence of maladaptive, risk-taking behaviors with the brain still developing cognitive functions. Using
this unparalleled opportunity, we will follow the cohort to 1) examine the role of exposure to SS in utero along with
the effect of postnatal stress (normative stress, parenting) on neurodevelopmental functioning, as measured by
multiple behavioral, physiological, and neuropsychological assessments; 2) determine the relationship between
the prenatal epigenome signature in the placenta (along with an a priori focus on the HPA-axis and immune network
genes) on the subsequent risk for negative behavioral characteristics (i.e., excessive anxiety and disruptive
behaviors) and impaired executive functioning, known to elevate the risk for early initiation of substance use.
Following our prior work, we will also examine sex-specific manifestations of the behavioral phenotypes (more
internalizing problems in girls and externalizing in boys). We will further explore the moderating role of
socioeconomic status when intersecting with prenatal SS-stress and postnatal stress on individual differences in
cognitive neuro-behaviors, which make pre/pubescent children more vulnerable for a subsequent onset of
behavioral and addictive disorders. We will build on our unique repository of stored biospecimens and profile
chromatin accessibility across the epigenome and RNA expression network in the placenta. Given the steeply
increasing incidence of adverse stressors, especially natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires and pandemics),
investigation of the short- and long-term impact of SS-stress on neurodevelopment from in utero through
pre/puberty, will help us to identify problems and potentially lead to significant interventions for mother and child."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health emergency, responsible for 10 million new cases in 2021. Despite the
global community's extensive effort to identify TB cases, 30% of the new cases were never diagnosed. Current
efforts focus on active case finding of TB which is expensive and difficult to implement in practice. One approach
that can address the challenges is self-testing. Self-testing for TB has not been widely implemented to date, due
in part to a lack of appropriate testing modalities and studies evaluating this approach. However, recent advances
in diagnostic tools make self-testing a realistic possibility, opening a new door for patient-centered TB care.
I propose a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness study to evaluate the feasibility of implementing self-
testing for active TB. I will apply a currently available diagnostic tool – oral swab specimens for Xpert Ultra (which
are easy to self-collect and highly sensitive but require shipping to a laboratory). I will first identify barriers to the
implementation of TB self-testing and refine the implementation strategies to address these barriers by using
qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys (Aim 1). I will then perform a prospective study in six high-risk
occupational settings in South Africa, where working-age individuals are known to rarely seek care, placing oral
swab kits in three interventional sites and maintaining the standard of care in three control sites (Aim 2). I will
evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of each strategy guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adopt,
Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. My primary outcome will be an increase in the
proportion of individuals receiving microbiological testing results, reflecting the acceptability and fidelity of TB
self-testing. To achieve the aims, I will use a highly pragmatic study design in which the study team minimizes
contact with the study sites. This will enable me to evaluate whether the implementation of TB self-testing is
likely to impact case finding and improve working-aged individuals’ health outcomes in a “real world” setting.
Completion of this study will generate pragmatic, preliminary data on the potential implementation and
effectiveness of TB self-testing in high-burden settings, which if successful will justify a larger trial and if not will
inform alternative approaches to overcoming barriers to seeking care for TB. In either case, these findings will
motivate a larger R01 proposal at the end of the five-year grant period and advance the field of TB self-testing.
While this proposal will evaluate self-testing using an available tool, a broader goal is to conceptualize the self-
testing strategy in TB disease that will be applicable to future tools, thus representing a step toward improving
patient-initiated or patient-centered TB care. The study will also serve as a vehicle for me to acquire skills in
mixed methods study and implementation science, positioning me as a future leader in implementing patient-
centered TB interventions in the global health context.

In April 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a proposed ban on menthol cigarettes
and all characterizing flavors in cigars. African Americans have high rates of menthol cigarette and flavored cigar
use, which likely contributes to their disproportionate experience of tobacco-related health conditions. In
response to the FDA’s announcement, the tobacco industry and its sources promulgated disinformation in
African American communities about the increased criminalization and police discrimination for using tobacco
products when the rules are enforced. Although the FDA has stated that it cannot and will not enforce actions
against individual consumers for possessing or using menthol cigarettes or flavored cigars, disinformation about
the flavor ban and its harmful impacts continues spreading among African American communities. The proposed
study seeks to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of multi-level, anti-disinformation messages (ADM) to
disrupt the spread and mitigate the detrimental effects of disinformation about the FDA’s proposed ban on
menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars. In Aim 1, we will employ community-based participatory research
methods to develop and engage with an Expert Advisory Board (EAB) that will engage in shared decision-making
and provide their perspectives on all study activities. In Aim 2, we will conduct formative research to a)
characterize the tobacco industry and its operatives’ rhetoric about the consequences of the anticipated flavor
ban and b) elicit AA/Bs’ knowledge and perceptions about the anticipated flavor ban. Aim 2 data will inform the
development of the Intervention Mapping (IM) logic models that depict the behavioral and environmental risk
factors and determinants of respondents’ flavor ban receptivity. In Aim 3, we will use of IM process to develop,
pre-test, and refine the individual and community-level ADM and creative concepts among AA/B participants.
Finally, in Aim 4, we will conduct a randomized treatment and control evaluation design to test the effectiveness
of our individual and community-based ADM campaign on AA/Bs’ receptivity to the flavor ban and counter-
industry beliefs. Knowledge gained from this study will inform the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products
Communication Office and state and local public health departments regarding salient messages to
communicate about the flavor ban to AA/B and other vulnerable populations."
