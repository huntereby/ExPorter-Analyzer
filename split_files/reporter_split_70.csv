Cognitive and behavioral (anxiety and depression) deficits are two potentially life-altering complications of sickle
cell disease (SCD). Loss of full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ), interference with employability, navigation of
healthcare resources and overall quality of life are some of the consequences of cognitive deficit in SCD patients.
The molecular and cellular factors that mediate the development of these complications are still largely unknown.
This proposal aims to define the role of neuroinflammation in development of abnormal neuroplasticity and how
the two are temporally related to onset of cognitive and behavioral deficit in SCD. We will also attempt to identify
some small molecules and treatment strategies that could have utility in prevention and/or treatment of SCD-
associated cognitive and behavioral deficit. Our preliminary studies have shown that sickle cell mice developed
cognitive and behavioral deficit that occur with age and neuroinflammation and thus our central hypothesis is
that the development of cognitive deficits in SCD is due to neuroinflammation and abnormal
neuroplasticity defined by decreased density of dendritic arbors, dendritic spines and, the proportion of
immature dendritic spines. We will also examine the potential role or contribution from cerebral infarcts and
microvasculopathy. This will be rigorously tested with the following aims (1) Determine the temporal
relationship between presence of cognitive (learning and memory) deficit in SCD, and abnormal
neuroplasticity and/or the burden of cerebral infarcts and microvasculopathy. This will enable us to
establish a temporal relationship between the onset of cognitive and behavioral deficit, and onset of abnormal
neuroplasticity as well as the burden of cerebral microinfarct. (2) Demonstrate the role of neuroinflammation,
as well as the therapeutic benefit of minocycline in treating cognitive deficits in SCD. This will be done by
establishing baseline relationship between onset and progression of cellular and molecular evidence of
neuroinflammation and onset and progression of abnormal neuroplasticity as well as development of cognitive
and behavioral deficit. Additionally, we will examine whether blocking neuroinflammation could be a potential
target for the treatment or prevention of SCD associated cognitive and behavioral deficit. (3) Determine whether
treatment with a neurotrophin agonist treatment or anti-neuroinflammatory mediators reverses
neuroinflammation, abnormal neuroplasticity and cognitive deficit in SCD. These studies are design to
enable us identify small molecule(s) and/or small molecule target(s) and provide the preclinical information that
could support a clinical trial geared towards identifying treatment and prevention strategies for cognitive and
behavioral deficit in SCD."
10984705,"Project Summary/Abstract. NUT-fusion oncoproteins, most commonly BRD4-NUT, drive NUT carcinoma
(NC), an aggressive, poorly differentiated squamous cancer with a 6.5-month median survival and < 20% 3-
year survival. NC predominantly affects adolescents and young adults and, with no routinely effective therapy,
has a critical unmet need. BRD4-NUT drives growth by altering histone modifications and chromatin 3D
structure to upregulate expression of pro-growth genes. We demonstrated that BET bromodomain inhibitors
reverse these epigenetic modifications and block tumor growth. These findings led to the treatment of NC and
numerous other malignancies with BET inhibitors. However, the clinical efficacy of BET inhibitor monotherapy
is limited, indicating that BET inhibitors alone do not fully address NC biology. The goal of this proposal is to
overcome the limitations of BET inhibition in NC and therefore improve patient outcomes by identifying
targetable mechanisms of gene regulation that maintain NC growth.
Using our combined expertise in translational NC cancer biology (CA French) and chromatin biology (KP Eagen)
we will take a two-pronged approach to improve NC treatment through mechanism-based target discovery. Both
prongs share the premise that identifying factors that cooperate with BRD4-NUT to promote NC growth will
lead to new therapeutic targets. Our first Aim is based upon our recent discovery that repression of tumor
suppressor genes by the histone methyltransferase EZH2 complements oncogene activation by BRD4-NUT.
Simultaneous inhibition of EZH2 and BRD4-NUT synergistically blocks NC growth in vitro and in vivo. However,
the precise mechanism of synergy remains unknown. Additionally, toxicity was observed in some xenograft
models, and thus toxicity in humans is likely. Therefore, we propose to identify more precise therapeutic targets
by determining key factors that mediate the oncogenic synergy between EZH2 and BRD4-NUT. Our second Aim
is motivated by the discovery of a novel MLL1::NUTM1 fusion in a patient. Our proteomics data indicate that
MLL1 and its key binding partner MENIN are both present in the BRD4-NUT oncogenic complex providing
biochemical evidence that this fusion may reveal new factors that cooperate with BRD4-NUT. Accordingly,
inhibiting the interaction between MLL1 and MENIN induces differentiation and blocks growth of NC cells. The
combination of MENIN-MLL1 with EZH2 inhibition synergistically blocks NC growth in vitro. This data suggests
that combination therapy with MENIN-MLL1 and EZH2 inhibitors could potentially replace BET inhibition, which
we will test in pre-clinical models of NC.
Aim 1. Determine the mechanism by which EZH2 cooperates with BRD4-NUT to drive NC growth.
Aim 2. Elucidate the role of MENIN in BRD4-NUT oncogenic function."

Expansion of Medicare coverage of telehealth services during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) removed
many of the barriers to telehealth provision in nursing homes (NHs). In 2020, 58% of Medicare Advantage (MA) plans
covered additional telehealth benefits in NHs, beyond those reimbursed by Medicare fee-for-service (FFS). Over three
years after the pandemic's onset and given that Medicare waivers supporting telehealth use in NHs will end in December
2024, new evidence is critically needed to assess the impact of telehealth on long-standing gaps in access to specialty
care and overall quality of care for NH residents with Alzheimer's disease or related dementias (ADRD). For long-
stay NH residents with ADRD, who make up over half of all NH residents, increased telehealth provision may allow more
timely access to routine and specialty care, provide clinicians and caregivers with an important layer of audiovisual
information to make more informed patient-centered decisions, and facilitate communication between residents,
providers, and caregivers. While telehealth has the potential to reduce potentially avoidable hospitalizations and
emergency department visits for NH residents through these mechanisms and others, there may be unintended
consequences of broader telehealth use, and challenges to using telehealth for residents with ADRD. The overall
objectives of this study are to leverage the natural experiments surrounding changes in access to telehealth among
Medicare FFS and MA-enrolled long-stay NH residents, to examine how telehealth has been used to supplement or
replace in-person patient care and to measure the relationship between telehealth use and the quality and cost of care. We
will focus on the following specific aims: (1) To examine how telehealth is and has been used for long-stay residents with
ADRD, using qualitative methods to generate nuanced insights into multiple predictors of, barriers to, and constraints on
use. We will conduct semi-structured interviews with NH medical directors and resident caregivers to explore multiple
implementation domains, including NH characteristics associated with telehealth provision.; (2) To characterize the
uptake and patterns of telehealth and in-person care from 2018 through 2024 for long-stay NH residents with ADRD; and
(3) To measure the relationship between access to telehealth among long-stay NH residents with ADRD and the
utilization, quality, and cost of care from 2018 through 2024. This application is innovative because it will be the first to
measure telehealth use for long-stay residents enrolled in both Medicare FFS and in MA. It will also be the first to
quantify the potential benefits of increasing access to telehealth services in NHs for long-stay residents with ADRD. The
findings from our mixed methods approach will provide nuanced qualitative insights on NH leadership decision-making
surrounding telehealth, frontline facilitators and barriers to telehealth at multiple levels, and the degree to which family
members and caretakers may benefit from telehealth. The proposed research is significant since Medicare coverage of
many telehealth services is set to expire in December 2024. This project will shed light on the potential impacts of
reducing access to telehealth for NH residents and individuals with ADRD. Importantly, it will also inform NIH goals for
expanded research on the use and efficacy of telehealth to improve the delivery of care for people living with ADRD."

The aging population is rapidly growing. Aging is associated with impaired organ function and repair and
increased susceptibility to various chronic diseases. Angiogenesis – the formation of new blood capillaries-
plays a key role in organ development and regeneration. Angiogenesis is impaired in aging animals and
contributes to age-related pathologies. In order to develop more efficient therapies for aging-associated
diseases, we need to understand the mechanisms by which aging impairs angiogenesis. Senescent cells
promote aging and exacerbate age-related pathologies. The levels of endothelial cell (EC) senescence are
higher in aged ECs compared to young ECs, mediating age-dependent impairment of angiogenesis.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as a messenger of signals, maintaining tissue homeostasis and function in
physiology and contributing to age-related diseases. EVs collected from lung ECs under regeneration stimulate
angiogenesis, while senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors are enriched in EVs from senescent
ECs, highlighting EC-derived EVs (EC-EVs) as a critical contributor to age-dependent decline in angiogenesis.
EVs contain and transfer a diverse cargo of proteins, lipids, and various types of nucleic acid to target cells and
control cell-cell communications. Among EV-enclosed RNAs, Y-RNAs are one of the most abundant non-
coding RNAs in EVs, and the levels of Y-RNAs correlate with age-related cardiovascular diseases, in which
angiogenesis is deregulated. The role of EV-enclosed Y-RNAs in EC senescence and age-related decline in
angiogenesis remains unclear. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine whether EV-enclosed Y-RNAs
mediate age-dependent impairment of angiogenesis. Among four human Y-RNAs (Y1, 3, 4, 5), Y5-RNA is the
most abundant Y-RNAs in EC-EVs. Our preliminary data demonstrate that: (1) conditioned media (CM) that
contains EVs, from aged human ECs induces senescence in young ECs; (2) the levels of Y5-RNA are lower in
EVs collected from CM of aged ECs; (3) overexpression of Y5-RNA 5’ fragment suppresses senescence and
restores migration in aged ECs; (4) Y5-RNA knocked down EC-EVs inhibit DNA synthesis in young ECs; and
(5) young EC-EVs restore blood vessel formation of aged ECs in the subcutaneously implanted hydrogel, while
Y5-RNA knocked down EC-EVs inhibit the effects. We hypothesize that age-dependent decreases in Y5-RNA
in EC-EVs mediate EC senescence and impairment of angiogenesis in aged ECs. In Aim 1, we will examine
whether Y5-RNA in EC-EVs mediates age-dependent induction of EC senescence. In Aim 2, we will determine
whether Y5-RNA in EC-EVs mediates age-dependent decline in angiogenesis in vitro and in the gel implanted
on mice. Our focus to investigate the effects of Y5-RNA in EC-EVs on EC senescence and age-dependent
impairment of angiogenesis is unique and conceptually innovative. If this study proves that manipulation of Y5-
RNA in aged EC-EVs reverses the age-related decline in angiogenesis, this work will lead to the development
of new and efficient EV-based strategies for age-related diseases."
10985901,"Project Summary: The goal of the proposed project is to develop and validate a novel motion correction
technique for 2D T2-weighted structural MRI of the brain. Head motion continues to be a substantial problem in
the clinical setting, especially in patients who are confused or agitated, and in children and infants. A range of
methods have been developed to attenuate motion artifacts for structural brain MRI from patients who move.
These include prospective motion correction (PMC) using navigators for 3D acquisitions, as well as a special k-
space trajectory (PROPELLER) that allows correction of in-plane motions during reconstruction of 2D scans.
However, an entire class of motion artifacts in 2D structural MRI scans, including those from T2-weighted
(T2W) scans, is not addressed by current motion correction techniques: those caused by Slice Alignment
Errors (SAEs). These SAEs are caused by uncorrected through-plane movements and can occur both across
and within excitations. We will develop a novel navigator that uses the spin history in slice direction as a “spin
tag” to obtain fast estimates of the 3 through-plane velocities (1 translational and 2 rotational), which will then
be used to realign slice objects in real-time (across and within excitations). The new navigator will be
implemented with a standard RARE (or TSE) as well as a PROPELLER sequence. Optimized techniques will
be validated in healthy subjects, using quantitative quality metrics. We hypothesize that elimination of SAEs “at
the source” will significantly improve the quality of 2D T2W scans. Our Specific Aims are as follows.
Aim 1: Develop a fast MR-based through-plane (“slice velocity”) navigator using spin-history profiles.
 Aim 1A: Develop and optimize the navigator to measure through-plane translational velocity (vz).
 Aim 1B: Develop and optimize the navigator to measure through-plane rotational velocities (ωx and ωy).
 Rationale: in first order, these 3 through-plane velocities fully determine SAEs and are the basis for Aim 2.
Aim 2: Use through-plane velocities to correct SAEs in real-time in 2D RARE and PROPELLER scans.
 Aim 2A: Eliminate spin history effects across excitations and TR periods for RARE (e.g., TSE/FSE) scans.
 Aim 2B: Eliminate slice alignment errors (SAEs) within each RARE echo train.
 Aim 2C: Combine correction of through-plane motions with in-plane motion correction of PROPELLER.
 Rationale: the through-plane velocities from Aim 1 predict temporal changes in slice positions (in first order).
 PROPELLER provides in-plane motion correction but can fail when through-plane movements occur.
Aim 3: Validate optimized motion-robust MRI methods in 10 healthy participants using trained motions.
 Hypothesis: in trained subjects who move intentionally, visual and quantitative quality metrics of T2W scans
 with motion correction ON will demonstrate better image quality than scans with motion correction OFF.
Future work will add our navigator approach to FLAIR, DWI and BOLD-fMRI. Since T2W MRI is the
“workhorse” of clinical neuro-MRI, the proposed method promises improved diagnostic accuracy."

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, especially constipation, affect >50% of persons with PD (PwPD). However,
these concepts are exclusively based on tertiary care studies that used incomplete definitions of constipation.
Our population study found that constipation preceded the motor symptoms of PD by up to 20 or more years.
Our proposal is predicated on the integrated, multi-hit hypothesis that environmental exposures, especially in
genetically vulnerable persons, are perpetuated by an inflammatory gut microbiome and epigenetic changes,
resulting in accumulation of misfolded α synuclein in the gut and its transfer to the central nervous system,
followed by enteric and central neurodegeneration, GI and anorectal dysfunctions, and GI symptoms in PD. This
proposal will assimilate the bigger-picture cellular networks that drive disease processes, enteric
neuropathology, brain-gut dysfunctions, and the clinical phenotype in PwPD-C and without constipation (PwPD-
noC). We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team from the Departments of Gastroenterology, Neurology,
Physiology, and Radiology and the Center for Individualized Medicine at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Gary Miller (Columbia
University), and Dr. Rodger Liddle (Duke University) to compare brain-gut dysfunctions (Aim 1), omics-based
disease signatures (Aim 2), and the exposome (Aim 3) in 60 PwPD-C, 60 PwPD-noC, and 30 healthy controls.
When integrated with the clinical phenotype, this information will identify biomarkers and pathways that
predispose to constipation in PwPD. Aim 1 will compare neurological and GI clinical features, in vivo GI functions
(GI transit and anorectal functions), enteric neuropathology (α-synuclein deposition in EEC and neurons and
neuronal loss) and neuroimaging abnormalities (18FFDG-PET and MRI) in PwPD-C, PwPD-noC, and healthy
controls. Aim 2 will discover changes in gut microbial composition and dynamics associated with PD-C by
assessing the fecal metagenome (Aim 2a) and the colonic mucosal transcriptome (Aim 2b) and epigenome (Aim
2c). Aim 3 will identify signatures associated with PD-C in and across the peripheral blood exposome and
metabolome. We will identify exogenous chemical exposures (e.g., pollutants and pesticides) representing the
exposome and endogenous small molecule metabolites representing biological pathways or the metabolome
using cutting-edge high-resolution mass spectroscopy platforms and environmental questionnaires. Integrated
with the epigenome and transcriptome, Aim 3 will likely enrich our understanding of the risk factors for PD."

The human virome, i.e. the collection of viruses found in or on humans, is a complex set of viral
communities whose diversity is only now starting to be explored and described. Along with viruses infecting
humans and causing diseases, the human virome includes many viruses infecting microorganisms part of the
human microbiome as well as transient viruses originating from e.g. food or drinking sources. Most of these
viruses are currently known only through metagenomics, i.e. assays through which the genomes of viruses
present in a given sample are sequenced directly without the need for laboratory cultivation or isolation.
Because of challenges in analyzing this broad diversity of viral genomes, however, the biological information
extracted from these metagenome-assembled viral genomes remains limited at this stage.
As the field of viromics was being established, most of the effort so far has been focused on the development
of methods to comprehensively identify the genomes of known and novel viruses in metagenomes. This
resulted in multiple efficient tools for viral sequence detection, and the creation of large-scale catalogs of
genomes from different parts of the human virome. Critical for understanding the biology of these viruses,
however, will be our ability to classify these new viruses in a robust taxonomic framework, link these
viruses to their host(s), and functionally annotate a majority of the genes they encode. Some approaches
have been proposed to address these questions, but current tools are inadequate either in terms of resolution,
accuracy, and/or throughput. Moreover, some of the most promising methods, such as the use of innovative AI
for genome annotation, are only available as experimental software and not ready for large-scale application.
Here, we aim to establish the necessary tools, curated databases, and integrated pipelines to enable any
researcher with a set of viral genomes to (i) classify these viruses in quasi-taxa enabling robust comparison to
other similar studies at multiple ranks, (ii) predict the most likely host(s) taxa and/or strains infected by these
viruses, and (iii) identify the genetic potential and thus potential role(s) and impact(s) of these viruses. We will
build this work on our previous experience in developing advanced viromics tools and databases, as well as
recent developments in viral taxonomy, large-scale comparative genomics, and machine-learning for sequence
analysis. Specifically, we intend to develop new genome comparison and clustering approaches to provide a
comprehensive genome-based viral taxonomy database and an associated toolkit; expand the current host
prediction tools by integrating large-scale CRISPR detection and viral phenotype prediction in a virus-host
network framework to enable virus-host linkage at the strain level; and establish a new functional annotation
pipeline leveraging protein structure prediction and genomic neighborhood. We intend to develop these new
tools in close collaboration with members of the Human Virome Program to build a robust viromics toolkit
enabling researchers to thoroughly investigate the direct and indirect impact(s) of these viruses on humans."

 Peripheral neuropathies are major neurological complications of multiple chemotherapy drugs
causing significant morbidity affecting quality of life and potentially altering life-saving chemotherapy
regimens. Many chemotherapy drugs with diverse mechanisms of actions cause axonal degeneration and
the underlying mechanisms that lead to distal axonal degeneration, a common feature of most peripheral
neuropathies, are poorly understood. Furthermore, currently there are no therapies aimed at preventing,
reversing, or slowing the progression of peripheral neuropathies that cause chronic neuropathic pain,
sensory loss, and weakness.
 In this exploratory R21 grant we will test the overall hypothesis that MAP4K4 inhibition protects
peripheral sensory neurons against toxicity of several chemotherapy drugs and prevents chemotherapy-
induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). This hypothesis is built upon unpublished preliminary data that we
generated through an unbiased kinase inhibitor screen we performed to prevent chemotherapy induced
neurotoxicity. In these preliminary studies we found that PF-06260933 dihydrochloride (PF062), a MAP4K4
inhibitor, provided robust protection against neurotoxicity of Paclitaxel (PTX), and Cisplatin (CDDP) and
Bortezomib (BTZ) in vitro. These studies suggest that axon degeneration cascades initiated by three
chemotherapy drugs with different mechanisms of action (paclitaxel, cisplatin, and bortezomib) converge
on MAP4K4 and that inhibitors of MAP4K4 can be used to prevent neurotoxicity of different chemotherapy
drugs.
 We propose to test this hypothesis further by validating the neuroprotective effects of MAP4K4
inhibitors from different chemical classes as well as using genetic knockdown experiments. Furthermore,
we will test the role of MAP4K4 inhibition in vivo. Completion of these studies will give us a better
understanding of the role of MAP4K4 in distal axonal degeneration in CIPN and help further explore a novel
therapeutic target that can be taken to clinical studies in a timely manner."

The virome is heterogenous and widely distributed across the whole body. Given the challenges of obtaining
deeper tissues from healthy individuals, however, it is unknown how these viruses persist across various
anatomical, histological, and cellular environments or how host immune and inflammatory responses differ
across these compartments in response to infection. Thus, it is essential for the Human Virome Project (HVP)
to include studies of deeper tissues in the general (healthy) population. To address these critical knowledge
gaps, we will leverage our unique longitudinal POstmortemSystematic InvesTigation of Sudden Cardiac Death
(POST SCD) Study, a prospective postmortem study of consecutive victims of out-of-hospital sudden death in
San Francisco County which has thus far collected extensive tissue samples from numerous tissues including
brain, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, gut, heart, pulmonary vasculature, lung parenchyma, pancreas, and bone
marrow from >1,000 SCD victims. We also leverage our ongoing prospective tissue biopsy program through
the UCSF LIINC study to collect blood, PBMC, gut tissue, lymph node aspirates and bone marrow in people
with prior COVID-19. The unique, direct access to human represents an unprecedented opportunity to examine
the human virome across organ systems in a broad survey of ambulatory adults to uncover mechanisms that
facilitate viral persistence but also may lead to immune dysregulation or subclinical inflammation. This highly
innovative project involves in situ hybridization, cutting-edge tissue-based transcriptomic/proteomic profiling,
metagenomics virome sequencing, and ultra-high multiplexed immuno-histochemical platforms. Our aims are
to: (1) Test the hypothesis that the human tissue virome in otherwise healthy persons is heterogeneously
distributed in various anatomical and immune-privileged regions, across the lifespan, and by sex assigned at
birth. We will accomplish this by determining the anatomical, histological, and cellular tropism of the human
virome in adults in relatively good health dying suddenly out-of-hospital. (2) Test the hypothesis that the tissue
virome is dependent on host gene, protein and immune responses across tissues that facilitate persistence.
We further hypothesize that the virome requires escape from or adaptation to innate and adaptive immune
responses which allow viral persistence, but also may lead to immune modulation or sub-clinical tissue
inflammation. (3) Establish an innovative pilot research grant award program to support collaborative, cutting
edge research involving tissue-based studies to foster interest and development in novel ways to characterize
the virome and impact on host responses across the whole body, a key component of the Human Virome
Project."

 Our long-term goal has been to characterize the heterogeneous group of chronic lower airway diseases
(LAD) observed in World Trade Center (WTC) workers and volunteers, uncover their risk factors and
comorbidities, identify subgroups with adverse and favorable lung function trajectories and outcomes, deploy
novel imaging approaches to the investigation of the underlying lung injury, and improve surveillance and
prevention strategies.
 Our previous research suggests the differential adverse effects and imaging characteristics of the
longitudinal lung function trajectories of the WTC workers, and markers suggesting early chronic disabling lung
disease. We thus propose to test the use of added respiratory surveillance tools and explore functional
markers of disease progression, explore alternate methods to investigate longitudinal functional trajectories,
and novel spirometry calibration methods that might facilitate the implementation of spirometry in
nonspecialized settings.
 This project will be conducted in the occupational cohort followed at Mount Sinai, among the WTC
Pulmonary Evaluation Unit Chest CT Imaging Archive subcohort members still on active health surveillance.
This group of 1710 WTC workers has detailed disease symptom, both pre-WTC and WTC-related
occupational exposure, longitudinal spirometry measurements and body weight trends, visual chest CT
imaging classification and grading, and quantitative computer tomography (QCT) measurements of airway,
body composition, and pulmonary parenchymal and vascular abnormalities."

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to double over the next 20
years. Ethnic and racial minorities will bear a disproportionate burden of disease with the most staggering
increase of nearly six-fold anticipated among Mexican Americans and other Hispanic groups. Nonetheless, there
is marked variability in cognitive trajectories, and approximately two-thirds of Mexican Americans surviving into
their 80’s will remain dementia-free. The variability in outcomes highlights the influence of risk and resilience
factors, which may alter neurodegenerative disease course. Recent studies have suggested that upwards of
40% of all dementia cases may be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors. Among these, the data
supporting the protective benefits of lifestyle factors, such as physical, cognitive, and social activity engagement,
are so compelling that the nation’s leading health organizations have adopted these findings as
recommendations for attenuating ADRD risk. However, the protective effects of lifestyle factors in Mexican
Americans, which may interact with socioeconomic factors, comorbid disease burden, genetic loading, and
cultural factors, warrants further investigation. Assessment of activity engagement has typically relied on self-
report, which is prone to inaccuracies due to the fallibility of memory, social desirability biases, and the limited
frequency of evaluation, negating more nuanced understanding of behavioral change in response to common
fluctuations in environmental and individual factors. Our team at Oregon Health & Science University has
validated the Collaborative Aging Research using Technology (CART) platform, which is comprised of an
integrated network of in-home monitoring devices that capture high-density multi-modal data and are coupled
with algorithms to derive activity patterns that predict cognitive decline. Through a partnership with The University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, we have extended the technology to the homes of 5 Mexican
American older adults. We now propose to expand upon this line of research and leverage the CART platform
to continuously monitor real-world physical, cognitive, and social activity patterns across a three-year period in
a cohort of 120 older Mexican Americans adults (Aim 1a). We will further evaluate the modifying effects of
socioeconomic status, acculturation, sex, depression, cardiovascular burden, and apolipoprotein ε4 status (Aim
1b). Next, we will explore the associations between activity engagement and traditional and novel neuroimaging
indices of brain aging and ADRD (Aim 2). Finally, we will examine the inflammatory profile associated with
activity engagement, as well as their associations with cognitive decline and neuroimaging outcomes (Aim 3).
Leveraging the innovative CART technology platform, we will identify the activity engagement patterns that
promote risk and resilience of cognitive decline in a high-risk, understudied ethnic group. Results of the study
will identify multidimensional health determinants and inflammatory pathways that shape cognitive trajectories,
providing insights into targeted ADRD prevention and treatment strategies within this growing population."

The recent outbreak of keratitis caused by an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strain of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa with blaVIM-80 and blaGES-9 associated with preservative free artificial tears is concerning
because the infecting bacteria was resistant to all tested antibiotics currently used to treat bacterial keratitis. As
of May 2023 the CDC and other health departments had reported 81 patients in 18 states infected with this
strain. Of these, 14 cases of vision loss associated with this infection had been recorded (a rate of 17.3%),
including four cases of enucleation. Of great concern is that four patients have died within 30 days of culture
collection. This progression to loss of the globe secondary to keratitis is extremely atypical as microbial
keratitis rarely progresses to endophthalmitis. For instance, only 0.5% of microbial keratitis cases resulted in
endophthalmitis in a recent large-scale study. In addition, our preliminary data, based on whole genome
sequencing of the outbreak strain, in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing, and rabbit keratitis studies, suggests
that this strain has unique qualities that contribute to its pathogenesis. This includes extremely high resistance
to standard of care antibiotics, the ability to survive and proliferate beyond typical strains in vivo, and an
unusual virulence factor armament. The outbreak isolate groups phylogenetically with “cytotoxic” strains, but
lacks type III secretion system (T3SS) toxins associated with cytotoxic or invasive strains. Such atypical strains
that lack T3SS toxins represent 25% of keratitis isolates, yet have not been studied to investigate other
virulence mechanisms that they employ.
 Because of the critical threat to vision caused by this strain and the lack of a good treatment approach,
the objective of this study is to identify the mechanisms underlying the enhanced virulence of the outbreak
strain, and to develop better therapeutic approaches to treat ocular infections caused by this XDR P.
aeruginosa strain. The long-term objective is to generate mechanistic and translational information that can
lead to antivirulence and antibiotic strategies in order to save vision from infections caused by this and future
highly drug resistant bacterial infections of the eye. A major goal of this study will be to systematically test
these and other candidate virulence factors unique to this outbreak strain in establishing keratitis and keratitis
outcomes (Aim 1). A second goal will be to mitigate the threat of this strain by testing FDA approved
antimicrobials and combinations not currently used in the eye (Aim 2). Based on our intriguing preliminary data
and the impetus of this new pathogenic threat, we are poised to test the hypothesis that this outbreak strain is
a new type of keratitis-causing P. aeruginosa, neither classically cytotoxic or invasive, that uses different
virulence factors to establish infection.
This study can have long-term impacts on the field by 1) providing information to help uncover why this strain
concerningly appears to have the ability to spread from the cornea to deeper ocular tissues and cause life
threatening systemic infections that can inform future anti-virulence strategies, and 2) development of more
effective ocular antibiotic formulations that could be used to treat XDR bacterial infections. Furthermore, our
team is uniquely situated to make rapid advances in understanding this form of keratitis based on our
experience and having an active animal model of this disease demonstrating our ability to discern clinically
relevant differences in virulence and antibiotic efficacy."

 The HIV/AIDS associated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is responsible for 20% of
global HIV-related mortality and has been designated on the World Health Organization Critical Fungal Patho-
gens list. Cn is the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis (CM), a severe infection of the central nervous
system that causes irreversible neurological damage and death. Mortality rates from CM are >30% depending
upon global region. To reduce global mortality from CM, a greater understanding of host immune responses
and better in vivo models are needed to produce clinically translatable findings. Cn is found ubiquitously in the
environment and inhalation of Cn spores leads to infection of the alveoli and deep pulmonary tissue. In immu-
nocompetent individuals, Cn infection is contained within pulmonary granulomas leading to containment of Cn
cells. Granulomas are formed through signaling between the innate and adaptive immune responses, specifi-
cally between macrophages and CD4+ T cells. Advanced HIV coinfection causes depletion of CD4+ T cells
and disrupts the signaling needed to maintain granuloma structure. Granuloma breakdown leads to fungal es-
cape and disseminated CM disease. Better understanding of granuloma formation and breakdown can lead to
the development of therapeutics to prevent dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. However, cur-
rent in vivo models do not replicate human the necrotic Cn granulomas observed in humans. My preliminary
data identified C3HeB/FeJ mice as producing Cn granulomas that better recapitulate necrotic granulomas in
humans. In addition, these mice have better survival when infected with Cn compared to C57Bl/6 (B6) mice.
However, the mechanism and genes that drive this phenotype are unknown. Previous studies using Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (Tb) showed that deficiencies in the immune regulating gene Sp140 is involved in the
C3HeB/FeJ necrotic granuloma response against Tb. Therefore, my central hypothesis is that sp140-deficieny
is responsible for the production of necrotic Cn granulomas and increased resistance against Cn. To test my
hypothesis I propose the following Aims: Aim 1) Determine the role of sp140-deficiency in the immune re-
sponse against Cn by measuring differences in survival, fungal burden, Cn blood antigen level, cytokine abun-
dances, and immune cell populations; Aim 2) Define the histological and transcriptional profiles of sp140-defi-
cient Cn granulomas over time using microscopy and spatial transcriptomics, and determine the mechanisms
by which CD4+ T cell depletion leads to granuloma breakdown. These findings will expand our understanding
of protective host immune responses against Cn, establish a method for modeling human-like Cn granulomas
in mice, and provide insight into the mechanism of granuloma degradation during advanced HIV coinfection."

Although both men and women are affected by alcohol use disorder (AUD), women often progress through
AUD disease milestones faster and experience more severe health consequences than men. One key brain

drinking behaviors. Previous findings from our lab demonstrate that parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory
interneurons (PV-INs), a key subpopulation of GABAergic cells within PFC, display basal sex differences in
membrane physiology and undergo sex-dependent adaptations in synaptic strength following chronic drinking.
In recent years, the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor subtype 5 has emerged as a promising
therapeutic target for the treatment of AUD. The mGlu5 receptor is highly expressed on PFC PV-INs and has
been implicated in mediating ethanol seeking across several rodent models of AUD. However, limited clinical
success of compounds that inhibit mGlu5 receptors necessitates a more precise understanding of the circuits
and synaptic mechanisms through which mGlu5 receptors regulate drinking behaviors. My preliminary data
suggests that mGlu5 receptors sex-dependently regulate synaptic transmission and endocannabinoid plasticity
onto PFC PV-INs. In this proposal I will use ex vivo slice electrophysiology, viral-mediated optogenetic tools,
and RNAscope to test the hypothesis that distinct excitatory inputs onto PV-INs are regulated by mGlu5
receptor signaling, and that chronic drinking functionally alters these inputs and mGlu5 receptor
function. This proposal will specifically assess glutamatergic afferents from the basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), which preferentially target PV-INs to drive robust feedforward inhibition in
the PFC. In both human and animal studies, acute and chronic ethanol exposure alters glutamate transmission
in the BLA and MDT. However, differences in subcellular localization and expression of CB1 receptors may
suggest that each of these excitatory inputs have different functions at PFC PV-INs from male and female
mice. In Aim 1, I will determine whether mGlu5 receptors regulate excitatory transmission (1.1) and
endocannabinoid plasticity (1.2) at BLA and MDT synapses on PFC PV-INs in a sex-specific manner. In Aim 2,
I will determine whether chronic drinking sex-dependently alters BLA and MDT synaptic strength (2.1) and
mGlu5 receptor signaling on PFC PV-INs (2.2). Preliminary data indicate female (but not male) mice with a
genetic deletion of mGlu5 from PV+ cells drink less when provided IA ethanol. In Aim 3, I will determine
whether PFC PV-INs mediate binge-drinking in PV-mGlu5-/- mice. The results of these experiments will improve
our understanding of the molecular components underlying ethanol-induced adaptations in synaptic plasticity
at specific PFC inputs and may direct therapeutic interventions for the treatment of AUD. By completing this
proposal, I will have strengthened my technical skills, enhanced my knowledge, and received professional
development necessary for my success as an independent investigator in the field of alcohol research."
10996462,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 50% of adults in the United States have at least one chronic disease, and minority populations
have a disparate burden compared to individuals of non-minoritized racial identities. Early diagnosis and
intervention are key features of precision medicine initatives, which must first overcome heterogeneity among
risk factors, including sex differences and social determinants of health. Despite the development of ancestry-
informed genomic analyses, which can be applied to determine ancestry-driven genetic susceptibility for disease
risk in diverse populations, recently admixed individuals of African ancestry are underrepresented in genetic
studies targeted to identify risk factors for chronic disease. Moreover, few genetic studies are positioned to
examine the modifying effects of social determinants of health on genetic risk for chronic disease, which can
result in inflated estimates of genetic effect and thus further impinge on precision medicine initiatives in recently
admixed individuals of African ancestry. The utilization of ancestry-informed genomic analyses and integration
of ancestry-driven genomic discoveries in precision medicine initiatives is paramount for the accuracy and
innovation in treating chronic disease. This proposal details the ways in which I, Ms. Kimberlyn Ellis, will fill these
detrimental gaps through my doctoral and anticipated postdoctoral research. In Specific Aim 1 (The
Dissertation Research Project), I will investigate the interactions between genetic variation, genetic ancestry,
and known social and structural risk factors in the context of electronic health record data using asthma as a
well-characterized and comprehensive proof-of-principle chronic disease phenotype. In Specific Aim 2 (The
Postdoctoral Research Direction), I will conduct a landscape analysis of current genomic-driven precision
medicine initiatives, including the ethical, legal, and social implications of the current inequalities. After narrowing
my focus to the initiatives that are most disparate for non-European populations, I will develop and assess a list
of policy priorities related to integrating ancestry-informed genomics into these initiatives. The proposed studies
will greatly diversify and advance the field of genomics in two important ways. First, they will provide a rigorous
framework for elucidating the poorly understood relationships between genetic ancestry, social determinants of
health, and chronic disease for recently admixed populations with African ancestry. Second, they will provide
guidelines and recommendations for implementing ancestry-informed genomics in large-scale clinical settings,
creating just and equitable precision medicine advancements for underrepresented groups. Moreover, the
completion of these aims and funding from this award will be imperative to my ultimate goal of building an
impactful career as an independent researcher seeking to break down scientific silos and foster cross-sector
collaboration towards inclusive genomic efforts."
10979084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) immune mediated necrotizing myopathy
(IMNM) is an increasingly recognized, severe subset of autoimmune myopathy that causes significant muscle
weakness, morbidity, and often permanent physical disability. Randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) data
on anti-HMGCR IMNM treatment are highly limited, and no treatment trials specifically of anti-HMGCR IMNM
have been completed to date. This lack of placebo-controlled interventional trial data is a critical barrier to
improving outcomes for anti-HMGCR IMNM patients and represents an increasingly urgent research gap as
the number of anti-HMGCR IMNM patients increases. Recent observational evidence strongly suggests that
intravenously administered pooled human immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be particularly effective in treating anti-
HMGCR IMNM. Corroboration of these data via a placebo-controlled trial is a fundamental next step towards
establishing the role of IVIG as an effective treatment for anti-HMGCR IMNM. In addition, understanding of anti-
HMGCR IMNM immuno-pathogenesis and its response to immunomodulatory therapy, such as IVIG, is limited.
Overcoming this second knowledge gap would also facilitate identification of effective therapies. Our group’s
data suggest that HMGCR-specific CD4+ T cells may play an important role in anti-HMGCR IMNM disease
propagation.
 Our overarching goal is to conduct a pilot, exploratory clinical trial to test the central hypothesis that
IVIG is an effective treatment for HMGCR myopathy in improving both key clinical outcomes and immunologic
markers of disease pathogenesis. Our multidisciplinary team will innovatively combine clinical and translational
approaches to generate urgently needed placebo-controlled data on the initial clinical efficacy of IVIG in anti-
HMGCR IMNM and to determine the relationships of HMGCR-specific CD4+ T cells with disease activity and
response to immunomodulatory therapy. This proposal is responsive to PAR-21-045 which calls for exploratory
clinical trials in autoimmune and musculoskeletal conditions.
 There are two Aims. The goal of Aim 1 (RCT) is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and initial efficacy
of IVIG for anti-HMGCR IMNM in a phase 2, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that will provide critical pilot
data towards a future phase 3 trial. The goal of Aim 2 (T cell immunology) is to determine whether immunologic
features of HMGCR-specific CD4+ T cells (prevalence, effector function, and epitope specificity) 1) are
biomarkers of disease activity and 2) are affected by IVIG in anti-HMGCR IMNM."
10978693,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The sudden loss of smell and taste are among the defining features of COVID-19 that set it apart from other
viral respiratory syndromes with an incidence of up to 70% with some SARSCoV2 variants. Importantly, in
some patients smell and taste disturbances persist for longer than 12 months after recovery from COVID-19.
Furthermore, classical anti-inflammatory treatment therapies are ineffective for COVID19 chemosensory
dysfunction. To inform targeted treatments, it is critical to elucidate the specific pathways that lead to persistent
disruption of chemosensory function. Our preliminary data show that persistent COVID19 chemosensory
dysfunction involves persistently disordered neuroepithelial composition and infiltration with immune cells with
features of immunosuppressive macrophages. The dysregulated inflammatory milieu prominently features
linoleic acid metabolites and glioma-associated proteins with direct effect on olfactory stem cell proliferation
and differentiation and olfactory sensory neuron survival. This study will determine how the inflammatory but
steroid-resistant immune cells drive chemosensory dysfunction that plagues patients with persistent COVID19
disruption of smell and taste. In Aim 1 we will define the phenotype of the infiltrating immune cells using both
transcriptional and mediator studies. In Aim 2, we will determine how immune mediators defined in Aim 1
disrupt olfactory stem cell and sensory neuron development and apoptosis trajectories using a mouse in vitro
system and relate these findings to the disordered epithelial composition of subjects with persistent COVID19
chemosensory dysfunction. Thus, we use complementary approaches with molecular tools and cell systems
and samples from carefully phenotyped human subjects. The studies should reveal new potential strategies for
therapeutic development that are based on the novel underlying mechanism that we identified here."

10983000,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Young people living with HIV (LWH) in the developmental periods from adolescence to
emerging adulthood (ages 16-28 years), which we refer to as “youth and emerging adults” (YEA), have the
lowest rates of engagement along the HIV care continuum (HCC) of any age group. This poor engagement is
most pronounced for African American/Black and Latinx YEA-LWH, including sexual/gender minorities, those
who use alcohol/drugs, and individuals from low socioeconomic status backgrounds. Yet, our knowledge of
factors that promote or impede engagement along the HCC, and how they operate and interplay over time, is
insufficient, for both limited occurrence behaviors (e.g., HIV care appointments) and repeated occurrence
behaviors (e.g., ART adherence). These gaps limit innovations to policy and health services. The proposed
prospective longitudinal study uses mixed methods and focuses on African American/Black and Latinx YEA-
LWH both with and without viral suppression. The study uses quantitative, qualitative, biomarker (HIV viral
load, drug use), and ecological momentary assessment approaches to uncover, describe, and better
understand factors contributing to trajectories of engagement along the HCC over time, with precision,
including from YEA-LWH’s perspectives. The study is grounded in Social Action Theory, a comprehensive
social-cognitive/ecological model that allows for examination of changes in contextual influences (e.g., action
contexts such as racism and homophobia; self-regulatory resources such as substance use), self-change
processes (e.g., social interaction processes including social networks; motivational appraisals), and action
states (e.g., attendance at HIV care appointments, substance use treatment [as needed], ART re-initiation).
The study’s primary outcome is HIV viral suppression (VS). Two interconnected aims are proposed: to
describe trajectories of engagement along the HCC (Aim 1), and guided by Social Action Theory, to identify,
describe, and understand the contextual influences, self-change processes, and action states that impede or
support the behaviors that comprise engagement along the HCC over time, including YEA-LWH’s
perspectives on these factors (Aim 2). A Youth Advisory Board will be joined by scientific advisors to develop
actionable recommendations based on study findings, which will be disseminated. Participants (N=270, half
with HIV VS and half non-suppressed at enrollment) will be diverse African American/Black or Latinx
behaviorally infected YEA-LWH recruited in New York City and Newark, NJ using a proven hybrid strategy. We
will follow participants prospectively for 18 months using mixed methods, combining baseline and follow-up
data (N ≈ 810 viral load observations), to assess the multifaceted domains expected to facilitate or impede
engagement along the HCC, and YEA-LWH’s perspectives on their causes and meanings. The research team
is expert in longitudinal mixed methods studies, HCC research, and AABL YEA. The proposed study aligns
with NIH priorities and will advance solutions for this serious public health problem."
10987559,"Project Summary/Abstract:
A key step in the assembly of the large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses is packaging of a genome into a
pre-assembled procapsid by an ATP-driven motor complex. In the herpesviruses and many bacteriophages,
packaging is catalyzed by a terminase enzyme that utilizes a concatemeric genome substrate. To accomplish
this, terminase enzymes assemble into distinct initiation, motor and termination complexes to processively excise
an individual genome from the concatemer, and concomitantly package it into the capsid. This requires that the
enzymes cycle between stable nuclease and dynamic motor intermediates. While our understanding of
packaging initiation and motor translocation is extensive, termination of genome packaging remains ill-studied
and poorly characterized in all viruses, primarily because defined experimental systems have not been
developed. Phage  is an exception wherein rigorous biochemical assays allow molecular dissection of the
entire assembly pathway. This multi-PI application proposes to use phage  to interrogate termination, the final
and most poorly characterized step in the packaging pathway. Two fundamental questions central to genome
packaging are addressed; (i) how does the translocating motor recognize the genome end while also sensing
that a sufficient length of DNA has been packaged, transition to a site-specifically bound nuclease complex, and
(ii) how do “finishing proteins” promote end maturation and terminase ejection from the nucleocapsid without
loss of the tightly packaged DNA. We describe highly integrated and synergistic biochemical, biophysical, single-
molecule and structural approaches to characterize this conserved and essential, yet largely unstudied step in
virus assembly. Given that this process is strongly conserved in all of the dsDNA viruses, both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic, and the commonality of initiation-translocation-termination pathways in biology, the results will have
broad implications in virology and cell biology."
10984706,"High concentrations of inspired oxygen are necessary during treatment of critically ill patients with impaired lung
function, such as those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, studies in animal models
show that hyperoxia may further exacerbate pulmonary inflammation and compound lung injury. Four-day
exposure of C57BL/6 mice to FiO2>90% leads to diffuse alveolar damage and immune cell infiltration of the
lungs, inclusive of NKT cells and neutrophils. We recently discovered that experimental hyperoxia is associated
with profound loss of pulmonary B cells. Such B cell depletion has also been reported in patients with ARDS.
We now show that adoptive transfer of naïve B cells during hyperoxic exposure not only addresses the B cell
depletion but also limits neutrophil infiltration and decreases the severity of lung injury. Our central hypothesis
for this novel line of investigation is that hyperoxia impacts pulmonary B cell numbers and/or regulatory functions
provoking inflammation. The corollary is that this process can be reversed, and lung injury mitigated by
administration of naïve B cells. We propose that strategies preserving or augmenting B cell numbers in the lungs
could promote immune regulation and mitigate infiltration with inflammatory cell subsets (e.g., NKT cells,
neutrophils) during hyperoxia. In Aim 1, we will characterize the dynamics of B cell responses during hyperoxia
and examine the protective impacts of B cell supplementation. We will also test whether protective effects of
exogenous B cells are mediated by IL-10 or other factors. In Aim 2, we will study mechanistic interactions
between protective B cells and pathogenic NKT cells during hyperoxia as mediated via the autotaxin-
lysophosphatidic acid pathway. We will test whether deletion of NKT cells or inhibition of autotaxin functions
improve B cell numbers in the lungs and/or otherwise enhance protective effects of adoptive B cell
immunotherapy. This R03 award will provide new data on the regulatory role of B cells in hyperoxic lung injury
and ensure essential support to PI Dr. Hanidziar on his path to become an independent, R01 funded investigator."
10984707,"Project Abstract
Globally, nearly 300,000 people die from hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver diseases, most of them in
developing nations with poor resources. Until the recent COVID pandemic, hepatitis C virus is also one of the
leading cause of death in the US by infection. WHO aims to eliminate HCV deaths by 2030. This ambitious goal
can only be achieved if HCV infected patients with severe liver disease, including liver cancer, can be diagnosed
and treated rapidly. The current gold standard, for HCV diagnostics for both developing and developed countries,
is a point-of-care (POC) host antibody test, based on saliva sample or finger prick blood sample, followed by a
lab-bound reverse-transcription PCR estimate of the viral RNA (load). The first test does not indicate active
infection that should be treated. This is determined by the second viral load test, which also determines the
severity of the infection and the selection of proper treatment or more invasive diagnosis. The key obstacle to
successfully diagnosing and treating HCV infected patients with liver diseases in the developing world is the
second PCR test for viral load. There are very few laboratories for such tests and mail delivery of blood samples
is not feasible in a country with low resource. Many patients that tested positive by the POC antibody test do
not or cannot travel to the laboratories for the PCR and antigen tests.
This proposal aims to integrate two technologies with a smart-phone imaging device to provide a 30-minute one-
step POC assay with untreated blood that can quantify viral load and determine the specific liver disease. It is
based on a Janus microparticle assay that has the sensitivity of the PCR test but requires much less personnel
attention and is much more rapid. Its rapidity (30 minutes) is partly because sample prep is unnecessary. As its
signal can only be provided by the virus, rather than its RNA (or protein), only a rapid ultrafiltration step is required
to enrich the virus. The PIs have developed such an ultrafiltration technology for extracellular vesicles (EVs).
Since the HCV virus is the same size as the EVs, this ultrafiltration technology will be developed for virus and
integrated with the Janus particle assay to provide a one-step POC viral load quantification platform.
The direct virus assay reduces the sample volume so that capillary drawn blood sample is adequate. The only
instrumentation needed for the POC platform is a portable smart-phone based imaging system. Upon completion
of this R21 project, a business partner Aopia will design integrated prototypes that can process multiple samples
for a major clinical trial after the funding period."
10984732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer remains the most lethal cancer in the United States, with its diagnosis often hindered by delays.
The complexity of these delays stems from a patient's diagnostic journey that spans across multiple care
systems. In many instances, key decision-influencing factors are unrecorded, and medical records frequently
miss essential elements of the patient's experience. Recognizing this, the focus of my career development and
current research proposal is to undertake a multi-faceted analysis utilizing a mixed-methods approach to
characterize the lung cancer diagnostic journey, incorporating both physicians' and patients' perspectives to
construct a comprehensive narrative of the diagnostic process. The project will answer key questions:
Q1: How does the diagnostic process begin?
Q2: How do patients progress from presentation to diagnosis?
Q3: How long does the diagnostic process take?
Q4: Are there risks or harms associated with a prolonged diagnostic process?
Q5: Are minority patients at a higher risk of experiencing extended diagnosis durations and/or associated harm?
Q6: Do healthcare use patterns suggest earlier diagnosis could be possible?
Q7: Could anything has been done differently to reach the correct diagnosis sooner?
The proposed research project will develop novel measurement and intervention strategies to prevent lung
cancer diagnostic delay and harm by generating novel insights about patients' journeys toward lung cancer
diagnosis. We seek to apply the Theory of Constraints paradigm to identify the weakest links in the diagnostic
process chain for lung cancer. Leveraging data from the Johns Hopkins Health System, we will (1) measure
delays in patient, provider, and system time intervals for the lung cancer diagnostic journey; (2) estimate
associated harms and health disparities, and identify if certain clinical presentations were more likely to be
missed or lead to diagnostic delay; and (3) conduct in-depth mixed-methods case reviews, provider input, and
patient interviews to identify obstacles that could impact diagnostic performance and patients' health outcomes.
This study will yield novel insights that answer the seven key questions above related to lung cancer diagnosis.
These answers will inform subsequent efforts to prevent avoidable harm due to lung cancer diagnostic delay
more broadly in Maryland as well as nationally. The proposed study and training activities will uniquely position
me to launch a career as an independent investigator developing and testing potential intervention strategies to
improve lung cancer diagnostic safety. I anticipate a pilot intervention study during the follow-on R01 phase."
10984158,"Project Summary:
Reproduction is energetically demanding and as a result, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis is
tightly regulated by metabolic factors. However, the specific neural circuitry underlying the interaction between
metabolic and reproductive state remains incompletely understood. The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) plays
a critical role in the bi-directional communication between metabolic state and reproductive function, and the
utility of the MC3R to address reproductive disorders is untested. The MC3R is ideally positioned both
anatomically and functionally, to mediate direct communication between metabolic state and the reproductive
axis. MC3R is expressed in nearly 100% of the AgRP neurons, the primary neurons of the central melanocortin
system, as well as in secondary target sites of the melanocortin system, such as the kisspeptin neurons.
Furthermore, female mice lacking MC3R exhibit altered reproductive cycle lengths and do not suppress
reproductive cycles in response to fasting. Both mice and humans with MC3R mutations show delays in
pubertal onset, demonstrating the highly conserved role of this receptor. Our preliminary data show that male
MC3RKO mice are significantly delayed in pubertal onset, whereas female MC3RKO mice have a delay to first
estrus. Hypothalamic MC3R expression follows a sexually dimorphic pattern in both mice and humans,
however sex differences in MC3R control of reproductive function have not been explored. For example, little is
known about the role of this receptor in the physiology and pathophysiology of HPG axis control. In this
application, I will study the neuroendocrine role of MC3R in the physiology and pathophysiology of HPG axis
control. The principal investigator in this training grant, Dr. Danielle Porter, has extensive experience in
reproductive neuroendocrinology and neuroanatomy. In this training grant, Dr. Porter will receive additional
training in metabolic physiology and pharmacology from the primary research mentor, Dr. Roger Cone.
Furthermore, under the guidance of an expert team of collaborators, Dr. Porter will receive hands on training in
whole brain imaging and further training in neuroendocrinology. Together, the mentorship and training in this
K99/R00 application will provide the necessary technical and conceptual background for Dr. Porter to initiate
an independent research program focusing on MC3R neural circuits as therapeutic targets for disorders at the
interface of reproduction and metabolism."

The recent interest in developing alternatives to traditional antibiotics are driving timely investments that are
urgently needed to confront the growing antimicrobial resistance crisis. Fortuitously, the burgeoning microbial
genomics era has revitalized efforts to explore natural products (NPs) as key sources of new antibiotics and their
alternatives. However, tapping NPs as therapeutics requires a sophisticated understanding of biosynthetic
mechanisms, the instructions of which are frequently encoded within discrete biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs).
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a diverse class of NPs that are widely produced across evolution, are intensively
being researched as an antibiotic alternative, especially because AMPs rapidly kill bacteria and that resistance
to AMPs has been slow to emerge. Here, we aim to build upon the recent discovery of an AMP family, of which
the corresponding BGC is unlike previously recognized BGCs for AMPs. Moreover, this AMP family and its BGC
are widespread throughout diverse bacteria, which represents a rich resource of AMPs to exploit for future
therapeutic development. Thus, to advance these efforts, the overarching goal of this project is to dissect the
mechanisms of this novel BGC that leads to AMP production. Using a combination of molecular biology
techniques, bacterial genetic approaches, and biochemical assays, we will focus on ascribing roles of the BGC
components to 1) biosynthetic events that yield the mature AMP product and 2) the regulatory phenomena that
may be needed to balance AMP yield against fitness costs to the producer. Our results will provide key
knowledge that will serve as the basis for future sophisticated biochemical examinations, empower genome
mining and bioengineering of this AMP class, advance future efforts that seek to optimize yields for cost-effective
manufacturing of this AMP family in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical studies, and in designing
strategies to prevent or subvert the rise of resistance to this AMP family."
10983896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a major public health challenge, responsible for approximately 30% of
strokes and at least 40% of dementia cases. cSVD is a major vascular pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and vascular cognitive impairment manifesting as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in leptomeningeal
surface and penetrating arteries and arterioles (LPAs) of the cortex and as arteriosclerosis in lenticulostriate
arteries (LSAs) in the subcortex, respectively. Based on routine neuroimaging methods, we are unable to
directly visualize these vital cerebral small vessels (CSVs), however, we observe their downstream effects on
clinical MRI as cSVD, which manifests as parenchymal vascular brain injuries such as lacunes and other small
infarcts, white matter hyperintensities, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVSs). In the
absence of a routine neuroimaging technique to directly visualize the CSVs, there is a need to better
understand the functional status of these blood vessels to broaden our understanding of these disorders with
the promise of early prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment. The proposed research will help to fill
this scientific gap by studying arterial pulsatility, an established index of vascular dysfunction. Increased arterial
pulsatility of CSVs induces higher vessel wall shear stress and the possibility of endothelial dysfunction and
damage, leakage of the blood brain barrier, and reduced tissue cerebral blood flow (CBF). Increased pulsatility
(or reduced vessel wall pulsations) of CSVs could also be associated with a reduction in cerebrospinal fluid-
interstitial fluid (CSF-ISF) exchange resulting in the deposition of toxic waste product in PVSs, which would
eventually result in WMH and/or enlargement of PVSs. Therefore, cerebral microvascular pulsatility may play
an important role in the pathophysiology of cSVD. Recently, submillimeter resolution 7T MRI has demonstrated
the capability of directly characterizing the hemodynamics and pulsatility of deep cerebral perforating arteries.
However, the widespread use of 7T MRI remains limited due to its high cost, limited availability, and inherent
technical challenges. To facilitate broader applicability in both clinical and research settings, this research
project proposes to develop two advanced MRI techniques to directly assess cerebral microvascular pulsatility
on widely assessable 3T MRI and evaluate cerebral microvascular pulsatility in cSVD by investigating its
relationship with the global burden of cSVD as an MRI biomarker of brain parenchymal injury. The successful
completion of this project will yield two complementary MRI imaging tools for the direct assessment of cerebral
microvascular pulsatility on widely available 3T MRI, which will further our knowledge of how cerebral micro-
vessel dysfunction may contribute to cSVD and provide a clinically relevant and useful novel diagnostic
technology for understanding cSVD."
10983555,"Permanent disabilities following axonal injuries result from the failure of injured axons to regenerate and rebuild functional connections. Controlling axon regeneration is highly relevant to the development of therapeutic strategies for nervous system repair. Most axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) fail to regenerate after injury, whereas axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can regenerate. Interestingly, serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the CNS have an atypical capacity for axonal regrowth after injury. However, the intrinsic molecular mechanisms underlying 5-HT axon regeneration are not understood. It seems likely that elucidating these mechanisms will help to explain why 5-HT neurons are exceptional in the ability to regenerate connectivity. Recently, we showed that two transcription factors, Lmx1b and Pet1, control a 5-HT axonal growth program during a development and an axonal maintenance program in adult 5-HT neurons. These findings led me to hypothesize that Lmx1b and Pet1 may also be required to control a distinct intrinsic axonal regeneration program in injured adult 5-HT neurons. Interestingly, my preliminary in vivo results showed that adult-stage Lmx1b and Pet1 deficiency inhibits serotonergic regeneration. Thus, in this proposal I will investigate the following broad question: Do Lmx1b and Pet1 control a distinct axonal regeneration transcriptional program? To address this question, I will (1) investigate adult-stage Lmx1b and Pet1 function in the regeneration of 5-HT axons and synapses, (2) investigate the transcriptomic and chromatin mechanisms underlying 5-HT axon regeneration, and (3) investigate Lmx1b and Pet1 function in the regulation of an adult- stage 5-HT regeneration program. My long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms that can enable axons regenerate after injury and use the insights to develop therapeutic strategies. 5-HT neurons provide a unique opportunity to investigate the intrinsic mechanisms that enable axonal regrowth after injury. As my primary expertise is in Biochemistry and Genetics, my proposal studies bring me significant changes from my previous expertise and enable me to break into a new field of study, and acquire new techniques, including bioinformatical analyses, neuroimaging techniques, modified genetic tools, and behavior analysis. My career goal is to appropriately combine these techniques and scientific insights acquired though this K01 to clarify mechanisms underlying 5-HT axon regeneration, building a scientific career as an established researcher."
10986070,"Pandemic-period changes have been observed in recent rates for youth aged 10 to 14 on suicidal and 
non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (hereinafter referred to as SSIB), where they are now presenting with 
SSIB at rapidly increasing rates. This unique group of youth is of great interest, because SSIB prevention 
protocols are needed to reduce SSIB risk as well as decrease prevalence rates. Pediatric emergency 
departments (EDs) have become an essential and often routine mental health service for youth. EDs are 
optimal sites to initiate youth SSIB prevention protocol, as they are often the first point of entry for youth 
into the mental health system. Despite high rates of youth seen in the ED for SSIB, effective ED 
interventions to reduce SSIB risk and increase attendance and adherence to subsequent 
community-based mental health care are lacking. The purpose of this pilot study is to develop and pilot a 
Family Navigator (FN) with technology-enhanced information sharing via texting intervention for families 
with youth who were discharged from the ED after an admission for SSIB. This intervention aims to 
reduce SSIB risk and prevalence rates, as well as increase engagement in community-based mental 
health services for youth aged 10 to 14. This intervention is informed by the literature, evidence-based 
hospital intervention protocols, a family-based approach for youth development stages, and developed to 
directly target three mechanisms. This study will develop a brief FN modeling enhanced with 
technology-delivered information shared (automated sharing of information with families via text). Thus, 
qualitative methods will be employed to assist in the refinement of the intervention, thus maximizing 
ecological validity. At the outcome of this study, FN acceptability and feasibility as well as manual 
development will be completed. Balanced randomization will occur to either the treatment as usual (TAU) 
condition or the Family Navigator (FN) with information sharing condition. Primary outcomes, measured 
at 4- and 6-month follow-ups, include reduce SSIB risk and prevalence rates, increased attendance and 
adherence to youth community-based mental health care, and the engagement of the purported 
therapeutic mechanisms. This pilot study will set the stage for a NIMH R01 application via a Type I Hybrid 
Effectiveness-Implementation trial to speed translation of research findings to practice."
10983612,"Project Summary Introduction: Jason Coult, PhD, is a scientist whose career goal is to become an
independent computational investigator improving survival from out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest
(OHCA) through research of novel OHCA resuscitation technologies that incorporate clinical
understanding. His K01 proposal, “Artificial Intelligence to Improve Resuscitation following Out-of-Hospital
Cardiac Arrest”, seeks to develop smarter, deep learning-based defibrillator algorithms that can improve
OHCA survival by guiding personalized resuscitation treatment. Candidate: Dr. Coult is a recently-
appointed Research Assistant Professor at the University of Washington Department of Medicine. He
completed a PhD in bioengineering in 2019, and has expertise in signal processing, artificial intelligence
(AI), and OHCA research. Career development and mentorship: Dr. Coult has convened an
interdisciplinary team of mentors and advisors with expertise in animal and human clinical resuscitation,
cardiac electrophysiology, prehospital emergency medical services (EMS), AI and deep learning,
computational arrhythmia models, biostatistics, and defibrillators. The training plan cultivates necessary
skills in deep learning and biostatistics, advances understanding of clinical resuscitation, provides career
guidance, and facilitates Dr. Coult’s progression to become a successful independent investigator. The
proposed work will take place under Thomas Rea MD (primary mentor) at the University of Washington.
Proposed research: OHCA is a leading cause of mortality. Survival is possible though generally poor.
Resuscitation currently follows a fixed, one-size-fits-all protocol that requires CPR interruption at regular
intervals to determine the patient’s cardiac rhythm, assess vital status, and apply treatment. This research
will use large retrospective datasets of human OHCA defibrillator recordings, Dr. Coult’s expertise and
mentorship/advisory group, and emerging deep learning methods to achieve the following aims: 1) to
design deep learning-based AI algorithms that can identify the specific OHCA rhythm (asystole, ventricular
fibrillation (VF), organized rhythm) and estimate the “vitality” (morphologic phenotype associated with
clinical outcome) of these rhythms during ongoing CPR, 2) to characterize the effect of drug interventions
on measures of vitality, and 3) to apply rhythm and vitality features to predict shock-refractory VF patients
(requiring ≥ 3 shocks) during CPR, enabling preemptive antiarrhythmics or other strategies to mitigate
subsequent shock failure. Summary: The proposed research will advance resuscitation towards a
precision strategy that aligns treatment with an individual patient’s real-time physiology, providing the
potential to improve OHCA survival. The training and mentorship will foster the development of necessary
AI-related technical skills, deepen clinical understanding of OHCA and resuscitation, and help inform next-
step, R01-funded research, collectively supporting Dr. Coult’s transition to an independent investigator."

This application is for the renewal of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN)
clinical center at Saint Louis University and its pediatric component at Baylor University. The NASH Clinical
Research Network (NASH CRN) has been sponsored by the NIDDK since 2002 with renewals in 2009, 2014
and 2019. Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, previously called NAFLD) affects
more than one out of three adults and one out of five children the U.S. MASLD, and especially its most severe
subset, metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously called NASH), may lead to
cirrhosis and primary liver cancer resulting in death or liver transplant which contributes to substantial health
burdens and costs. The NASH CRN has been ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public
health significance of MASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. A primary objective
of the NASH CRN has been to perform clinical trials of therapeutic agents for MASH in adults and children. A
closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in MASH and MASLD
focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing
better means of diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and clinical management. In this final phase of the NASH
CRN, the adult vitamin E dosing trial (VEDS) initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed. The
longitudinal cohort Database-3 study of adults and children with MASLD will be wrapped up with closeout visits
in year 1 to provide a unique repository of data and samples from a well-phenotyped cohort that can be used in
future studies to prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk
factors, aid in biomarker discovery and validation to identify patients with at-risk MASH (MASH and at least
stage 2 fibrosis) and identify factors affecting disease progression. The Saint Louis University Clinical Center of
the NASH CRN will work collaboratively with the other clinical centers, SDCC and NIDDK to prioritize and
conduct studies of existing datasets over the final three years of funding. Proposed in this application is a
project for consideration that focuses on the role of the PNPLA3 I148M variant in sequestering and inactivating
a protein called ABHD5 or CGI58. Human variants of this protein are associated with progressive liver disease
and suppressed expression of this protein in rodents causes steatohepatitis. The underlying hypothesis is that
basis for the PNPLA3 I148M variant contributing to progressive liver disease is its role of ABHD5/CGI-58
sequestration rather than its putative role in lipid droplet triglyceride turnover. Whether this project is pursued
or other projects are given higher priority, the Saint Louis University clinical center will fully support the decision
of the steering committee with input from the NIDDK and devote its resources to the chosen projects. The
NASH CRN has had a major impact on the field and directly advances the mission of the National Institutes of
Health to improve the health of the public."

Noradrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms underlying pupil-linked arousal modulation of thalamic
sensory processing
Behavioral state, including attention and arousal, exerts heavy influences on neural representation, perception,
cognition, and behavioral performance and is regulated by several neuromodulatory systems, including the
locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system and the cholinergic system. Abnormal activity in the LC-NE
and cholinergic systems has been implicated in major clinical disorders that affect millions of people, including
schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease (PD), and depression. Non-luminance mediated changes in pupil size have
been known to co-vary with mental processing underlying behavior for decades. Recent work highlighted that
pupil dynamics were able to track rapid fluctuation of cortical arousal state. Therefore, changes in pupil size
under constant illumination have been widely used as a non-invasive read out of the activation of certain
central arousal circuits, and thus are used to index pupil-linked arousal. Atypical pupil dynamics have been
reported in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying modulation of
information processing in the brain by pupil-linked arousal remain little known. The proposed project will test
our central hypothesis: pupil-linked arousal modulates thalamic sensory processing and perceptual behavior
through both adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. We focus on the thalamus in this project because most
information about the external world reaches the cerebral cortex through the thalamus, and the thalamus plays
a critical role in gating information to the cortex. Using a synthesis of electrophysiology, genetic manipulations,
and behavioral paradigms, we will test this hypothesis in three Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characterization of the
extent to which thalamic sensory processing and its contribution to perception depend on pupil-linked arousal.
Aim 2 will examine the extent to which norepinephrine and acetylcholine (ACh) dynamics in the thalamus can
be tracked by pupil size. Aim 3 will develop cutting-edge genetic tools based on CRISPR/Cas9 + guide RNA
technology to selectively knock out each subtype of adrenergic and cholinergic receptor in the thalamus.
Further, we will characterize the role of each subtype of NE/Ach receptor in mediating pupil-linked arousal
modulation of sensory processing and perceptual behavior. This project will provide much-needed insight
about how the LC-NE and cholinergic systems contribute to pupil-linked arousal modulation of
thalamic processing of sensory information and perception. Such information is essential to better understand
neurological disorders in which abnormal thalamic activity and pupil dynamics have been reported."
10990473,"The controlled evolution of proteins in the laboratory is a valuable biomedical tool for accessing biomolecules for
industrial, therapeutic and research applications. This process, also known as directed evolution, allows one to
employ the specificity and selectivity that Nature imbues within its privileged biomolecules to construct unnatural
products that would otherwise be inefficient or laborious to generate chemosynthetically. While this process is
incredibly powerful, an existing bottleneck is the subsequent screening of the resulting variants for these high
value products. The directed evolution process typically generates hundreds to thousands of mutants or library
members for biochemical analysis. In some cases, fluorescent reporter systems or bioactivity assays can be
employed as a general biochemical readout, however, this does not inform on specific chemical transformations
towards diverse small molecule targets. When high value chemical products are the subject of these directed
evolution experiments, researchers employ multiple orthogonal analytical techniques, including: high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); gas chromatography (GC); mass spectrometry (MS); and nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). This becomes time and infrastructure intensive when thousands of variants need
to be evaluated; even if variants are pooled in curated groups, considerable effort is needed for chromatographic
assessment. Additionally, many of these methodologies may not be sensitive or specific enough to necessitate
detection of low titer production of the desired product(s). Based on these shortcomings of the screening
platforms, we are proposing to leverage our labs’ existing strengths to develop a high-throughput,
specific, and sensitive mass spectrometry platform to screen directed evolution libraries for bioactive
chemical products without chromatographic separation. The McKinnie lab has expertise in synthetic
chemistry and biochemistry and has specifically worked on the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme
to construct neuroactive kainic acid on the gram scale. The Sanchez lab has expertise in natural product
discovery and mass spectrometry techniques such as imaging mass spectrometry and tandem mass
spectrometry. These respective strengths will allow us to develop an innovative pipeline for screening thousands
of directed evolution library members to prioritize variants that direct the chemistry towards kainoid-ring
glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists. Our pipeline will allow for unprecedented measurements in
chemical specificity and be broadly applicable for any groups looking to conduct directed evolution.
● Current directed evolution screening platforms are time-consuming or low throughput
● The combined expertise of our team is highly interdisciplinary
● Mass spectrometry and trapped ion mobility spectrometry allow for high dimensionality
measurements directly from mutant colonies without reliance on chromatography techniques"

The most pressing challenge in oncology is the need for accurate biomarker-driven prognostic/predictive risk-
stratification to identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy early in
their treatment, as they might be better candidates for alternative therapies (e.g., genome-targeted agents,
immunotherapy). Unfortunately, only ~31% of eligible cancer patients achieve partial/complete response to
cytotoxic chemotherapy. For instance, over 40% of GB patients will inevitably recur within 6-8 months after
chemotherapy, suggesting that they could have been better candidates for newer experimental therapies. A
significant challenge in management of these patients is thus, segregating GB patients based on their
outcomes/response to treatment. Similarly, the aggressive chemoradiation protocol for rectal cancers results in
up to 70% of patients achieving 3-year disease-free survival. However, reliably determining which rectal cancer
patients will not benefit from this protocol could allow for targeted adjuvant therapy to ensure optimal outcomes.
Considering a “micro” to “macro” view of the tumor, comprehensive clinical evaluation for cancer involves
acquiring multi-scale data, including radiology (e.g., CT, MRI) which provides macroscopic morphology and
structural tumor details, histology images containing rich phenotypic information at cellular level, molecular data
(e.g., genome sequencing, gene expression, epigenomics, also known as multi-omics) which captures the
underlying biological processes, and the clinical data (e.g., age, sex). Ability to comprehensively combine
disparate sources of information through computational approaches could enable discovery of new prognostic
and predictive markers to reliably assess risks associated with response of chemotherapy and clinical outcomes.
The F99 phase of this proposal continues my dissertation research on developing deep leaning (DL) multimodal
models (mmSurvNet) to build prognostic markers for clinical outcomes, by combining MRI and digital pathology,
in rectal and GB tumors. My research for the F99 phase is driven by the hypothesis that DL models, using co-
registered pathology and radiology images that capture spatially co-localized tumor biology, can yield robust and
reliable prognostic integrated-markers to predict clinical outcomes. Towards this, I will construct multimodal
survival (mmSurvNet) models employing DL architectures that maximize spatial information across pathology
and radiology. The attention maps for mmSurvNet will allow for establishing biological relevance, by spatially
correlating radiology images with corresponding pathology which will contain annotations of known prognostic
tissue characteristics. My proposed K00 phase will involve building predictive DL models (mmPredictNet)
through incorporation of genomic, clinical, longitudinal data together with radiology and pathology images to build
integrated markers predictive of response to chemotherapy, while also accounting for population health
disparities. The current and future goals of my research are to develop comprehensive and reliable computational
tools for clinically impactful treatment decision support in oncology."

Choroidal capillaries are normally kept behind the retina by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer
of cells located between the retinal parenchyma and choroidal plexus. In humans, RPE integrity may
deteriorate with aging, especially in a small central area of the retina known as the macula. As a result, the
normally avascular photoreceptor tissue may become invaded by leaky choroidal capillaries through choroidal
neovascularization (CNV), which is a hallmark of the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
a leading cause of blindness among the senior population. Despite the short-term benefits of anti-VEGF
therapy, there is still no effective long-term treatment. To promote the development of novel therapies with
long-term benefits, we propose to create a chronic CNV model in which CNV occurs due to a set of
pathophysiological conditions mimicking those associated with wet AMD, including genetic susceptibility,
stressful environment, and aging. We will refer to the novel mouse model as age-related CNV (ArCNV),
following the style of “age-related macular degeneration”, although aging is not the only trigger in both cases.
In preliminary studies, genetic susceptibility was introduced into mice by the knockin of a Cre-dependent
transgene that is designed to knock down 5 specific mRNA targets (through the expression of 5 siRNAs) and
overexpress two proteins. The candidate genes were selected because their human homologs are associated
with increased risk of wet AMD. To simulate environmental risks, we designed a novel treatment regime
consisting of oxidative diet, smoking product, and light (oxDSL). When carried out separately, Cre-activation of
the transgene or treatment of wild-type C57BL/6J mice with oxDSL alone led to pre-CNV phenotypes such as
RPE degeneration, but not outright CNV. In combination, however, global transgene activation and treatment
with oxDSL led to CNV by 7 months of age, but not at much younger ages. Thus, the ArCNV model is age-
dependent. On other hand, the occurrence of CNV at the relatively early phase of aging will accelerate
research progress. In proposed studies, we will systematically characterize CNV onset and progression, along
with related phenotypes and molecular changes (Aim 1). Given the central role of the RPE barrier, we will also
activate the transgene with RPE-specific Cre and investigate whether such mice will develop CNV when
treated with the oxDSL regime (Aim 2). At the completion of this project, we will have systematically
characterized this novel mouse model, thus providing a highly valuable tool to the CNV research community."

Cancer is driven by interactions between diverse cell types and their tissue microenvironment. Emerging single-
cell and spatial transcriptomic systems are mapping cancer tissues, in the process capturing the diversity of cell
types and states and exposing the importance of spatial cell interactions in determining therapeutic response in
individual patients. Multi-omics software developed in ITCR—including CoGAPS, projectR, SpaceMarkers, and
Domino developed by our group—can analyze single-cell and spatial multi-omics data to infer cell types and
phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment, identify which cells interact, and discover how cell-cell interactions
drive molecular changes. However, these analyses yield static snapshots that cannot capture the dynamics of
cancer ecosystems. Mathematical modeling can “fill in the gaps” between these snapshots, allowing teams to
form hypotheses on how and why cells interact, “encode” their hypotheses as simulation rules, and perform
“virtual experiments.” However, simulation rules and their parameters are difficult to match to genomic data. This
proposal bridges the gap between bioinformatics and mathematical biology by merging our bioinformatics soft-
ware for single-cell and spatial multi-omics data with PhysiCell, an agent-based modeling framework developed
by our group to simulate the movement and interaction of many individual cell agents in virtual tissue environ-
ments. The “glue” between these packages is a novel cell behavior grammar that “encodes” cell rules learned
from high-throughput data as intuitive, interpretable hypothesis statements that can be automatically transformed
into simulation code. In this proposal, we refine the cell behavior grammar while analyzing previously published
cancer data to create digital “templates” for key cell types in cancer ecosystems, refine PhysiCell to import the
templates, and create PhysiCell Cloud: a free, “zero-install” cloud resource to build, execute, and visualize can-
cer models without writing computer code. We refine CoGAPS, SpaceMarkers, projectR, and Domino to learn
cell behavior rules from spatial transcriptomics data and format them with the grammar, and extend PhysiCell to
read cell types, positions, and rules stored in standard single-cell, spatial, and multi-omics classes. We develop
sophisticated pipelines for PhysiCell models that can quantify model uncertainty, automatically fit models to tran-
scriptomics data, and validate models on real world tumor datasets. We extend PhysiCell Cloud to a full-fledged
science gateway that includes secure and searchable user storage, data structures and code (APIs) to connect
PhysiCell Cloud to Python, R, and Bioconductor pipelines in ITCR, and a cost-free high-performance computing
backend to seamlessly run large-scale model exploration and uncertainty quantification pipelines. Educational
expertise and community feedback—including from an advisory board, annual training workshops, and daily
classroom use—will drive usability refinements. Altogether, this approach will bridge bioinformatics and mathe-
matical modeling to provide a comprehensive platform for patient-specific mechanistic tumor modeling, to enable
future computationally-drien experimental design, virtual clinical trials, and digital twins research.

Research: At the time of cancer diagnosis, 40% - 60% of patients are overweight or obese. Despite this, there
is a dearth of literature on the impact of weight status on cancer-induced cachexia - the unintentional loss of lean
mass, which directly contributes to functional dependency, poor treatment outcomes, and decreased survival.
An “obesity paradox” has been postulated; however, the epidemiology remains equivocal on the
benefits/detriments of obesity on cachexia status. While obesity and cachexia are diseases at opposite ends of
the weight spectrum, these pathologies share some underlying perturbations (e.g. mitochondrial dysfunction and
microbial dysbiosis) that may exacerbate functional decrements when these morbidities co-occur. Evidence
supports a role for mitochondrial dysfunction in the progression of cachexia. Indeed, we and others have shown
that impaired mitochondrial function and dysregulated mitochondrial quality control (biogenesis, dynamics, and
mitophagy) are associated with cachexia. Further, evidence links specific metabolites, microbes, and their
metabolic pathways with cachexia status. Incidentally, obesity is also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction
and alterations in gut bacterial populations. However, the impact of obesity on cachexia and associated
perturbations (mitochondrial dysfunction and gut dysbiosis) has not been established. Therefore, the goal of my
F99/K00 is to 1) understand the microbial and metabolic perturbations associated with cancer cachexia in the
obese state (F99), and 2) using multi-omics, examine the relationship between microbes and mitochondria in
cancer cachexia and identify strategies for intervention. My central hypothesis is that cancer-induced
cachexia is exacerbated in an obese state and gut microbial-muscle mitochondria interactions are
central in the coordination of this worsened phenotype. I will test this hypothesis in two specific aims as
follows: 1) Examine the impact of obesity on microbial alterations, metabolic perturbations, and skeletal muscle
dysfunction with cancer-induced cachexia in the obese state and 2) Establish microbiome-mitochondria
interactions in cancer cachexia in the context of obesity and identify strategies for intervention. These studies
will uncover the impact of obesity on cancer cachexia and will identify microbiome-mitochondrial interactions,
provoking novel opportunities for intervention. Career Goals: My long-term research goal is to become an
independent researcher at a top-tier research institution focused on prevention/treatment of cancer and cancer
therapy related off-target effects including cachexia. Career Development Plan: The proposed career
development plan is designed to enhance my knowledge, technical expertise, and professional skills.
Specifically, I will receive training in 1) obesity phenotyping and cachexia modeling, 2) mitochondrial behavior,
3) microbiome and microbial metabolites, and 4) professional development. The proposed F99/K00 award is an
important step in realizing my career goal. This proposed research and training in this F99/K00 will provide me
with the acumen to launch a successful independent career in the field of cancer cachexia."

Air pollution is a known environmental risk factor for lung cancer, but the detailed mechanisms driving air
pollution-induced carcinogenesis and the key molecular events involved remained underexplored.
Understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways is vital for the development of targeted
preventive and therapeutic strategies for lung cancer induced by air pollution. Our previous metabolomics study
findings have suggested the important roles of amino acids and peptides (the building blocks of proteins) in
modifying the association between air pollution exposure and lung cancer risk. Comprehensive proteomics
analysis will provide critical insights into how these biomolecules are perturbed in air pollution-induced lung
cancer. Although high-throughput single omics approaches have shown significant potential in revealing
biological responses to air pollution exposures and lung cancer development, they often overlook
interconnections among omics layers. Multi-omics integration can offer a more holistic view of underlying
mechanisms. Moreover, omics-based risk prediction models have emerged as promising tools to identify
individuals at high risk of lung cancer, but their development and application are still lacking.
During the F99 phase, I will focus on investigating key molecular signatures and pathways underlying air
pollution toxicity in lung carcinogenesis. In Aim 1.1, I will determine the potential mediation role of proteins in the
causal pathway from air pollution exposure to lung cancer. Using an advanced proteomics analysis with Meet-
In-The-Middle and high-dimensional mediation approaches, I will comprehensively evaluate the protein profiles
to understand their involvement in mediating the etiology of air pollution-induced lung cancer. In Aim 1.2, I will
conduct innovative multi-omics integration across proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics to identify a highly
correlated molecular network linking air pollution toxicity with elevated lung cancer risk. Using a posteriori
integration and a priori integration, I expect to identify a consistent molecular network, consisting of novel and
closely related omics signals including single nucleotide polymorphisms, proteins, and metabolites, that unveils
air pollution's role in lung cancer development.
Although low-dose computed tomography is the standard screening for lung cancer, it's primarily recommended
for heavy former and current smokers. Notably, approximately 45% of lung cancer cases occur in light smokers
and never-smokers falling outside the recommendation guidelines. Transitioning to my K00 phase at a world-
class cancer research institute, I will focus on developing omics-based risk prediction models to enhance lung
cancer risk stratification by smoking status. In Aim 2.1, I will develop genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics
risk scores in ever- and never-smokers separately and evaluate the associations of individual and combined risk
scores with lung cancer risk. In Aim 2.2, I will evaluate the predictive performance of individual and combined
omics-based risk scores for lung cancer risk by smoking status."

In August 2023, the historical town of Lāhainā on the island of Maui in the US state of Hawai‘i experienced the
deadliest wildfire in United States history, which destroyed the town and killed at least 100 people, with 4 still
missing. During and after the wildfire, there were reports of poor disaster preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts including dysfunctional communications, challenges in coordinating emergency services,
difficulties in providing needed resources to residents and responders, governmental failures, and cultural
insensitivities. This unprecedented disaster has brought new challenges to a community and system already
struggling with healthcare provider shortages, poor access to care, and a large population reliant on Medicaid
and other social services. The disaster has also introduced new environmental and health threats such as air
and water contaminants from chemicals and ash, respiratory diseases, and mental health concerns. Further,
the rich ethnocultural diversity of Maui’s populations, including Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Filipino,
and Latino communities, with their collective and unique risk and protective health and social factors make the
study especially significant. As the global climate crisis increases, it is important to collect and analyze current
evidence to inform policies and practices to mitigate short- and long-term consequences of upcoming
disasters. This study responds to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-22-233 which establishes an
accelerated review/award process to support research to understand health outcomes related to an
unexpected and/or time-sensitive event including environmental disasters and other emergent climate threats.
This funding mechanism employs a two-phased approach. An R61 phase (year 1) will provide the formative
work to inform the aims of an R33 phase (years 2-5) which will test the various mechanisms that potentially
explain health risks, system and government responses, and their impacts. Both phases will engage a
community advisory board representing various Maui-based stakeholders including community and
government leaders, state health department and emergency service representatives, schools, traditional
healers, and health providers, and will incorporate the National Institute of Minority Health & Health Disparities
research framework adapted to reflect social and cultural influences of health outcomes in Hawai‘i and the
Maui wildfire. The R61 phase aims to qualitatively understand the physical and mental health impacts of the
wildfire and the personal, family, community, cultural, and institutional factors that influence these impacts,
such as governmental responses, and barriers and facilitators to accessing emergency health and social
services by residents, first responders, and community and service organizations. The R33 phase aims to
quantitatively study the wildfire experiences, patient- and system-level barriers to care during and after the
disaster, the mechanisms leading to physical and mental health risks, and health care utilization patterns."

More than 40% of patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) are refractory to direct intraocular injection of anti-
VEGF antibodies, the standard of care. The inability to effectively treat DR puts a heavy burden on the health
care system and limits the quality of life for those affected. The need for novel, clinically relevant targets that can
be exploited for new therapies is very clear. Diabetes is well-known to induce retinal mitochondrial dysfunction
that leads to DNA damage and cytosolic release. Cytosolic DNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway, inducing
inflammation. Although the cGAS-STING signaling axis is essential for sensing foreign DNA and thus
contributing to innate immunity, aberrant activation of this pathway by self-DNA is a significant contributor to
autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Activation of cGAS-STING due to chronic diabetes-induced
inflammation leads to activation of circulating monocytes, eventually giving rise to leukostasis. Leukostasis
causes cell death and breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, leading to retinal vascular leakage, a major cause
of diabetic macular edema and leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients. We have shown that 1) the
cGAS-STING pathway is activated in ischemic retinopathy; 2) inhibition of STING attenuates monocyte activation
and alleviates retinal leukostasis and angiogenesis; 3) STING knockout significantly reduces retinal leakage,
number of leukocytes in the retina, and DR relevant inflammatory factors in an oxygen-induced retinopathy
murine model; and 4) small molecule agonism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARa)
inhibits the cGAS-STING signaling axis and cytosolic mitochondrial DNA release. The objective of this
exploratory R21 proposal is to assess two mechanistically differentiated approaches to inhibit STING with
bifunctional small molecules in the context of DR. In Aim 1 we will assess small molecule induced STING
degradation through proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as a strategy for STING inhibition in the context
of DR. The PROTAC strategy is unexplored in the eye but especially well-suited for ocular conditions. In Aim 2
we will leverage our success in developing selective PPARa agonists as new therapeutic leads for DR to develop
first-in-class bifunctional probes that simultaneously agonize PPARa (neuronal protection) and inhibit STING
(retinal vascular homeostasis and inflammation) to explore the potential benefits of polypharmacology in retinal
disease. The heterobifunctional modulators of these two targets are expected to provide a spatiotemporal benefit
affecting multiple cell types and pathological events. This work is conceptually and technically innovative and is
expected to provide the fundamental data needed to enable proof-of-concept for the PROTAC and multi-action
compound strategies in ocular contexts (new approaches), a foundation for targeting STING in DR and related
retinal diseases (new target), and new compounds poised for biological and translational initiatives, respectively.
This project leverages a long-standing and productive collaboration leveraging expertise in medicinal chemistry
and biochemistry to advance knowledge regarding STING biology and therapeutic utility in DR."

10997202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Bacteria possess an extensive set of anti-viral immune systems to block the
intracellular replication of lytic bacterial viruses (bacteriophages or phages). Among these anti-
phage defenses, toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems are common, two-component genetic modules
containing a lethal toxin and its cognate neutralizing anti-toxin. TA systems serve as primed
defenses: expressed before infection, the antitoxin counteracts its toxin until it senses infection
and frees its toxin to block intracellular phage replication and kill the host bacterium.
 Recently, we identified DarTG1 as an anti-phage TA system (LeRoux 2022). DarTG1 consists
of (1) an ADP-ribosylase toxin, DarT1, that modifies single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to block phage
DNA replication & transcription and (2) a glycohydrolase antitoxin, DarG1, that removes ADP-
ribosylation during normal bacterial growth. Despite knowing how DarTG1 defends against phage,
it is unknown how DarTG1 senses phage infection while avoiding lethal spontaneous activation.
Goal/Preliminary Data: As DarT1 is always active when expressed without DarG1, I hypothesize
that DarG1 senses phage infection. Thus, I aim to elucidate how DarG1 senses viral infection and
stops counteracting DarT1. At present, only two TA systems have known activation mechanisms
during phage infection—host transcriptional shutdown and viral capsid expression—and DarG1
senses neither. Instead, my preliminary data suggest that DarG1 senses phage DNA metabolism.
First, we identified diverse phage DNA metabolism proteins that activate DarT1 in the absence of
infection, indicating that DarG1 senses a DNA-related process. Second, DarG1 physically
associates with E. coli’s single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) before infection, suggesting
that DarG1 localizes with SSB to ssDNA found at DNA replication forks and DNA lesions. Thus,
I hypothesize that DarG1 monitors ssDNA metabolism for infection-induced perturbations.
Approach: I will determine which phage DNA metabolism processes co-localize with DarG1
during infection and which are necessary for DarG1 to sense infection (aim 1). In parallel, I will
identify which DNA metabolism processes are sufficient for DarG1 to react in uninfected E. coli
by introducing targeted DNA perturbations & known E. coli DNA metabolism proteins (aim 2).
Significance: Uncovering how DarTG1 senses and initiates a response to phage infection will
enhance our understanding of anti-viral immunity, as DarG1-like NADAR-containing proteins are
found across prokaryotes & eukaryotes, suggesting any DarG1 surveillance mechanism identified
may be echoed in other prokaryotic & eukaryotic anti-viral systems."

In the developing nervous system, highly polarized and elongated cells exhibit spatial segregation of cellular
functions. This is exemplified by radial glia cells (RGCs), which are the neural stem cells that generate neurons
and glia in the developing cerebral cortex. RGCs have a basal process extending hundreds of micrometers in
mice, or centimeters in humans, to form basal endfeet at the pia. These basal endfeet reside in a distinct niche
composed of meninges, excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Notably endfeet are proposed to act as antennas
relaying signals. Endfoot integrity is essential for neuronal organization and is linked to several
neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, despite their importance, remarkably little is known about this subcellular
compartment of radial glia and its role in signaling at the niche. This proposal aims to elucidate fundamental
mechanisms by which RGCs signal and organize the pial niche during brain development. We focus on our
recent discovery that mRNAs are actively transported within RGCs, and localized to endfeet where they can be
locally translated. In the first funding cycle of this grant, we discovered endfeet contain a rich local transcriptome
and subcellular proteome. Functional interrogation of four localized transcripts showed converging requirements
for RGC morphology and interneuron organization. We also developed new tools to propel our understanding of
how RNA localization and local translation influences RGCs. Together, this establishes a novel tractable in vivo
paradigm for investigating local gene regulation in vivo during cortical neurogenesis. In this proposal we will
implement our new molecular tools and apply our unique expertise to address 3 interrelated questions: 1) What
is the molecular composition of RGC endfeet across development and how does this diverge in mouse and
human brains? 2) How does local translation in RGCs impact signaling at the niche? 3) How is local information
relayed within RGC basal structures? Successfully completed, we will have significantly advanced our
understanding of fundamental molecular mechanisms of cortical neurogenesis, and specifically how subcellular
compartments of neural stem cells mediate local gene expression and signaling. More broadly, we will gain
insights into mRNA localization and translation in the developing nervous system."

Current diagnostic tests for syphilis are non-optimal, in that they cannot differentiate active from past
infection, cannot diagnose congenital syphilis, and have low sensitivity in early and late disease. With
the number of infectious and congenital syphilis cases rapidly expanding in the US and worldwide,
curbing the spread of disease will be aided by development of a better diagnostic test that is definitive,
easily interpreted, and compatible with a point-of-care test format. In this research application we
propose to develop a direct syphilis diagnostic test that: (1) exhibits high sensitivity and specificity at all
disease stages; (2) can differentiate active versus past infections; (3) can differentiate syphilis from
yaws; (4) can allow accurate disease staging; and (5) can be adapted to a point-of-care format for ease
of testing in remote areas."

The urgency of the opioid crisis (over 80,000 deaths in the past year) has encouraged research
on understudied agents, such as the 5HT2A agonist psilocybin (PSI), for potential clinical benefit.
Recently, PSI has been designated as a ""breakthrough therapy"" for depression and has
demonstrated its potential benefits in substance-use disorders, including alcohol and nicotine
addiction. Observational data suggest a link between PSI use and reduced odds of developing
opioid use disorder (OUD). Emerging preclinical data suggest PSI may have neuroplasticity and
greater neurocognitive flexibility as potential mechanisms of action in clinical disorders, but clinical
trials have generally proceeded without mechanistic information in either the neurocognitive
flexibility (FLEX), or the “classic” motivational (“GO”!) and regulatory (STOP!) domains. The
proposed R61/R33 will address this need, examining PSI's impact on these 3 brain-behavioral
domains in OUD patients. 72 individuals (R61 = 24; R33 = 48) will be prospectively assigned to
receive either 25mg) or 1mg (control) of PSI, with selected pre- and post-PSI assessments that
probe brain, cognition, and behavior. Aim 1 (""GO!"" motivational domain), will examine brain and
behavioral responses to cues and to drug-related videos. The hypothesis is PSI will reduce the
brain (motivational circuitry) and behavioral (reduced positive affective bias) response to drug
cues. Aim 2 (""STOP!"" inhibitory domain) will assess brain responses during a valenced Go-NoGo
task and during attempted inhibition of craving to drug videos and during behavioral performance
of a standard (motor pre-protency) Go-NoGo task. The hypothesis is PSI will increase recruitment
of STOP circuitry in the brain tasks and will reduce errors of commission in the behavioral probe.
Aim 3 will investigate the ""FLEX"" (neurocognitive flexibility) domain using the Wisconsin Card Sort
Task (brain) and Penn Conditional Exclusion Task (behavior). The hypothesis is PSI will enhance
recruitment in FLEX substrates and reduce perseverative errors. Exploratory measures will
include craving, withdrawal, psychedelic effects, depression, and prior adversity. Brain-behavioral
probes showing large effect sizes will proceed to the R33 phase, and examinations will expand
to include network-level changes in the brain. This proposal is of high importance for
understanding PSI's effects on brain, cognition, and behavior in those with OUD – critical for the
rational advance of PSI for OUD – and for the many other disorders with unmet need."

Our long-term aim is to understand glial roles in nervous system health, aging and disease in molecular detail.
The human nervous system has about equal numbers of glia cells and neurons, and interactions between
these two cell types is critical for neural functions. An important site of contact between glia and neurons is the
neuron-ending, where neurons receive input from other neurons (interneuron dendritic spine) or the
environment (sensory receptive-endings). Neuron-ending shape dictates appropriate neuron connectivity and
functions, including sensory perception and learning and memory. While it is appreciated that glia modulate
neuron-ending shapes and functions, molecular mechanisms underlying this remain poorly defined. Indeed,
many fundamental principles of glia-neuron interactions remain unclear, such as whether all glia-neuron pairs
interact using identical molecular mechanisms. It is however important to address this gap in our
understanding of glial functions, because impaired glia-neuron interactions are implicated in many neurological
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Autism, epilepsy and may contribute to neural decline with age.
We propose to dissect glia-neuron interactions in molecular detail in vivo, using C. elegans as a powerful and
genetically amenable experimental platform. C. elegans glia resemble vertebrate glia, and our recent studies
have validated this as a powerful setting to rapidly probe glia-neuron molecular interactions. We previously
identified two novel molecular mechanisms by which glia interact with neurons to regulate their shape,
functions and associated animal behaviors. All molecular components of these mechanisms that we have
uncovered so far are broadly expressed, suggesting that aspects of glia-neuron interactions are evolutionarily
conserved across species. Importantly, C. elegans glia are accessible for rapid and reproducible genetic and
cellular manipulations in vivo. Effects of such manipulation can be investigated at multiple levels of inquiry,
from molecular (genetic, genomic, protein biochemistry), cell-biology (cell shape, cell-cell contacts) and circuits
(functional imaging, mapped connectome) to animal behavior and aging studies, and disease models
(Alzheimer's, Parkinson's). Here, we propose to dissect molecular mechanisms of glia-neuron interactions
throughout animal age in detail. For this, we will couple the experimental platform we established, and
techniques described above, with the multiple genetic mutants we recently identified to (1) determine how
multiple molecular pathways together enable interactions between a single glia-neuron pair; (2) investigate in
mechanistic detail how a single glia can differentiate associated neurons to regulate them differently, and (3)
dissect mechanisms by which different glia-neuron pairs interact to regulate neuron functions with age.
Together, these studies will build a comprehensive molecular framework of how a glia cell modulates the
functions of associated neurons throughout animal an animal's lifespan."

Mutations in nuclear envelope proteins (NEPs) cause devastating genetic diseases, known as
envelopathies, which primarily affect the heart and skeletal muscle. The LEM domain nuclear envelope
protein 2 (LEMD2) is a ubiquitously expressed inner nuclear membrane protein. In vitro studies reported
that LEMD2 interacts with DNA-binding proteins, implicating LEMD2 in genome regulation and
chromatin organization processes. Importantly, a missense mutation in the LEMD2 coding sequence
causes severe cardiomyopathy in humans. In a recent study, we reported that “humanized” mice
carrying the Lemd2 c.T38>G human mutation as well as cardiac-specific Lemd2 KO (cKO) mice
develop dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and die prematurely due to heart failure. Moreover, Lemd2-
deficient cardiomyocytes (CMs) display high levels of DNA damage. Despite its association with cardiac
phenotypes in both human and mice, the role of LEMD2 in the mammalian heart and the pathological
mechanisms responsible for its association with cardiac disease are far from being understood.
Based on my preliminary findings, I hypothesize that high levels of DNA damage in LEMD2-mutant
CMs cause the development of cardiomyopathy. To test this hypothesis, I will first perform a
comprehensive characterization of the DNA damage and DNA damage response (DDR) in both mice
and human CMs carrying LEMD2 mutations. The second aim is focused on the mechanistic link
between LEMD2 loss-of-function, DNA damage and cardiomyopathy. I will determine if LEMD2
interacts with the chromatin-binding protein BAF, and whether the LEMD2 c.T38>G mutation disrupts
this interaction. I will also detect nuclear envelope ruptures, cytosolic DNA leakage, and the activation
of the pro-inflammatory pathway cGAS in LEMD2-mutant CMs. The third aim will determine the
therapeutic potential of LEMD2 gene therapy for envelopathies characterized by the presence of DNA
damage. I will overexpress LEMD2 in CMs and mice carrying mutations in the lamin A gene and assess
the extent of rescue at the structural and functional levels.
By accomplishing the objectives of this proposal, we will reveal important mechanistic insights
regarding LEMD2 functions and its associated cardiomyopathy. With this new knowledge, we hope to
ultimately design new therapeutic strategies and preventive methods for genetic cardiomyopathies."
10983847,"Title: Improving dog vaccinations: a development and feasibility study to pave the
way for effective, synchronized dog vaccination campaigns in Africa
Dog-mediated human rabies has the highest case fatality rate of any known disease and kills
approximately 59,000 people annually particularly in Asia and Africa, where people are
infected following bites from rabid dogs. Vaccination of at least 70% of the dog population is
100% effective in preventing the spread of rabies to humans. However, achieving 70%
coverage can be difficult across large geographic areas. Traditional dog vaccination in East
Africa involves teams of vaccinators moving village-to village across a district. Under this
team-lead approach, campaigns last 30 to 60 days depending on available personnel and
geography. Although this approach sometimes works, its execution at scale is challenging,
expensive, and time-consuming.
The objective of the proposed research is to carry out an implementation trial to investigate
the potential of synchronized dog vaccinations which have been highly successful in Latin
America. Such synchronized campaigns could benefit massively from a coordinated mass
media campaign in the lead-up before the vaccination day. We will investigate whether
combined media and synchronized campaigns can improve vaccination coverage.
Our first hypothesis is that synchronized campaigns will increase dog owners’ participation in
MDV. Our second hypothesis is that synchronized campaigns will lead to the large number
of dogs being vaccinated, resulting in reduction in the overall delivery cost. Our final
hypothesis is that synchronized MDV delivery will result in improved public health outcomes
and achieve elimination more rapidly than standard team-led MDV.
Dog vaccination will be carried out into six districts in a 3-arms of the implementation trial (2
districts per Arm). We will compare (i) vaccination coverage, (ii) cost per dog vaccinated and
(iii) health impacts in Arm A: team-led delivery (which is logistically challenging and results in
irregular coverage, at cost), versus Arm B: synchronized campaigns without media
intervention and Arm C: synchronized campaigns and media intervention.
With a date of 2030 set by WHO/OIE/FAO for the global elimination of dog-mediated human
rabies, these results are needed to guide elimination in dog-rabies endemic countries"

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a lethal cancer with a 10%-25% 5-year survival rate. Given
the importance of early detection, the initiation process of ESCC must be better defined. To study this process,
we focused on preneoplastic cells, which have the potential to progress to neoplastic cells. We
comprehensively analyzed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from human ESCC and healthy
donors, as well as normal adjacent to cancer datasets, to reveal the spatial characteristics of preneoplastic
cells. We also analyzed scRNA-seq data from a mouse model of carcinogen-induced ESCC to identify features
of preneoplastic cells in a temporal context. Strikingly, molecular analysis revealed that preneoplastic cells,
though histologically normal, exhibited elevated copy number variations and reduced TP53 and CDKN2A
signaling compared to healthy normal samples in both spatial and temporal datasets. The CELF2 gene
emerged as a robust marker of preneoplastic cells across both datasets, validated by an increased presence of
CELF2+ cells in Trp53 and Cdkn2a double knockout (PC) organoids. These CELF2+ cells showed increased
plasticity, acquiring cancer stem cell features and undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). Aim 1
is to determine the cellular reprogramming in CELF2+ cells when TP53 and CDKN2A are ablated. The
reprogrammed stemness will be validated by comparing the tumorigenicity of CELF2+ and CELF2- cells of PC
organoids. Additionally, tumorigenicity of a genetically engineered mouse model with Trp53 and Cdkn2a
deletion will be tested in the presence or absence of CELF2+ cells. Cellular reprogramming will also be
evaluated by comparing the exact cell lineage of wild-type and PC organoids and PC-derived tumors.
Employing cutting-edge genetic barcoding, we will trace the entire cellular trajectory. Cell lineage established in
Aim 1 will be the most reliable reference for preneoplastic cells and normal esophageal cells. Furthermore, cell
lineage and population analyses of PC-derived tumors will elucidate the mechanism of clonal selection during
tumorigenesis. Aim 2 will address the role of EMP-undergone CELF2+ cells in immune evasion. Although EMP
is conventionally known for its function in invasion and metastasis, its role in immune evasion is less studied.
Our preliminary experiment identified mesenchymal-CELF2+ cells in the tumor niche release chemokines and
cytokines. Aim 2 will disclose the efficiency of tumorigenicity when mesenchymal-CELF2+ cells are co-cultured
with immune-rejected cells. In addition, the candidate chemokine and cytokine genes will be manipulated in
preneoplastic cells to test our working model. Collectively, the proposed study will elucidate the cellular and
genetic mechanisms of ESCC initiation. Under the guidance of Dr. Jae-Il Park, a mentor, Dr. Ko's research
skillset, such as mouse genetics, organoids, and cancer signaling, as well as the skills of writing, teaching, and
mentoring, will be expanded during the K99 phase. Completing the research and training will significantly
facilitate Dr. Ko’s transition to an independent investigator."

 Suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth aged 10-12. Recent data from the CDC show that
girls have greater rates of STBs than boys—1 in 3 adolescent girls consider attempting suicide. However, we
know relatively little about what factors contribute to risk for suicide in preteen girls aside from exposure to
childhood adversities such as experiencing threat (e.g., interpersonal violence). Our team’s research program
investigates biological responses to interpersonal stressors as a mechanism linking childhood threat exposure
and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) in adolescent girls. However, to improve early identification and
intervention efforts, there is a critical need to identify STB risk factors that precede this biological sensitivity to
interpersonal stressors that occurs later in pubertal development. Social motivation (SM) toward peers and
peripubertal hormones typically increase during preteen years prior to adolescent biological sensitization to
interpersonal stressors. The purpose of the current study is to investigate SM as a novel risk factor linking
childhood threat exposure with STB risk in preteen girls. Aim 1 will refine existing assessments of SM and
STBs for use in a diverse set of preteen girls. Aim 2 will test our theory that maladaptive SM (e.g., high desire
to avoid social failure and low effort to engage with others) contributes to preteen emergence of STBs,
particularly among girls with advanced pubertal timing. Aim 3 will evaluate whether childhood threat exposure
predicts both STBs and maladaptive SM in the preteen years. Aim 3 will also test our preteen STB risk
pathway, which posits that childhood threat exposure increases risk for STBs via maladaptive SM. Finally,
exploratory Aim 4 will examine whether this novel risk pathway is exacerbated in girls with advanced pubertal
timing. We will enroll 200 preteens (ages 8-11) assigned female at birth, premenarchal at baseline, and
enriched for childhood threat exposure. Assessments will occur at baseline, 6- and 12-months. All visits will
have questionnaires/interviews assessing STBs, psychopathology, childhood threat exposure, and SM, along
with SM behavioral assessments. Visits will include 4-week ecological momentary assessments (2x daily) and
saliva acquisition (x6) for hormone assay. Two Advisory Boards will collaborate with us on measure
refinement, data collection, and result dissemination: (1) adult community leaders and caregivers and (2)
preteen/teen girls with lived experience relevant to this investigation. Understanding the proposed associations
and mechanisms is a critical first step to identifying specific and focused targets for preventive interventions.
Thus, the current research proposal will have a high impact on the field by contributing important knowledge to
suicide prevention efforts in preteen girls."
10986185,"Adolescence is a window of vulnerability for the development of schizophrenia and other mental disorders. In
schizophrenia, imaging studies have found that thalamo-prefrontal resting state connectivity is reduced during
adolescence prior to disease onset. This decrease in functional connectivity has been linked to cognitive
symptoms and the etiology of the disorder. For many years, an altered maturation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
has been implicated in the cognitive deficits of mental disorders yet the mechanisms that drive PFC maturation
are largely unknown. Because thalamic input activity is important for circuit maturation in sensory cortices, we
hypothesize here that thalamic input activity is also important for prefrontal circuit maturation.
To address whether adolescence is a sensitive time-period during which thalamic activity regulates the
maturation of PFC circuitry, we used mice and compared the effects of reducing activity in the thalamic nuclei
projecting to the PFC during postnatal days P20-50 with that in adulthood (P90-120). We found that inhibiting
the thalamus during adolescence leads to a long-lasting decrease in the density of thalamo-mPFC projections
and a reduced excitatory drive to mPFC neurons. Adolescent thalamic inhibition further causes cognitive deficits
in attentional set shifting during adulthood that are associated with disrupted correlated neuronal activity and
task outcome encoding in the mPFC. In contrast, thalamic inhibition during adulthood has no long-lasting
consequences on mPFC excitation, correlated activity, outcome encoding and behavior. Strikingly, exciting the
thalamus in adulthood during the set shifting task rescues in vivo neuronal activity and cognitive deficits induced
by adolescent inhibition.
While these data point to adolescence as a sensitive time window for PFC circuit maturation the underlying
mechanisms by which adolescent inhibition impairs mPFC maturation are still unclear. To address this, first, the
development of mPFC circuitry needs to be characterized during adolescence. Second, it will be important to
determine whether adolescent inhibition induces long-lasting changes in intrinsic mPFC circuitry, and which
specific mPFC projections and interneurons are regulated by adolescent thalamic inhibition. Third, it will be
important to know when such changes arise and how they relate to the changes in in vivo cross correlated activity
and outcome encoding. Our data further suggest that boosting thalamic activity could provide a strategy for
rescuing cognitive deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders. However, as presented, the beneficial effect only
occurs while the thalamus is stimulated. Therefore, strategies will need to be identified that allow for a longer
lasting rescue of the cognitive abilities. We will address these questions using three aims: Aim 1: To determine
when and where adolescent thalamic activity regulates the development of mPFC circuit connectivity. Aim 2: To
determine whether the impact of adolescent thalamic inhibition on cognition requires maturation of the mPFC.
Aim 3. To determine whether thalamic excitation can lead to a long-lasting rescue of the cognitive deficit."

Eysz, Inc. is developing a mobile health (mHealth) application and algorithms for diagnosing and monitoring
absence epilepsy remotely. Accurate diagnosis and monitoring of seizures and therapeutic effects are critical
elements of effective epilepsy treatment. Unfortunately, absence seizures are notoriously difficult to identify,
leading to diagnostic delay and difficulty monitoring treatments. The gold standard for diagnosing absence
seizures is video EEG (VEEG), but this method is expensive, limited to clinical settings, and can be hard to
access. The gold standard for monitoring absence epilepsy is patient self-reported data, which studies have
shown to be more than 50% inaccurate. Other strategies for remote monitoring, such as ambulatory EEG, lack
the sensitivity and specificity of VEEG, and can add to the stigma people with epilepsy experience. There have
been no new therapy approvals for absence epilepsy since the 1990s, in part due to the difficulty of measuring
outcomes. Thus, there is a critical need for a remote diagnostic/monitoring tool for absence seizures. Eysz
therefore plans to develop an mHealth app that uses (1) voluntary guided hyperventilation (HV), with (2) eye
movement and facial biometric data to monitor seizure susceptibility and treatment responses in people with
absence seizures. Voluntary HV triggers seizures in >90% of people with absence epilepsy and is a standard
clinical tool to assist in diagnosing and monitoring absence epilepsy. HV has also been shown to be safe and
effective when performed on a daily basis to activate seizures and thereby shorten VEEG monitoring sessions.
Thus, HV offers a promising tool for use in the context of at-home monitoring of seizure activity. Eysz is
developing software and algorithms for detecting seizures using eye movement data, starting with absence
seizures. Eysz proposes to extend the use of video-based eye-tracking (and facial biometric tracking) to a
smartphone-based application that includes software-guided HV. This Phase I proposal focuses on initial testing
of our smartphone-based tool for guided HV and video data collection. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1)
Collect eye-movement and facial biometric data from subjects undergoing HV concurrently with VEEG; 2)
Evaluate the potential for a new “gold standard” metric for algorithm validation to enable mHealth development
in the home environment; and 3) Develop machine learning (ML) algorithms that detect seizures from eye
tracking and facial biometrics data. Eysz aims to demonstrate >75% sensitivity for detection of seizures >7 s in
duration, providing a strong foundation for future evaluation of at-home use of the app and algorithm accuracy
in a larger cohort of patients."
10986229,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Parent Grant)
Post-hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) is a leading cause of morbidity in premature infants. PHH is triggered
by germinal matrix intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) that results in accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
in the brain, compression of surrounding brain tissue, and permanent neurological deficits. While PHH is
clearly caused by an altered balance of CSF production and removal, the mechanisms are poorly understood,
limiting our ability to guide rational therapies. Here, we propose to examine two processes that could be
manipulated therapeutically to alleviate PHH: (1) ion and fluid transport by the choroid plexus (ChP), and (2)
ventricular blood clearance by macrophages. In adults under normal physiological conditions, sheets of
specialized ChP epithelial cells secrete CSF via an incompletely understood set of membrane proteins
including NKCC1, a phosphorylation activated bi-directional Na-K-Cl cotransporter. Strikingly, we recently
discovered that NKCC1 participates in CSF removal rather than CSF secretion during early stages of brain
development. CSF-K+ levels are significantly higher in embryos than adults, likely explaining this opposite
direction of NKCC1 water transport. Experimental introduction of blood into the ventricles during development
appears to further elevate CSF-K levels, and to drive intracellular calcium activity in ChP epithelial cells,
expression of the immediate early gene c-fos, and increased expression/phosphorylation of NKCC1. Our
findings suggest a novel counter-regulatory response to IVH in premature infants: ChP absorption of CSF via
NKCC1, driven by K+. We will test this hypothesis by determining if NKCC1 activation either worsens or
mitigates hydrocephalus in our mouse IVH model (Aim 1; preliminary data suggests the latter). We also found
that following IVH, blood products linger in the developing ventricles and may account for the persistence of
PHH. The brain's ventricles and the apical surface of the ChP are home to specific macrophages known as
Kolmer cells. While Kolmer cells have been implicated as responders to brain hemorrhage, their scavenging
and other functions have remained elusive. Our data suggest that during early stages of brain development,
ventricular macrophages/Kolmer cells are activated and recruited to the site of blood leakage within the
ventricle (Aim 2A) and that these macrophages are necessary and sufficient to clear blood and/or inflammatory
signals from the ventricles (Aim 2B, C). Collectively, our data suggest that the ultimate severity of PHH
depends on a developmental stage-specific interplay between blood products, ion gradients (e.g. [K]), immune
and inflammatory reactions, and NKCC1 expression levels. An estimated 20% of infants that experience
intraventricular bleeds develop PHH. We suspect this is due to insufficient endogenous compensatory
responses. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes by laying the groundwork for
development of clinical treatments that boost endogenous removal of CSF and blood that drive the pathogenic
processes that lead to PHH. This proposal should also guide therapies for adult IVH and other conditions with
disrupted extracellular ionic homeostasis."
10984872,"Addiction is a pressing public health concern that impacts millions of people in the U.S, causing
a sizable burden on the health care system and thousands of unnecessary deaths, 1 in 5 of which
are due to psychostimulant abuse, such as cocaine. However, the mechanisms that control
response to cocaine are not clearly defined, and there is a pressing need to understand these
mechanisms. The current study will explore the possibility that the neuropeptide, NOF/Q (aka:
nociceptin), is a potent cocaine reward suppressor that acts in mesolimbic terminal regions of the
nucleus accumbens (NAc). Preliminary data strongly support that NOF/Q signaling in NAc blocks
cocaine reward, and that NOF/Q can act directly upon DAergic terminals within NAc. However,
the mechanisms and circuitry that mediate NOF/Q reward suppression in NAc are completely
undefined, nor is it known whether there is basal NOF/Q tone in NAc that constitutively sets
sensitivity to rewarding substances. The proposed exploratory studies will leverage a variety of
cutting-edge viral and genetic tools to fully characterize NOF/Q tone and effects on reward in
NAc, as well as the NOF/Q circuitry innervating NAc and that likely serve as an endogenous
reward suppression system. Studies in Aim 1 will provide an in-depth analysis of cocaine reward
suppression by NOF/Q in male and female mice, and leverage optogenetics in PNOCCre mice to
determine whether endogenous NOF/Q signaling is sufficient to suppress cocaine reward.
Studies in Aim 2 will leverage NOPRfl/fl mice to test whether NOF/Q signaling on DAergic
mesolimbic terminals is required for cocaine suppression by NOF/Q. In addition, Aim 2 studies
will use PNOCCre mice to retrogradely trace NOF/Q afferents in NAc, to the likely source of
endogenous NOF/Q. Taken together, these studies will provide a fundamental understanding of
the potential for NOF/Q signaling as powerful suppressant of cocaine reward, and will shed light
on an intrinsic mechanism that sets reward tone. Importantly, the findings will lay the necessary
groundwork for future work aimed at understanding the mechanisms and specific circuits that
mediate NOF/Q reward suppression."

This is an administrative supplement to support the career development and training of a deserving
underrepresented applicant, Damian Lozano, as he completes his dissertation research. The parent R01
involves studying mechanisms which contribute to outcomes after ischemic stroke, the leading cause of long-
term disability in the U.S. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have demonstrated therapeutic benefit in stroke recovery,
however mechanisms are still being elucidated. Our data show NSC function is influenced by low-density
lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1), a multifunctional modulator of cell signaling. We discovered that in
NSCs, LRP1 enables NSC migration to ischemic lesions by regulating expression of the chemokine receptor
CXCR4. Loss of LRP1 in NSCs also causes reduced lesion sizes. The parent R01 tests the overall hypothesis
that LRP1 promotes NSC migration toward ischemic lesions through CXCR4 regulation, yet also limits the
endogenous NSC-neuroprotective response.
A key question in the parent R01 involves understanding which LRP1 subdomains are responsible for discrete
phenotypes observed in our mouse model with adult NSC-specific knockout of LRP1. LRP1 is characterized by
an external ligand-binding domain, LRP1α, which is non-covalently associated with a transmembrane domain,
LRP1β. The LRP1β domain is essential for the trafficking and recycling of LRP1, assembly of signaling scaffolds,
and also can be cleaved to allow the c-terminus to transport to the nucleus and regulate transcription. The goal
of this supplement is to test which subdomains of LRP1β regulate CXCR4 expression and stroke recovery. Given
that we have observed reduced CXCR4 mRNA expression in vivo after LRP1 knockout, we hypothesize that
the c-terminal cleavage of LRP1 is responsible for transcriptional regulation that mediates CXCR4
expression and enhanced stroke recovery. To test this hypothesis, the mentee will utilize our Nestin-driven,
tamoxifen inducible LRP1 knockout mouse model and lentiviral expression constructs that rescue portions of
LRP1β both in vitro and in vivo. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the c-terminal domain of LRP1 restores
expression of CXCR4 in NSCs without LRP1. Aim 2 will elucidate the influence of the c-terminal domain of LRP1
on stroke recovery in mice with NSC-specific knockout of LRP1. In addition, this supplement proposes a
rigorous training and career development regime meant to enhance the future career prospects of the
mentee in biological research, whose career goal is to ultimately run an independent research and teaching
program in biomedical sciences. Altogether, this supplement will elucidate specific roles of LRP1 subdomains
on NSC physiology and stroke recovery, enabling more targeted approaches to stroke therapy while promoting
the inclusion and training of an exemplary candidate in neuroscience."

Despite progress in the development of population-specific innovations and culturally-tailored interventions,
disparities in access, receipt, use, and quality of health care delivery persist for populations that have
historically been underserved, underrepresented, and marginalized in dissemination and implementation (D&I)

characterizing determinants of health inequities and disparities in D&I research, which often vary based on
population or issue studied. In addition, we lack systematic tools for identifying and mapping population-
specific and culturally-relevant determinants onto existing implementation constructs (e.g., inner setting,
innovation characteristics). The parent grant (U2CDA057717), the Research Adoption Support Center for the

and validate a health equity taxonomy using mixed methods (i.e., stakeholder engagement, machine learning).
The proposal breaks new ground in the D&I field by leveraging domain expertise (i.e., D&I and health
equity/health disparities) and machine learning (ML) to develop and validate a taxonomy that will serve to
prioritize the needs of those impacted by health disparities and inequities, articulate culturally-relevant and
population-specific determinants known to influence implementation, and heighten researchers’ ability to
assess which health equity issues are being addressed in D&I research and efforts. Specific aims include: 1)
Develop and validate a taxonomy that serves to assess equity-focused D&I efforts; 2) Build, fine-tune, and
evaluate topic models (i.e., unsupervised machine learning models) using off-the-shelf topic modeling
algorithm tools to identify, extract, and describe the most important topics in a sample of HEAL research
abstracts that address underserved populations; 3) Integrate taxonomy with topic modeling results via rapid
feedback with a Board of Domain Experts and the Mentorship Team. The third aim involves collaborating with
the Board of Domain Experts, including stakeholders, and the candidate’s mentorship team to 1) assess
taxonomy completeness by comparing and contrasting taxonomy categories with themes uncovered via topic
modeling, and 2) evaluate consistency between the taxonomy and uncovered topics in terms of co-occurrence
and distribution of topics across categories. The candidate will refine the taxonomy categories based on
feedback from the Board of Domain Experts and return to members for a final review. Results from this project
will inform the development of a centralized public use product that can be utilized by future HD2A studies to
assess key determinants of D&I related to health equity."

One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for interference between similar
memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other
passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While
interference is a factor in relatively benign examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in
clinically-significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental
need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition of similar memories while
minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have
emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation
involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the
potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is agreement that pattern separation is
implemented by the hippocampus—and that it is important for reducing memory interference—there remain
several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In
particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be
recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific
behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We will conduct a
systematic investigation of the contexts in which pattern separation occurs, leveraging sophisticated
neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to characterize patterns of neural activity and to link these patterns of
activity to behavioral expressions of memory. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology
and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models
and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.
In this diversity supplement, we request funding to support Mr. Julian Gamez who recently graduated (B.S.
degree) from the University of Oregon and is preparing to apply to Ph.D. programs. Mr. Gamez will
specifically focus on establishing how memory interference influences the dimensionality of neural
representations of memories and corresponding behavioral expressions. This novel approach will address
competing theoretical accounts and will strongly complement the overall goals of the parent award. It will
also provide an outstanding opportunity for Mr. Gamez to gain expertise learning sophisticated
computational methods and applying these methods to human fMRI and behavioral data."

 Due to advances in biomedical engineering and medicine, joint replacement has restored function
and relieved pain for millions of people. However, subsequent infection of implanted joints (known as
periprosthetic joint infection or PJI) is a debilitating condition that can lead to multiple surgeries, long courses of
intravenous antibiotics, and/or loss of limb or even life. Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common and
virulent organisms that causes PJI. S. aureus is also associated with significant morbidity and frequent relapse
following treatment. Vaccination against S. aureus is a promising strategy to prevent periprosthetic joint
infection. However, traditional vaccine systems designed to prevent S. aureus infection have failed in clinical
trials. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate a novel approach to immunotherapy for S. aureus PJI by
engineering a biomaterials-based vaccine platform (BiVAX). BiVAX is an injectable biodegradable scaffold that
elutes cytokines to recruit dendritic cells, contains adjuvant for activation, and is loaded with antigen at high
concentration for uptake by recruited cells. Our group has previously demonstrated that by using pathogen-
associated molecular patterns as antigen in this biomaterials-based vaccine system, BiVAX is effective against
preventing S. aureus abscesses and lethality from sepsis due to different gram-negative species in mouse
models. PJI is a challenging biofilm-associated device infection, and it is unknown if vaccination can prevent
disease. In this proposal, I will evaluate the effects of infection and vaccination on the host immune response
and determine the efficacy of BiVAX for preventing PJI in murine and rabbit models of disease. I will determine
host immune responses to PJI as a function of immunity and pathogen virulence factors in Aim 1 and evaluate
the effect of BiVAX against PJI and compare its efficacy to conventional vaccination strategies in Aim 2.
 I am supported in these efforts by world experts in immunotherapy, vaccine science, and PJI including:
primary mentor David Mooney (immunoengineering); co-mentor Ruanne Barnabas (vaccine science),
collaborator David Scadden (stem cell biology/immunology); collaborator Jean Lee (murine S. aureus
vaccination); collaborator Michael Super (immunology and glycobiology); advisor Antonia Chen (arthroplasty and
human clinical trials for S. aureus vaccines); advisor Sandra Nelson (clinical periprosthetic joint infection); and
advisor Hang Lee (biostatistics). The resource-rich ecosystem of Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard
University, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering have afforded me the necessary tools to
conduct this multidisciplinary work at the interface of bioengineering, microbiology, and immunology. This
proposal includes a robust training plan designed with my mentors to acquire additional skills in
immunoengineering and vaccine science necessary for launching an independent career investigating
immunity at the host/device/pathogen interface in device-related infection."

Dr. Kavita Dedhia is an assistant professor in otolaryngology at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN) and
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). She has clinical expertise in pediatric otolaryngology, specifically
chronic ear disease. Dr. Dedhia has recently completed the Master in Health Policy Research program at
UPENN through which she gained introductory skills in study design and statistics. Her long-term goal is to
become an independent surgeon-scientist and international leader in pediatric otitis media research. This
career development award serves as a vehicle to achieve this goal by focusing on gaining and refining the
necessary skills to evaluate the effectiveness of surgical otitis media management and patient-centered
outcomes. Otitis media is the 3rd most common reason for pediatric primary care visits, yet evidence for type of
surgical management has been limited. Most studies lack sociodemographic and regional diversity, have high
attrition and cross-over rates, and infrequent assessment of patient-reported outcomes. The aims outlined in
this proposal will serve to improve evidence optimizing surgical otitis media management, through using the
PEDSnet learning health system. PEDSnet is a clinical network consisting of electronic health record data from
11 of the largest pediatric institutions throughout the United States. Using PEDSnet, a clinical consortium of
pediatric otolaryngologists will be formed to assist in carrying out the aims. Aim 1 will evaluate the
effectiveness of adjuvant adenoidectomy and heterogeneity of treatment effect based on age and medical
conditions at-risk for developmental delay through analyzing the PEDSnet dataset from 11 institutions. Aim 2
will be a prospective cohort study at CHOP that will account for patient and environmental factors not available
within the PEDSnet dataset to assess adjuvant adenoidectomy effectiveness. Input for study design and data
collection will be obtained from the pediatric otolaryngology consortium. This study will assess patient
recruitment, retention, uniform data collection rigor, reproducibility, and estimate effect sizes for a larger scale
multi-institutional study at all PEDSnet sites. To carry-out the abovementioned aims, the candidate has formed
a strong mentorship team. Her primary mentor, Dr. Christopher Forrest, is the founder of PEDSnet and adept
in utilizing the learning health system model in pediatric outcomes research. Her co-mentors are equally
impressive: Dr. Gregory Tasian is an expert in pragmatic trials and has formed a pediatric urology clinical
network for studying pediatric urological disease, Dr Yong Chen has extensive expertise in medical informatics,
causal inference, and comparative effectiveness research; and Dr. Diego Preciado is a pediatric
otolaryngology surgeon-scientist who is an expert on otitis media research. The proposed plan will allow the
candidate to become proficient in informatics, causal inference, comparative effectiveness, advanced statistical
analysis, and pragmatic clinical trials to allow for a successful career as an independent surgeon-scientist."

Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for individuals to pursue treatments and plan for the future.
Unfortunately, AD is underdiagnosed in community settings compared to the estimated prevalence from
longitudinal cohort studies. AD underdiagnosis is exacerbated in understudied populations, including
Hispanic/Latino (HL) and non-Hispanic African American (NH-AfAm) groups. Mining patients’ electronic health
records (EHR) using machine learning may help identify patients with undiagnosed AD.
 Prior studies have identified individual comorbidities associated with AD. However, patients accumulate
disease conditions sequentially accumulate over time. These pathways of disease accumulation are known as
disease trajectories. Few studies have investigated disease trajectories in AD and none have comprehensively
evaluated them in understudied populations. Disease trajectories derived from the EHR have the potential to
predict undiagnosed AD as the next diagnosis follows from the prior diagnoses. Current models that predict AD
do not utilize disease trajectories or account for AD underdiagnosis. EHR data can be complemented by genetics
to determine AD risk. Incorporating polygenic risk with EHR data to identify undiagnosed AD has not been
evaluated.
 To address these challenges, our objectives are to identify undiagnosed AD in non-Hispanic white (NH-
white), HL, and NH-AfAm groups utilizing disease trajectories and genetics followed by validation and replication.
We leverage existing resources from millions of patients with EHR and hundreds of thousands with genetic data
linked to the EHR. We propose the following aims. Aim 1 will identify disease trajectories in AD. Aim 2 will identify
undiagnosed AD based on disease trajectory while mitigating the bias of underdiagnosis in HL and NH-AfAm
groups. We will validate patients predicted to have undiagnosed AD via multiple outcome measures and replicate
our results in another EHR cohort, All of Us. Aim 3 will integrate polygenic risk with disease trajectories to detect
undiagnosed AD. We will validate these patients predicted to have undiagnosed AD via multiple outcome
measures, and replicate our results in All of Us.
 This proposal aligns with our long-term goal to realize precision medicine in dementias for all racial and ethnic
groups by leveraging EHR, genomics, and computational tools. Our contributions will enable the application of
disease trajectories in precision medicine, the detection of undiagnosed AD at UCLA and other health systems,
and future work to reduce the bias of underdiagnosis in understudied populations."

Overview: This research study will leverage established datasets from nationwide longitudinal lung studies to characterize
multi-volume mechanical changes affecting airway and chest wall pathophysiology in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) in the presence of emphysema, small airway disease, low bone density, and sarcopenia. Emphysema, air
trapping, airway counts and geometry, and multi-volume determined metrics of functional small airway disease (fSAD)
have been well investigated. However, changes in airway and chest wall deformation between two lung volumes in COPD
and their interactions in the presence of different comorbidities have not been explored. This study will characterize
unique subtypes of COPD-related abnormalities in airway and chest wall deformation between inspiratory and
expiratory lung volumes, identify their associations in COPD and comorbidities, and assess their impacts on disease
progression and clinical outcomes. Methods: Inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scans will be used to define metrics of
transverse (Δair-T) and longitudinal (Δair-L) airway deformation and caudocranial (Δwall-CC) and mediolateral (Δwall-ML)
chest wall deformation between two lung volumes. Data of healthy never-smokers in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis Lung (MESALung) will be used to build normative models of different deformation metrics. Genetic
Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study data will be used to characterize different subtypes of abnormalities in multi-
volume airway and chest wall deformation in COPD. This project will achieve three aims. Aim 1 develops normative
models of airway and chest wall deformation metrics, computes participant- and metric-specific standardized scores of
deviations from expected values and identifies unique subtypes of lung volume associated airway and chest wall
deformation in COPD. Aim 2 characterizes the associations of airway and chest wall subtypes in COPD with demographics,
disease severity, radiographic markers, physical activity, smoking status and history, low bone density, and sarcopenia.
Aim 3 investigates the associations of 5-year lung function change and clinical outcome metrics with different airway and
chest wall subtypes. Novelty: (i) Characterization of novel subtypes of abnormalities in multi-volume airway and chest
wall deformation in COPD and assessment of their clinical relevance. (ii) Automation of multi-volume CT-based airway
and chest wall deformation metrics. (iii) Normative models of airway and chest wall deformation metrics. Strengths:
Established longitudinal data repositories, multi-disciplinary expertise of the research team, and strong preliminary data.
Deliverables and Significance: (i) CT-based characterization of new airway and chest wall deformation subtypes will
facilitate understanding mechanical changes affecting airway and chest wall pathophysiology and their associations with
COPD comorbidities and assessment of their impacts on disease progression and clinical outcomes. (ii) Automation of CT-
based metrics of multi-volume airway and chest wall deformation will enable translation of the study findings to large
research and clinical collections of chest CT scans. (iii) Normative models will offer references to characterize mechanical
changes affecting airway and chest wall pathophysiology in various thoracic diseases."

Glioblastoma represents one of the most lethal types of cancers. Despite extensive molecular
characterization, precision medicine efforts have largely failed for glioblastoma therapy, suggesting that these
complex tumors are resilient ecosystems that overcome singular therapeutic approaches. Aging is strongly
associated with increased incidence and mortality of most cancers, including glioblastoma. However, the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which aging promotes tumor initiation and progression remain poorly
understood. Tissue-specific stem cells contribute to development, renewal, and regeneration of most organs.
Neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo little to no cell division during normal homeostasis but become activated
by tissue injury with wound responses. NSCs reside in specialized niches that provide maintenance cues
and regulate the balance between quiescence and proliferation. Inflammation and nutrient constraints in NSC
niches in the aging brain promotes quiescence and decreased regenerative potential.
Like the normal brain, glioblastomas contain cellular hierarchies with stem-like tumor cells at the apex. While
controversial, these cancer stem cells contribute to therapeutic resistance, invasion into normal brain,
generation of new vasculature, and evasion of anti-tumor immunity. Cancer stem cells display remarkable
plasticity, rendering therapeutic targeting strategies challenging. In the proposed studies, the Rich laboratory
will leverage insights from aging in the nervous system and the molecular circuitry of cancer stem cells to
understand how aging promotes tumor growth through cell autonomous mechanisms and interactions with
the microenvironment. We will leverage preliminary observations that cancer stem cells reprogram essential
metabolic pathways through integration of extrinsic signals from tumor-infiltrating immune cells and
vasculature to promote epigenetic reprogramming, empowering sustained proliferation, self-renewal, and
immune evasion. Based on this background, we hypothesize that aging promotes reprogramming of the
tumor immune microenvironment and cell autonomous nuclear structural regulation that will inform the
development of novel brain tumor treatments. Using spatial transcriptomics and metabolomics of patient
tumors and organoids, we will investigate the metabolic alterations within the aging tumor microenvironment
to derive multi-modal therapies that disrupt the dynamic growth and survival mechanisms within tumors."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is characterized by recurrent drug-taking behaviors that often resemble the renewal-induced relapse after a successful extinction-based therapy. This inability of transferring the learned extinction as the subjects are re-exposed to the original drug context (i.e., their homes) is associated with deficits in neural regions such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which regulates the extinction of drug-associated memories and its ability to maintain voluntary abstinence. For instance, addicts developing addiction in a particular context “A” may extinguish the responses for drug-associated cues in a clinical context “B”, but when re-exposed to the same cues in context “A”, fail to transfer the learned extinction to suppress the context-induced renewal/relapse. Thus, because the ability to cease drug-seeking relies on overcoming drug-associated memories, extinction represents a preclinical opportunity to characterize and manipulate the molecular substrates underlying drug-seeking behavior to overcome the renewal-associated relapse. While drug self-administration (SA) leads to numerous neuroplasticity changes in the reward circuit, little is known about the impact of extinction training in reprogramming the addiction-relevant behavioral and transcriptomic codes/outcomes of the brain reward circuit. Together, these research questions pose a platform to delineate my current personal and professional training plan, which will be applied as I transition to a faculty position. Under the tutelage of my primary mentors (Drs. Eric Nestler: sponsor and Paul Kenny: co-sponsor) and my mentoring committee (Drs. Mary Kay Lobo, Yavin Shaham, Li Shen and Fabricio Do Monte), I will use RNA-sequencing of NAc subregions (core and shell) of rats receiving cocaine-SA and contextual extinction (AAA vs ABA) or withdrawal (no extinction) procedures, to characterize the drug-associated memories (phenotypes; renewal vs. extinction), at the transcriptional level (Aim 1). Subsequently, to manipulate the resulting behaviors, I will be targeting the transcriptome of NAc subregions and cell types. Specifically, I will design novel viral vectors to perform viral-mediated gene transfer to manipulate a top hub gene (i.e., transcription factor) previously proven or newly deduced as a main driver of renewal-induced relapse (failure of extinction transfer) in a subregion and cell-specific manner in NAc. As for the cell-specific manipulations, I will be utilizing the novel transgenic rat model expressing Cre-recombinase in dopamine D1 or D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) (Aim 2). Purposely, because life situations involving conflict between abstaining from or taking a drug due to adverse consequences are a key feature of relapse, I will test the impact of extinction training on restoring adaptive decisions in a conflict-based model (Aim 3), where drug seeking leads to punishable outcomes (i.e., footshocks), to delve deeper into the neurobiology of extinction/renewal that is most relevant to people."

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is the pre-malignant expansion of a population of blood cells derived from a single
hematopoietic stem cell and is often caused by somatic mutations in leukemia driver genes. CH has been
associated with significant clinical outcomes including hematologic cancers, various inflammatory
comorbidities, and increased all-cause mortality. Among individuals with CH, there is inconsistent penetrance
for inflammatory disease symptoms and risk of inflammatory disease varies widely. Reliable clinically-validated
models that estimate a patient’s risk of inflammatory disease outcomes and management strategies that
prevent or effectively overcome inflammatory disease outcomes in CH are major medical needs. The goal of
this proposal is to define and better understand the relationship between CH and inflammatory disease
outcomes. Aim 1 will define the association between CH and rheumatologic diseases and activities in Aim 2
will define the CH genotypes most powerfully linked to inflammatory phenotypes and generate a statistical
algorithm to estimate individual risk of inflammatory disease in patients with CH. Then, using a cohort of
patients with clonal cytopenia of uncertain significant (CCUS), a subtype of CH, who have been exposed to
hypomethylating agents (HMA), Aim 3 will explore the influence of HMA therapy on inflammatory disease
symptoms. Collectively, this work will enable the identification of patients with CH who are at risk for
inflammatory diseases and provide preliminary data to motivate future interventional clinical trials with
endpoints designed around prevention of inflammatory disease outcomes. Dr. Lachelle D. Weeks is a
hematologist and scientist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and translational investigator in the
Division of Population Sciences within the Department of Medical Oncology at DFCI. She spends 80% of her
time in translational research and 20% in clinical practice caring for and counseling patients with CH and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In addition to her primary mentor, Dr. Weeks has established an advisory
committee of internationally recognized experts in CH, myeloid malignancies, clinical computational oncology,
and genetic epidemiology. Her research and career development activities will be conducted at DFCI which
has an outstanding research community and a long track record for successful mentorship of independent
scientists. This is an ideal environment for completion of the proposed research, execution of the proposed
career development strategy, and the ultimate realization of Dr. Weeks’s long-term career goal of becoming an

Asymmetric cell division (ACD) plays a critical role in fate specification and morphogenesis during development.
This process is also crucial for tissue homeostasis and repair in adulthood. Dys-regulation of ACD results in
developmental/intellectual disabilities and tumorigenesis, making it critical to understand the underlying cellular
and molecular mechanisms.
 A critical aspect of ACD is the establishment of cell polarity. Studies in invertebrate systems have
identified important cortical polarity regulators, which ensure proper segregation of fate determinants into two
daughter cells. These studies further shed light on how distinct protein complexes establish and maintain their
reciprocal cortical polarity. Despite these advances, how cortically localized proteins polarize non-cortically
distributed cell fate determinants is not well understood. Research into vertebrate systems has begun to uncover
new insights into the function of these evolutionarily conserved polarity regulators. Radial glia progenitors
(RGPs), the principal vertebrate neural stem cells (NSCs), represent a model cell type as they predominantly
undergo ACD during active neurogenesis to balance self-renewal and differentiation. Our prior work shows that
in embryonic zebrafish forebrain RGPs, the key cortical polarity regulator Par-3 is critical to establish asymmetric
Notch signaling activity in daughter cells. It remains unknown how Par-3 establishes such asymmetry.
 Recently, we uncover, for the first time to our knowledge, that Par-3 is present in the cytosol and
associates with the dynein motor complex on Notch ligand-containing endosomes. Together, Par-3 and dynein
are required in the mother RGP to directionally transport Notch ligand-containing endosomes to the self-
renewing daughter. Additionally, we discover that cortical Par-3 domain shifts from apical at interphase toward
posterior during mitosis, to align with cell division orientation along the anteroposterior embryonic axis.
 In this application, we wish to build upon these new findings to address the following questions: 1) how
does Par-3 work together with dynein to direct polarized dynamics of Notch ligand-containing endosomes? 2)
what is the dynamic relationship between cortical and cytoplasmic Par-3? 3) What mechanisms reconstruct the
axis of Par-3 polarity from apicobasal during interphase to anterior-posterior during mitosis? Our central
hypothesis is that both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms operate to reshape Par-3 cortical polarity; this cortical
polarity then sets up a polarized cytoplasmic gradient of Par-3, which in turn directly facilitates endosome
dynamics by activating dynein.
 The proposed work is expected to yield significant new insights into asymmetric division and neural stem
cell fate regulation during vertebrate brain development. These findings should have a positive impact on
revealing fundamental principles and laying groundwork for elucidating disease etiology and stimulating new
therapeutic development."

pressure monitoring, preventive care, problem solving, appointment reminders, administrative messages; and
Optional Messaging: A library of patient-selected modules (e.g. nutrition, physical activity, weight management,
emotional coping, goal setting) designed to motivate and educate.
AIM 2: Conduct a randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial with 400 Veterans whose diabetes
was uncontrolled (defined as HbA1c over 8.0% for at least 50% of the most recent 6 months) in 2018 in
Gainesville, FL or Chicago, IL. The primary aim will be to assess the comparative effectiveness of DD-TXT
compared to DSE, a diabetes skills education-only texting protocol based on a skills workbook that is currently
given to VA patients with diabetes. The primary outcome will be HbA1c percent time in control. Secondary
outcomes include self-reported adherence to diabetes self-care recommendations (SCI-R), diabetes self-
efficacy, diabetes distress, LDL, and blood pressure control. We hypothesize that DD-TXT will result in better
proximal health outcomes and diabetes self-management behaviors vs an education-only protocol (DSE).

This proposal seeks funding to acquire four Techniplast Digital VenƟlated Cage (DVC) Isocage NegaƟve
systems, a crucial step in upgrading mouse housing and improving husbandry pracƟces while
simultaneously enhancing animal welfare in our shared Animal Biosafety Level 3 (ABSL3) Plus Select
Agent program at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH). SJCRH's ambiƟous strategic plan for the
ﬁscal years 2022‐2027 outlines a substanƟal 54% increase in faculty members (from 91 to 140) expected
to uƟlize in vivo research resources. This expansion is aligned with the insƟtuƟon's mission to establish a
world‐leading research eﬀort in infecƟous diseases that aﬀect children. To achieve this goal, we intend to
recruit sixteen new faculty members who specialize in laboratory‐based research on infecƟous diseases
and immunity. They will complement the exisƟng faculty of nine, who are engaged in cuƫng‐edge
research in areas such as inﬂuenza, SARS‐CoV2, pneumococcal infecƟons, viral and bacterial
therapeuƟcs, and the funcƟons of adapƟve and innate immunity during these infecƟons. AddiƟonally,
SJCRH serves as one of the collaboraƟng centers for the World Health OrganizaƟon's Global Inﬂuenza
Response and Surveillance System, funcƟoning as the Center for Studies on the Ecology of Inﬂuenza in
Animals and Birds. Moreover, our program is funded as a Center of Excellence for Inﬂuenza Research and
Response (CEIRR) through grants from the NaƟonal InsƟtute of Allergy and InfecƟous Diseases (NIAID).
Considering these commitments and aﬃliaƟons, the ABSL3 facility plays a pivotal role in supporƟng
these criƟcal iniƟaƟves. The primary objecƟve of this project is to replace the aging Mouse
Biocontainment Individually VenƟlated Caging (IVC) system, which was procured back in 2002. We aim to
replace it with the state‐of‐the‐art Techniplast DVC system, which oﬀers real‐Ɵme monitoring of rack
blower funcƟons, intra‐cage condiƟons, and animal acƟvity. This conƟnuous monitoring will allow for the
opƟmizaƟon of husbandry pracƟces and improved veterinary care, ulƟmately leading to more humane
endpoints. Furthermore, it will facilitate the Ɵmely collecƟon of Ɵssue and ﬂuid samples and data,
especially in situaƟons when access to the facility is restricted—such as weekends, holidays, or during
severe weather‐related conƟngencies that can aﬀect staﬃng levels. The DVC racks come with four Ɵmes
the backup baƩery life (up to 36 hours) compared to the current system. The DVC system oﬀers detailed

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized as a serious and debilitating
problem in adolescent and adult females, with impairment and comorbidity in female patients with ADHD
increasing dramatically around puberty. Given the deleterious consequences of ADHD and substantial
comorbidities in this group, there is an urgent need to understand sex-specific factors contributing to symptom
expression in this understudied population. One promising but understudied factor is ovarian hormones which
become activated around puberty and fluctuate monthly in adulthood. To date, no study outside of our lab has
examined the effects of estrogen and progesterone changes on ADHD symptoms in female patients, but basic
science data from animal studies provide a strong scientific premise for this work. These studies date back 20
years and suggest that withdrawal from—and lower levels of—estradiol, the predominant estrogen, cause
cognitive and attention problems, based on experimental work with ovariectomized rats. In fact, we have pilot
data establishing the basic scientific premise and feasibility of this study design showing declines in estrogen
predict worsening response inhibition and working memory and increases in ADHD symptoms in a clinical
sample of female patients with ADHD. Yet, it remains unclear what accounts for these effects at the
neurobiological level in humans, despite animal work showing estrogen effects on dopamine and human work
in female heavy drinkers showing estrogen effects on insular brain activation patterns during response
inhibition tasks. The current project aims to use an innovative, quasi-experimental, and intensive longitudinal
menstrual cycle study design to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms of estrogen effects on neural
mechanisms of cognition and ADHD symptoms in a clinical sample of 120 young adult female patients ages 18
to 25 with ADHD. The project will evaluate whether menstrual cycle phase and hormonal effects on the neural
circuitry involved in response inhibition and working memory predict short-term longitudinal change in ADHD
symptoms and medication response in young adult females with ADHD. This work is a critical extension of our
preliminary data, which found cycle phase and hormonal effects on ADHD and response inhibition and working
memory but did not evaluate neural mechanisms or hormonal effects on treatment response. The long-term
goal of this project is to test whether medication titration or hormone stabilization across menstrual cycle phase
or reproductive phase improves ADHD symptoms and normalizes underlying neurocognitive and biological
mechanisms in females. Such information is critical to advancing neurobiological theory of ADHD and
suggesting new avenues for personalized, sex-specific assessment and psychopharmacological treatment of
ADHD, which may need to be targeted to cycle or reproductive phase, hormonal profiles, and impacted
neurofunctional regions in pharmacotherapies."

The Biomedical Research Support Facility (BRSF) is an essential core facility at Oakland University (OU).
Investigators from six different departments and campus units rely on it to conduct basic and applied research.
Originally constructed in 1999 (with support from NIH funding), it has been continually in use since OU took
occupancy the following year.
Not only has the building aged in terms of its mechanical systems and physical infrastructure, we are placing
even heavier demands on it than ever before, precisely at the time when its systems are beginning to fail. Of the
19 investigators with current approved projects running in BRSF, nearly half of them were hired within the last
three years.
This is particularly true of the two autoclaves supporting research and day-to-day operations in BRSF. We have
a large Getinge Castle M/C 3633 autoclave in the cage processing area that has not been operable for some
time due to an ongoing inability to secure replacements for parts that have failed or worn out. A smaller Getinge
Castle Model 133 autoclave with a bioseal is still operating between the (clean) anteroom and the (contaminated)
procedures room in the BRSF biocontainment suite, but it suffers from the same problem in terms of replacement
parts. This smaller autoclave is also increasingly used for research: two of our newly hired investigators each
use adenovirus or lentivirus particles for transfection; another of our researchers works with stem cell
therapeutics; a fourth does microbiological and gross anatomical work in rodent models of colitis. All four
research teams generate medical waste that must be decontaminated before it is disposed of.
OU has committed more than $1.2 million this fiscal year to replace the obsolete boilers and both the cage and
tunnel washers in BRSF. This proposal seeks funding to replace the two autoclaves as well – since they connect
to many of the same systems, it makes sense to tackle these replacements at or near the same time, to minimize
the need for repeated service interruptions that will also impact ongoing research underway in BRSF.
We have selected replacement models that are very similar to the obsolescent instruments they are designed to
replace. The replacement instruments are much the same size as the existing models, use mostly the same size
connections, and have roughly similar power requirements – one of several factors that influenced our choice
for replacements. We are also requesting water-saving packages on both of the replacement instruments, as
part of OU's sustainability initiative. We anticipate saving as much as 20,000 gallons of water annually with the
replacement instruments, even with the increased load as our biomedical research enterprise expands."
10997168,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease that afflicts over 500 million people worldwide
and causes nearly 1.5 million deaths each year. Diabetics are hospitalized at a more frequent rate and have
more expensive hospital visits compared to the general population. Current antibiotic-based treatments for
infection contribute to the global rise in antimicrobial resistance and cause dysbiosis of the endogenous
microbiome, leading to an adverse susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, additional strategies to prevent and cure
bacterial infection are desperately needed. The vaginal microbiome is a key reservoir for pathogen
dissemination to the urinary tract and a guardian against translocation to distant body sites by maintaining
epithelial integrity and controlling inflammation. Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a bacterium that is frequently
detected in the vaginal microbiome without symptoms, but it is also an under-reported cause of aerobic
vaginitis. In the diabetic population, which is 95% type 2 diabetics, GBS causes invasive disease in ~6,000
diabetic women annually and disproportionately causes urinary tract infections. However, neither the T2D
vaginal microbiome nor its influence on diabetic susceptibility to this pathogen have been studied. Previous
research suggest that the gut microbiome can respond to metabolic disease; in some cases diabetes is
associated with enrichment of opportunistic pathogens in the gut or dysbiotic gut bacteria that are vulnerable to
pathogens. In the context of pregnancy, gestational diabetes is associated with enriched abundance of
opportunistic pathogens in the vaginal microbiome. This proposal aims to understand whether metabolic
disease impacts the vaginal microbiome outside of pregnancy and whether microbiota mediate diabetic
susceptibility to GBS. We hypothesize that T2D patients will have an altered microbiome and metabolite
composition and an inflammatory cytokine profile, and that diabetic-derived communities will be less protective
against GBS and concurrently inflict damage and inflammation on the host epithelium. This hypothesis will be
tested by the following specific aims: 1) Define homeostatic characteristics of the vaginal microenvironment in
T2D, and 2) Characterize T2D vaginal microbiome interactions with GBS and mediation of pathogen-host
interactions. To complete these aims, innovative approaches such as miniature bioreactor cultivation and
human vaginal stem-cell derived organoids will be used. The research will provide the applicant with training in
organoid models, transcriptomics and metabolomics, and whole genome and 16S analysis, while building upon
the applicant’s experience with the miniature bioreactor model. This training will take place at Baylor College of
Medicine with mentorship from leading experts in metabolic disease, host-microbe interactions, human
microbiome, and both proposed model systems, miniature bioreactors and organoids. This research will
identify components of the vaginal microenvironment that influence diabetic susceptibility to GBS infections
and provide new tools for targeted therapeutic alternatives to antibiotics."
10997169,"Abstract
There are numerous examples of endogenous and exogenous particle-induced chronic inflammation. One model
of chronic environmentally-induced inflammation is driven by exposure to crystalline silica particles. There are
various occupational lung diseases that arise from exposure to exogenous particles such as asbestos fibers and
crystalline silica (cSiO2) leading to chronic inflammation and lung fibrosis, however there are insufficient
treatment options. A commonality of particle-induced inflammation is lysosome membrane permeabilization
(LMP), in macrophages. Previous studies have shown that cSiO2-induced LMP allows lysosomal enzymes to
leak out into the cytosol where they can trigger cell death pathways and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, a
multiprotein complex that is responsible for the processing and release of IL-1β from macrophages. IL-1β is a
potent proinflammatory cytokine that is involved in nearly all models of chronic inflammation and subsequent
diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of cSiO2-induced LMP and downstream IL-1β release could
provide information for identifying novel therapies that target chronic inflammation. The goal of this proposal is
to further elucidate the interactions between cSiO2 particles and the inner lysosomal membrane leading to LMP
with the ultimate goal of blocking LMP and downstream inflammation. Current research suggests that
sphingomyelin metabolism mediates numerous vital and pathological cell processes. My preliminary results
suggest that disruptions in sphingomyelin metabolism can prevent cSiO2-induced IL-1β release in macrophages
and change the lipid content of isolated lysosomes by increasing sphingomyelin and cholesterol levels while
decreasing ceramide. However, critical details are still needed to fully characterize the involvement of
sphingomyelin metabolism in cSiO2-induced inflammation. Furthermore, the biophysical changes induced by
cSiO2 on model membranes have been described but not in isolated lysosomes. Therefore, the studies proposed
in this work will elucidate the biophysical changes caused by cSiO2 in isolated lysosome membranes that result
in LMP and determine the involvement of sphingomyelin metabolism by comprehensively analyzing changes to
the lipid profile of isolated lysosomes using a lipidomics approach. Finally, by using multiple inhibitory techniques
to disrupt sphingomyelin metabolism at specific steps, previously unexplained mechanistic details of cSiO2-
induced inflammation and cell death will be determined. Taken together, these novel studies will provide new
information on mechanisms of particle-induced activation of macrophages that will provide potential new
therapeutic targets."
10997172,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. Ninety five percent of AD cases
are sporadic late onset (LOAD) of unknown cause. Aging is the greatest risk factor of LOAD. Pathologically, AD
is characterized by brain aggregates of β-amyloid (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles. Clinically it is characterized
by progressive memory loss and cognitive deficits. Hippocampal-dependent episodic memory is the earliest
deficit to be clinically detected and the most severely impaired throughout disease progression. Adult
hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is an integral process for hippocampal memory formation that occurs in the
dentate gyrus (DG). We and others have shown that AHN is impaired in AD mouse models and patients. Several
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified PICALM, the gene encoding for Phosphatidylinositol
Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein, as a genetic risk factor for LOAD. However, how PICALM polymorphism
induces pathology and memory loss is yet to be fully understood. My preliminary studies show that PICALM is
expressed in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs) in the mouse hippocampus, as well as in neurons derived
from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and its expression appears to be stage-specific. Further,
knocking out PICALM in iPSC- derived neural progenitor cells, precursors and new neurons reduced levels of b-
III-tubulin and neurofilament, suggesting that PICALM regulates neuronal maturation. Additionally, the ratio
between the mature and immature form of b-Amyloid precursor protein (b-APP) was altered in PICALM KO cells
throughout neurogenesis stages, suggesting that PICALM regulates b-APP metabolism. Interestingly, levels of
PICALM in the hippocampus of adult mice are significantly reduced with age, while its cleavage products are
increased. Thus, we hypothesize that PICALM regulates AHN and b-APP metabolism, and that altered
expression of PICALM in NSPCs in LOAD impairs AHN and contributes to amyloidosis and
hippocampus-dependent memory deficits. To address this hypothesis, experiments in Aim 1 will examine
the role of PICALM in AHN using a conditional knockout of PICALM in AHN in mice and determine its role in
AHN-dependent learning and memory. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of PICALM in impaired neurogenesis and
amyloidosis in AD in iPSC- derived human forebrain neurons harboring PICALM polymorphisms and PICALM
knockout. These experiments will provide new information about a novel regulator of hippocampal neurogenesis
and a mechanism by which AHN is impaired in LOAD and contributes to pathology and memory loss."
10990206,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, a subset of patients, particularly those with
squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) found in the skin, oral cavity, larynx, esophagus, lung, and cervix, exhibit
varying responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), resulting in a 60% relapse rate. These disparities in
patient outcomes strongly suggest the existence of genetic variations that underlie their distinct responses to
ICB. Although the specific oncogenic mutations responsible for driving relapse in SCC patients remain unclear,
it is imperative to grasp the mechanisms of cancer immune evasion in individuals with specific genetic profiles
to enhance the precision of immunotherapy. Recent research has identified a population of tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) within skin and oral cavity SCCs that resist anti-tumor immunity and drive relapse. These rare TICs are
often overlooked in tumor immunology studies despite their critical role in promoting cancer recurrence. We have
identified that activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, found in 20% of cutaneous and head and neck SCCs,
can enhance stemness and intrinsic immune resistance in SCCs, resulting in rapid relapse after ICB. The
proposed research will consist of two main aims. The F99 phase aims to determine how PIK3CA mutations
expand the immune-resistant TICs in SCC tumors. I will investigate whether PIK3CA activating mutations induce
TIC self-renewal and dedifferentiation following ICB treatment. I will explore the role PIK3CA mutants have on
the Sox2 protein, a critical transcription factor for maintaining stemness, and its stability in TICs. This aim will
provide insights into the ability to disrupt PIK3CA mutant-induced Sox2 stability to reduce SCC relapse after
immunotherapy. The K00 phase is broader with the goal of identifying how genetic alterations enhance the
intrinsic immune resistance of TICs. In the first part of the K00 phase, I will design a genome-wide CRISPR
screen to identify candidate genes responsible for endowing PIK3CA mutant TICs with resistance to T cell-
mediated ferroptosis. I will explore how PIK3CA mutations reprogram the metabolism of TICs to enhance their
intrinsic resistance to T cell-induced ferroptosis. I will then expand the scope to identify other genetic
determinants beyond PIK3CA mutations that drive immune evasion in TICs. By CRISPR gene editing, I will
introduce other oncogene activation, tumor suppressor inactivation, chromosomal rearrangements, gene
fusions, and copy number variations into keratinocytes and evaluate their potential to promote immune evasion
in vivo. This work will discover potential drug targets and biomarkers for predicting patient responses to
immunotherapy. My ultimate goal is to become an independent investigator at a leading research institution and
to conduct interdisciplinary, NIH-funded research contributing to the fields of cancer biology, stem cell biology,
and immunology, and by characterizing novel mechanisms of cancer stem cell-specific immune resistance."
10990668,"Asthma causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the U.S., particularly among African American emerging
adults (AAEA; ages 18-30), but very few asthma programs have targeted this population. Interventions that
provide education and address underlying motivation for managing asthma may be most effective. However,
intensive, face-to-face interventions are often difficult to implement, especially among emerging adults. The
purpose of this proposal is to develop an effective mobile asthma management intervention to improve control
in AAEA. We will assess the ability of multiple technologic components to assist and improve traditional
asthma education: 1) MES. The Motivational Enhancement System (MES) for Asthma Management is a
mobile 4-session intervention utilizing supported self-regulation and Motivational Interviewing (MI).
Personalized content is based on each participant’s activity level, daily experiences, and goals. 2) SA.
Supportive accountability (SA) is administered by asthma nurses utilizing targeted mobile support (Skype/voice
calls) to provide education, promote self-efficacy, and overcome barriers through an MI-based framework. 3)
SMS. Text messaging (SMS) provides reminders for asthma education, medication adherence, and physical
activity. 4) PAT. Physical activity tracking (PAT) uses wearable technology to help meet user-defined physical
activity goals. Using a multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework, we will test these 4 intervention
components and combination of components to identify the most effective mobile intervention. MOST is an
innovative, cost- and time-effective framework that utilizes engineering principles to produce effective
behavioral interventions. We will conduct a component selection experiment using a factorial research design
to build an intervention that has been optimized for maximum efficacy. We will use a clinically significant
improvement in asthma control as the criterion for determining which components should be kept in the
optimized intervention. Participants (N=180) will be randomized to 1 of 6 intervention arms consisting of
various combinations of the intervention components. This experimental design is equivalent to conducting
multiple pilot randomized clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of each component, yet uses only a fraction of
the sample size and resources. At the completion of the study, we will have an empirically-supported,
optimized mobile asthma management intervention to improve asthma control for AAEA. Participants will be
recruited from multiple sites of the American Lung Association Airway Clinical Research Center network and
ambulatory care clinics at the Detroit Medical Center. Data collections will occur at baseline, 3, 6, and 12
months. We hypothesize that post-intervention (3, 6, and 12 months), participants with uncontrolled asthma will
show clinically-significant improvement in asthma control. We hypothesize that improvements in asthma
management behaviors (including physical activity), quality of life, symptoms, adherence, and exacerbations
(secondary outcomes) will also be observed."

The overall goal of this research is to better understand how endogenous opioids control the analgesic properties
of the central noradrenergic system. Endogenous opioid systems provide powerful inhibition of locus coeruleus
noradrenergic neurons and acute activation of mu opioid receptors in the locus coeruleus is antinociceptive.
Therefore, we hypothesized that this endogenous mu opioid receptor-mediated inhibition could be critical to how
the locus coeruleus modulates pain. Using conditional knockout and rescue of locus coeruleus-mu opioid
receptor signaling, we show that the presence of these receptors in locus coeruleus neurons following
neuropathic injury can reverse the expression of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. However, it is
it is unknown whether the locus coeruleus-mu opioid receptor system is differentially modulated in pain states.
This research focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which endogenous opioids inhibit the locus
coeruleus noradrenergic system to promote endogenous analgesia and how chronic neuropathic injury disrupts
this system. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that loss of mu opioid receptor-mediated locus coeruleus
inhibition following long-term neuropathic injury promotes and maintains chronic pain. The first aim of this
proposal will use neurochemical and gene expression studies to determine how endogenous opioid ligand and
receptor systems in the locus coeruleus evolve following long-term neuropathic injury. The second aim seeks to
understand whether projections from the locus coeruleus to the medial prefrontal cortex are selectively
disinhibited after injury. This aim seeks to determine whether opioid sensitivity in these neurons is decreased in
chronic pain. To do so we will use a high-throughput calcium imaging assay and in vivo optogenetics test the
function of locus coeruleus neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex. The final aim seeks to identify
non-opioid strategies for inhibiting the locus coeruleus to discover new analgesic targets. These studies will
define the role of locus coeruleus mu opioid receptors 1) in pain from neuropathic injury, 2) along projections to
the medial prefrontal cortex, and 3) identify mechanisms to suppress pain-generating locus coeruleus activity.
This information will be critical for translational research targeting the noradrenergic system in the treatment of
pain and neuropsychiatric disorders."

The problem: Early childhood caries (ECC) is a lead health problem affecting children. More than half a billion
children worldwide have untreated tooth decay. Pain, impaired nutrition, reduction in school productivity, and
significant costs for care are some of the negative impacts of this disease. The reduced quality of life, morbidity
and even mortality are unacceptable consequences of ECC. Because caries is caused by the metabolism of
dietary sugars by a cariogenic biofilm, it is very difficult to control; the widespread consumption of fermentable
sugars in modern diets favors cariogenic species such as Streptococcus mutans and the opportunistic fungi
Candida albicans in the dental biofilm, perpetuating the caries process. Fluoride is the most effective agent for
caries control, but it has very limited antimicrobial effects because most microbes have membrane proteins to
expel fluoride and keep intracellular concentrations at sub-inhibitory levels. Different oral microbial species
possess different types of fluoride exporters; S. mutans and C. albicans employ CLCF and FEX proteins,
respectively, while beneficial oral streptococci use Fluc proteins. This creates an opportunity to specifically
target pathogenic oral microbes to modify species dynamics towards health-associated symbiotic communities
in biofilms exposed to sugar and fluoride. In this project a team of specialists in structural biology, cariology
and modeling and prediction of microbial systems will develop a new class of anticaries therapy, leveraging the
species-specific susceptibilities to fluoride to create treatments that revert the cariogenic biofilm dysbiosis,
under the same level of fluoride exposure currently available through toothpastes/mouth rinses. This will be
pursued under the following specific aims: S.A.#1: A multiscale approach to develop fluoride efflux inhibitor
treatments for dental pathogens; S.A.#2: A data-driven approach to tailor fluoride-based therapies to patient-
specific oral dysbiosis. Significance: This collaborative effort will develop novel, effective fluoride efflux
inhibitors that potentiate the antimicrobial effects of fluoride ion and inhibit growth of oral pathogens, to treat
oral dysbiosis and eliminate ECC. This study will also establish methods to predict the effect of different
treatments according to the patient's specific oral dysbiosis, so that personalized treatment regimens can be
used to maximize anticaries effects."

This research project aims to develop methods and tools and conduct collaborative research for the integrative
analysis of data generated by the Developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) initiative, non-human primate
(NHP) dGTEx project, existing GTEx project, and other studies. In Aim 1, we will develop methods for mapping
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across developmental stages in multiple tissue- and cell-types.
Based on our prior work, we will employ novel multi-view learning (machine learning) methods into the proposed
general QTL framework for detecting various types of QTLs. Our framework estimates the latent probabilities of
QTL binary status (presence or absence), extracts common and specific low-rank patterns from multiple groups
and tissues/cell-types, and incorporates the patterns in estimating the posterior probability of non-zero effect and
posterior mean/standard deviation for each input statistic. These outputs can be used for further flexible
inference in detecting various types of eQTLs. The proposed QTL framework is adaptive to a variety of integrative
analyses of dGTEx, NHP, GTEx and other datasets. In Aim 2, we will develop a series of multi-age-group
Mendelian randomization (MR) models to identify risk genes and assess their causal effects in multiple
tissues/cell types and age groups. We will extend the models to multi-trait analysis jointly assessing the causal
effects in child and adult populations, to multivariable MR analysis accounting for other molecular traits, and to
multi-cell MR analysis for detecting sparse cell-level causal effects. In Aim 3, we will engage in the dGTEx
data analysis. We will work with the Steering Committee to guarantee the scientific rigor and efficiency
of dGTEx analysis, and to ensure the timely dissemination of initial findings to the broader research
community. The project will develop scalable and efficient software. The insights gained through the analysis of dGTEx
data will enhance the translational potential of genomic findings in medicine and healthcare, reshaping our approach
to understanding and treating diseases rooted in developmental gene regulation."

The goal of this study is to understand PrEP user choices, preferences, and implementation impact of the roll-
out of long-acting injectable (LAI) PrEP alongside oral PrEP among women in Malawi. As the roll-out of
expanded PrEP options increases globally, there is growing excitement that this could accelerate progress
towards ending HIV and provide discreet, user-controlled prevention options for women. Yet, real-world
choices and switches between oral and injectable PrEP products have not been evaluated on a large-scale
and high rates of product continuation are not guaranteed as has been demonstrated with oral PrEP use
globally. Thus, it is critical to understand PrEP user patterns and outcomes of PrEP implementation early
during the expansion phase of new biomedical technologies. The PathToScale is already funded – it is an
implementation science study which is rolling out injectable PrEP in Malawi to 9,900 people in real-world
conditions in January 2024, alongside further PEPFAR supported allocations for oral PrEP. The proposed
BetterInfo on PrEP study will leverage the PathToScale platform and critically extend work to evaluate use
patterns, preferences, and decision-making among women discontinuing PrEP whose choices and outcomes
will remain unknown in the absence of the proposed BetterInfo study. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate longitudinal
patterns of oral and long-acting injectable PrEP use in women in Malawi and the impact of BetterInfo tracing
approach on re-engagement in PrEP care. Specific Aim 2: Assess decision-making among injectable and oral
PrEP users and providers, as well as preferences for implementation delivery and support. In-depth interviews
with five sub-sets of PrEP user types traced (n=80) and healthcare providers/implementing partner
stakeholders (n=16) will explore decision-making and implementation and behavioral facilitators and barriers to
oral and injectable PrEP use guided by the theoretical domains framework (TDF) and COM-B model. Further,
a discrete choice experiment/best worst scaling will be conducted among the sub-sample of traced
discontinued PrEP users who remain at high risk for HIV acquisition (n=~270) to better understand preferences
around PrEP product choice, clinical support and re-engagement strategies. Specific Aim 3: Co-design
strategies for optimizing PrEP continuation and re-engagement to achieve implementation impact for
women in Malawi by combining scenario-modeling and human centered design (HCD) workshops. This
will be achieved by leveraging PathToScale and BetterInfo tracing data within mathematical models to estimate
the comparative, community-level transmission impact of oral and injectable PrEP implementation strategies
under different trajectories of PrEP use, and co-designing PrEP engagement and provider communication
strategies through HCD workshops with the community partnership council, MOH and implementing
partners/providers and clients, factoring in data across aims."

 Formation of vascular lumen of appropriate size, or tubulogenesis, is one of critical steps during
vascular development. Many vascular diseases including venous malformations (VM) are associated with
malformed or enlarged lumens. However, we still have a limited understanding of molecular events that
regulate vascular lumen size.
 Parent R01 award titled “Role of SHE and ABL signaling in vascular tubulogenesis” explores the roles of
SH2 domain protein E (SHE) and Abelson kinase (ABL) signaling during vascular tube formation in the zebrafish
model and human cell culture. It also tests the role of these pathways in VM cell culture model, and in
xenografting VM cells into a mouse. However, there is no live animal model for VM that has been previously
generated, which prevented us from testing the tole of SHE and ABL signaling in live animals. The proposed
diversity extension focuses on two proposed aims: 1) Develop zebrafish model for human venous malformation
(VM); 2) Test the role of SHE and ABL signaling in the zebrafish VM model. The proposed research for the
diversity candidate is a logical extension of the parent R01 award and will fill this gap. The research proposal will
include generation of transgenic zebrafish line, which expresses mutated Tie2 protein, previously identified in
human VMs. We will subsequently utilize the generated line to investigate the role of SHE protein and ABL
signaling in VM pathogenesis. The proposed experiments will establish live animal (zebrafish) model for human
venous malformations and will test the role of SHE and ABL signaling in this model. The proposed strategy will
help to understand the pathology of human VMs and contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies
for VMs.
 This award will also enable training of the candidate, which comes from an underrepresented
background. Training activities will include formal mentoring, an ethics in research course, participating in
research conferences, manuscript and grant application writing and others. The appointment will help to foster
diversity in science. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different
perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems."

Interactions of stem cells with their surrounding microenvironment are known to be essential for both normal
development, and for sustaining self-renewing adult stem cells, such as the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).
Since cancers often hijack developmental signals for their progression, it is likely that niche-driven signals that
sustain HSCs also influence the growth of leukemias arising from mutations in HSCs and early hematopoietic
progenitors, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (bcCML). Despite
recent advances in treatment, ~75% of AML patients still succumb to the disease, highlighting the need to better
understand mechanisms of disease progression. While much work has focused on leukemia cell-intrinsic
regulators, the role of the microenvironment in disease establishment and propagation is poorly understood. Our
overall goal is to define the role of leukemia-niche interactions on myeloid leukemogenesis. In support of a
functional role of the niche in disease progression, our work has shown that adhesive interaction of AML with
endothelial cells is critical to maintain the therapy-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Since osteoprogenitors
expand in the leukemic bone marrow, it is possible that these osteoprogenitors also create a cancer-supporting
microenvironment. As an alternate to identifying niche-driven signals promoting leukemogenesis, we determined
cell surface antigens expressed on LSCs that can act as receptors for these signals using our recent in vivo
genome-wide CRISPR screen. The 140 cell surface genes identified by our screen included those known to
promote leukemia growth (e.g., Cd47, Cd157) and novel regulators of leukemia progression. To focus on signals
likely to be cancer-specific, we selected a subset of novel cell-surface regulators with 2-fold higher expression
in human bcCML LSCs compared to normal HSCs in our new RNA-seq dataset. Of these, the taurine transporter
SLC6A6 (TauT) is of particular interest since its high expression is associated with poor prognosis in AML
(TCGA). Using TauT-/- mice, we find that genetic loss of TauT significantly impairs leukemia growth in vivo as
compared to TauT+/+. Our key preliminary data show that enzymes for synthesis of the non-essential amino acid
taurine are upregulated with osteolineage differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, and taurine is secreted in
the environment. Based on our pilot studies showing taurine synthesis by osteoprogenitors, a requirement for
LSC TauT expression for cancer growth, and expansion of osteoprogenitors in AML, we hypothesize that
osteoprogenitors sustain LSCs and support leukemia progression by secreting taurine. We will now test if TauT
expression is essential for disease progression in mouse models of disease, as well as for the propagation of
primary human leukemias. We will also determine if osteoprogenitors form a supportive microenvironment for
leukemia progression by secreting taurine. Collectively, these studies will establish the role of taurine from the
bone marrow osteolineage niche in myeloid leukemia progression. In the long term this work may lead to
development of new therapies targeting microenvironmental signals supporting cancer cells."

Project Summary/Abstract
 The overall goal of the Massachusetts Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System (PRAMS) is to collect data to improve the health of mothers in the
preconception, perinatal, or postpartum periods and the health of their infants.
Massachusetts (MA) has implemented PRAMS since 2007 and oversamples women by
race/ethnicity to allow women of color to have a greater opportunity to participate in the
survey. PRAMS methodology uses a mixed mode survey (mail and telephone) to inquire
about maternal attitudes, experiences and behaviors before, during and shortly after
pregnancy. There are approximately 70,000 births annually in MA, of which 2,400 are
sampled for inclusion in PRAMS. During the last three years for which we have weighted
data, the overall weighted response rate was 59.9%, 61.9%, and 62.4%, for 2016, 2017,
and 2018, respectively. MA PRAMS response rates have been consistently above the
CDC minimum response rate threshold of 55% during 2016-2018.
 PRAMS will be used to inform the Title V priorities and performance measures,
and support MA maternal and child health (MCH) priorities. We propose to use PRAMS
to provide reliable data to inform MCH programs with limited or nonexistent data. For
example, although MA has taken a number of steps to understand and respond to the
opioid epidemic, data on prescription pain relievers and other opioids during pregnancy,
particularly among women who have not been diagnosed or treated for substance use
disorder were lacking, as they are not captured in administrative and program data. In
addition, data on whether women received substance use disorder treatment from
providers including medication-assisted treatment (MAT) during pregnancy were limited.
We will use the PRAMS Opioid Survey and Opioid Call-Back Survey (OCBS) to obtain
these data among new mothers. In addition, the OCBS will provide a unique opportunity
to ask about access to substance misuse treatment, including MAT, rehabilitation
services, and other programs such as peer-to-peer support systems, and to identify best
practices to mitigate the risk of opioid misuse in the postpartum period and reduce
maternal opioid misuse and overdose events. Similarly, in response to the current

the inequities we see in the spread and treatment of COVID-19."
10992037,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While it is widely acknowledged that Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) have an extended
preclinical phase, there are sparse data on the cognitive and pathobiological changes in middle-ages, a critical
window for preventative intervention in people likely to progress to full-blown clinical disease. South Asians, a
population with heightened risk of AD/ADRD and vascular/metabolic risks at younger ages, offer a unique
opportunity to investigate preclinical AD/ADRD and related modifiable risk factors of its progression. Predictive
models leveraging multimodal data could transform prospects for early AD/ADRD detection and phenotype
identification in middle-aged people, but are currently lacking. To address these gaps, we propose to efficiently
leverage the NHLBI-funded PPG, the Precision-CARRS cohort (P01HL154996; n=21,864), which has ~15
years of detailed, repeated measures of socio-behavioral, environmental, and vascular/metabolic data. Our
specific aims are: (Aim-1) Perform multimodal AD/ADRD phenotyping and genetically characterize the risk of
AD/ADRD across the continuum; (Aim-2) Investigate modifiable risk factors (socio-behavioral and
vascular/metabolic factors) associated with the AD/ADRD continuum; and (Aim-3) Develop and validate a
longitudinal machine learning network by employing high-dimensional data to distinguish AD/ADRD risk. We
will achieve these aims by augmenting the cohort with AD/ADRD phenotyping and genotyping protocols
aligned with the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (P50 AG025688). This study will focus on
characterizing risks and outcomes in individuals who were enrolled in P-CARRS in two waves (2010, 2015) at
ages ≥40 years (n=8,142, 51% female, 78% literate, 38% diabetes, and 48% hypertension). We will
characterize middle-life AD/ADRD risks through newly measuring: (a) Using baseline stored samples (2010 or
2015) to perform plasma AD/ ADRD biomarkers (pTau217, NfL, and GFAP) and whole genome sequencing
and (b) At a new follow-up examination, assess plasma AD biomarkers and administer sensitive AI-driven
digital cognitive measures; and c) only in those >50 years (n=4,132), we will additionally obtain
comprehensive cognitive battery, retinal, and neuroimaging. In preliminary studies, we have successfully
demonstrated the feasibility of administering novel AI-enabled digital cognitive assessment tools, collecting and
processing plasma AD biomarkers, and pilot standardization of MRI neuroimaging biomarkers. This project will
advance progress in understanding the natural history of the AD/ADRD along the life course and promote early
detection, precise diagnosis and tailored therapeutic strategies for this high-risk, understudied population and
beyond."
10992063,"Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to increase
dramatically in the coming years. Although some people are resilient to AD pathology with normal cognition
despite tau and amyloid deposits, understanding the factors that drive such resilience will be critical for identifying
treatments for those at the highest risk of impairment. In the research proposed here, we will use cognitive
neuroscience methods to develop a systems-level understanding of the mechanisms that underlie early-stage
AD. We will examine tau deposition and functional network health in a sample of participants with normal
cognition to understand the etiology of AD and individual differences in cognitive resilience. Recent results have
shown that tau is present in different parts of the brain in different people. Thus, we hypothesize that tau deposits
in a particular brain network disrupt functional network health, and patients who appear cognitively normal
despite pathology have tau deposits in locations that have a minimal impact on functional networks.
To test this hypothesis, we will use tau positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify the spatial distribution of
tau pathology. We will also determine the role of brain network connectivity and atrophy in the health of a cohort
of diverse participants enriched for individuals at risk for AD. In Aim 1, we will use data from the publicly available
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset to test our hypotheses by determining how tau deposits
affect the health of pre-defined brain networks. We will measure functional network health based on network
segregation, neural dynamics, and cortical atrophy. In Aim 2, we will determine how segregation, dynamics,
atrophy, and tau deposits affect network flexibility. We will recruit 150 cognitively normal participants aged 55 or
older from diverse populations enriched in participants with blood markers indicating tau and, thus, at high risk
for developing AD. They will undergo tau PET and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
as part of a University of Alabama at Birmingham Alzheimer's Disease Center study and will undergo fMRI during
an auditory/visual attention task. In Aim 3, we will determine how these variables interact to affect cognitive and
sensory performance and whether they predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Successful completion of this work
will result in a better understanding of how tau deposits affect the normal patterns of brain activity and patterns
of brain atrophy. These studies will provide new information on the mechanisms through which tau results in a
system-wide decline and the conditions that lead to resilience. This knowledge may suggest treatments for
patients with AD and patient-specific training or behavior modification strategies that, applied early in the course
of AD, could mitigate its long-term effects."
10992581,"Summary:
Gene regulation is controlled by the dynamic localization of numerous regulatory factors to precise
nuclear targets. Classic diffusion and affinity models alone cannot explain various aspects of how
these processes occur, and growing observations suggest that regulation of gene expression is
not a linear process that simply reflect the number of regulators and targets in a cell. Recently,
spatial organization of regulatory molecules via formation of biomolecular condensates (BMCs)
has emerged as a likely explanation for the non-linear regulation of gene expression. However,
the functional roles of most condensates remain largely unknown because we lack methods to
simultaneously measure the many different protein and RNA regulators that bind DNA, their 3D
structural interactions in the nucleus, and gene expression within the same individual cell.
To overcome this challenge, we will develop an integrative new framework consisting of cutting
edge molecular and spatial measurements of DNA, RNA, and proteins within single cells
combined with a novel machine learning approach to identify the critical molecular components
required for organization of large, interconnected molecular interaction networks within BMCs.
We will apply these approaches to dissect a long-standing question in neuroscience – how
olfactory neurons stochastically express one, and only one, olfactory receptor gene out of the
>1000 distinct gene located throughout the genome. The transition from polygenic to monogenic
expression coincides with genomic transformations that organize the regulatory landscape of
receptor transcription into competing multi-chromosomal enhancer hubs, localization of numerous
regulatory proteins to distinct hubs, and a critical role for nascent receptor mRNA concentration
in symmetry breaking between distinct hubs.
The overall objective of this work is to develop generalized frameworks for measuring BMCs and
for understanding and predicting relationships and causal components within them, as well as a
detailed characterization of a foundational neuroscience model. We will accomplish this via the
following Specific Aims: (1) Define the spatial and molecular composition and dynamics of BMCs
within olfactory neurons, (2) Formulate a neural network model to identify critical nodes for BMC
organization and function, (3) Validate the functional role of predicted causal “nodes” in olfactory
receptor regulation. Our research team, with collective expertise in molecular mapping,
computational biology, and olfactory system research, is uniquely positioned to address these
questions."
10992582,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Extremes of bone turnover are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), a population with
exceptionally high fracture risk. Medical management of fracture risk in CKD requires assessment of bone
turnover. Bone turnover assessment is important because either high or low bone turnover can lead to low bone
mass and fracture risk, but treatment in these two bone turnover scenarios are diametrically opposite. There are
now FDA approved medications that can either decrease (e.g. bisphosphonates) or increase (e.g. teriparatide)
bone turnover, but these must be used carefully in CKD to avoid exacerbating fracture risk.
 The gold standard measurement of bone turnover in CKD requires bone biopsy and histomorphometry, which
is invasive, expensive, and not widely available. While blood biomarkers can give insights to bone turnover in
the general population, these biomarkers are cleared from the body by the kidneys, and therefore are uniformly
elevated and disassociated with bone turnover rates in CKD patients. Clinically available bone imaging
modalities quantify bone mass, but cannot determine bone turnover rates. Thus, a particularly important clinical
need is to identify novel methods to assess bone turnover rates non-invasively in CKD patients. Such innovations
would immediately impact clinical practice to prevent fractures in CKD.
 High resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) can image bone in fine detail with
low radiation dose. Cross-sectional and longitudinal HR-pQCT studies typically characterize bone density and
microstructure, but like other bone imaging modalities, do not quantify bone turnover. We propose non-invasive
‘virtual bone biopsy’ for assessment of CKD turnover metrics through the application of time-lapse HR-pQCT. In
time-lapse HR-pQCT, data obtained serially over a period of interest are processed to identify and quantify
specific areas of new bone formation and resorption, enabling the direct measurement of bone formation rate,
bone resorption rate, and total bone turnover. These measurements can be obtained for the integral volume or
within trabecular or cortical compartments.
 We aim to compare time-lapse HR-pQCT to the gold-standard, tetracycline labeled histomorphometry by
biopsy, and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of time-lapse HR-pQCT for assessment of turnover status
in a CKD population. In addition, we propose to obtain repeat HR-pQCT time-lapse data longitudinally to
determine whether time-lapse HR-pQCT can monitor changes in turnover in response to therapy. The data
generated here will be used to design follow-on clinical trials testing whether treatment guided by time-lapse HR-
pQCT can decrease fracture risk compared to usual care in CKD patients."
10992891,"Novel Role of Hepatic SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in Bile Acid Metabolism
SUMMARY
Impaired bile acid homeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver disease and liver injury as
well as many metabolic diseases including obesity and type-2 diabetes. While prior studies have identified
several critical regulators of bile acid metabolism, the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis remains
largely unclear. The Qi and Fang laboratories are leading the effort to explore the physiological roles of two
components (SEL1L and HRD1, respectively) of the same protein complex using cell type-specific knockout (KO)
mouse models. SEL1L and HRD1 proteins form a highly conserved branch of ER-associated protein degradation
(ERAD), a quality-control process responsible for the recruitment and retrotranslocation of ER proteins for
cytosolic proteasomal degradation. In the last funding cycle, they reported that hepatocyte SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD
are linked to FGF21 gene transcription via the ER-resident transcription factor CREBH. In the preliminary data
of this renew application, we have identified a novel feedback regulatory mechanism in bile acid synthesis, the
“bile acids/SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD/3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (HSD3B7)” axis, which complements
the canonical bile acid synthesis regulatory mechanism centered around the well-known “FXR-SHP-CYP7A1”
axis. HSD3B7, an ER-resident transmembrane protein, catalyzes an early step in the synthesis of bile acids from
cholesterol. Highlighting the importance of our study, over two-dozen autosomal-recessive HSD3B7 mutations
have been identified in patients with congenital bile acid synthesis defect 1 (CBAS1), who develop progressive
liver disease characterized by cholestatic jaundice and malabsorption of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins. If left
untreated, it would lead to liver failure requiring liver transplantation. In this renew application, we will test the
hypothesis that bile acids induce the expression and activity of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD, which in turn controls bile
acid biosynthesis and hence liver injury by targeting HSD3B7 protein degradation by the 26S proteasome. We
will test this hypothesis with the following three aims: (a) determine the significance of hepatic SEL1L-HRD1
ERAD in bile acid metabolism and bile acid-induced liver injury, (b) delineate mechanistically how hepatic SEL1L-
HRD1 ERAD regulates bile acid metabolism and bile acid-induced liver injury, and (c) delineate the pathological
importance and therapeutic potential of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in CBAS1 patients carrying HSD3B7 mutations.
This study will not only establish the importance of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in the liver in the regulation of bile acid
and cholesterol metabolism, but also reveals a novel regulator mechanism in the maintenance of bile acid
homeostasis.
RELEVANCE TO HUMAN HEALTH: This study will reveal novel signaling pathways and factors in bile acid
homeostasis, and provide important insights into diseases associated with this fundamental process. As SEL1L-
HRD1 ERAD is both a modulator of ER homeostasis and bile acid biosynthesis, this complex may be an ideal
target for the treatment of liver injury."

Cervical cancer incidence is increasing dramatically (2.4% per year) in Puerto Rico (PR), with increased
occurrence of regional (1.5% per year) and distant 5.0% per year) stage disease. In addition, a concurrent 2.4%
per year rise in mortality rate also occurred in PR, which reflects that the increase in incidence is real and further
indicates missed screening and/or precancer treatment opportunities. Unfortunately, 80% of cervical cancer
cases diagnosed in PR occur among low-income women covered by Medicaid or Medicare, who also have a
70% greater likelihood of being diagnosed with cervical cancer. Cervical cancer screening uptake continues to
decline in PR, particularly among low-income Medicaid enrollees, mainly seen by government clinics. Barriers
to cervical cancer screening in PR are mainly due to personal (lack of transportation, obesity-related
embarrassment) and environmental (repeated disaster events that hampered screening uptake and made a
recovery slow) factors. The absence of evidence on the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of
patient navigators has limited its adoption among government clinics in this US territory. Multicomponent
interventions that can address common screening barriers and improve screening participation in clinic-based
settings or avert the need for a clinical-based visit could help improve screening uptake and follow-up care. Our
preliminary work suggests the feasibility and acceptability of HPV self-sampling in PR. We now propose a hybrid
type 1 effectiveness-implementation study using a four-arm multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT)
conducted within government OBGYN clinics in PR. We will assess the effectiveness of patient reminders plus
patient navigation and HPV self-collection (individually and in combination) compared to patient reminders alone
in increasing cervical cancer screening, timely colposcopy, and cervical precancer treatment (Aim 1). The
secondary aim will evaluate key implementation outcomes, including patient and provider receptivity, reach, level
of implementation and fidelity, and sustainment intentions. We will then develop an open-cohort microsimulation
model to evaluate the population impact, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of alternative strategies (Aim 2)
to inform their potential applicability at delivery organization, community, and territory levels. This study will
provide much-needed knowledge that is necessary to successfully facilitate the adoption and sustained
integration of optimal strategies that will improve cervical cancer screening participation and reduce magnifying
disparities in Puerto Rico."
10988567,"Sporulation by Clostridioides difficile occurs naturally in the gut among other bacteria such as enterococci,
which are present in all animals. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to define the mechanistic basis of
bacteria-bacteria and host interactions that modulate virulence of C. difficile. The overall objective of this
proposal is to discover genetic factors involved in a potential proximity-dependent inhibition of C. difficile
sporulation by enterococci. The central hypothesis is that enterococci suppress C. difficile sporulation via
interactions at the cell surface. The rationale for this project is that determination of mechanisms of
interaction between the two species will allow the development of treatments that limit the potential for C.
difficile infection. Based on preliminary data, our overall working hypothesis for this proposal is: E. faecalis
inhibits sporulation via its surface proteins when in cell-cell contact with C. difficile. To attain the overall
objectives these two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1) Identify genes in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF
that are involved in proximity-dependent inhibition of C. difficile sporulation. In these experiments, we will
use an arrayed library of transposon insertion mutants to screen for genes in E. faecalis involved in
suppression of sporulation. Aim 2) Define the transcriptional network of enterococci-mediated sporulation
inhibition. We will develop a well calibrated transwell co-culture assay and will perform transcriptional
profiling during induction of sporulation to determine genes involved in this phenomenon. The research
proposed is innovative in the applicant’s opinion because it focuses specifically on interactions between
two gastrointestinal pathogens and how cell contact with non-kin bacteria regulates a cell fate decision.
The proposed research is significant because it will provide a context for understanding how enterococci,
which commonly expand in antibiotics-treated patients, affect the balance between spore formation and
vegetative toxin-producing C. difficile."

 In utero exposures to insults such as pregestational diabetes can have significant repercussions for
proper growth and development. Exposure to the diabetic milieu can lead to diabetic embryopathy, a disruption
in normal cellular programs during critical stages of development which leads to congenital anomalies affecting
multiple organs. Kidney anomalies resulting from genetic and in utero perturbations are the leading cause of
chronic kidney disease in children, markedly affecting quality of life. However, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of how such insults affect these early developmental programs, precluding the generation of
interventional strategies. The limitations of mouse models and differences between human and mouse kidney
programs necessitate the development of alternate systems in which to study in utero exposures. Kidney
organoids represent an attractive model for their recapitulation of developmental programs in an easily
manipulatable environment. Yet, studies with kidney organoids thus far have almost exclusively focused on
genetic diseases and injury affecting cells of the mature nephron. To this end, we will exploit iPSC-derived
kidney organoids for their ability to recapitulate human developmental processes and test how in utero
exposures to the pregestational diabetic milieu affect kidney development programs. We will focus on
programs of nephron progenitors, the precursor of all the cells in the nephron, and podocytes, a nephron
progenitor descendant critical to establishing and maintaining proper blood filtration. We will mimic the
pregestational diabetic environment in culture and interrogate the effects on nephron progenitor programs by
single cell (sc)RNA-seq and the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) as
the organoids progress through this stage of differentiation (Aim 1). We will also assess the effects on maturing
podocytes utilizing similar methodology (Aim 2). We expect to identify alterations to the normal differentiation
programs of these cells and uncover critical pathways affected by the diabetic milieu. These findings will serve
as the foundations for future studies and aid the development of novel interventional strategies then help
mitigate the effects of in utero insults. Our studies will enable new directions for kidney organoid research,
laying the groundwork for future studies into in utero insults and congenital anomalies in this ex vivo,
manipulatable system."

Inherited deficiencies of blood coagulation glycoproteins factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) result in the
bleeding disorders hemophilia A and B, respectively. These individuals require intravenous infusions of
exogenous factor to treat and prevent bleeding events. However 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A and
1-3% of patients with hemophilia B will form neutralizing antibodies called inhibitors against FVIII and FIX
respectively. Although the immune response to FVIII and FIX are both dependent on CD4+ T cell responses,
inhibitors to FIX can induce allergic IgE-mediated hypersensitivity responses and nephrotic syndrome due to
immune complex deposition, which are rarely seen in patients with FVIII inhibitors. Antigen presenting cells
(APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs), B cells, and macrophages, are essential for sensing antigens and
directing adaptive immune responses towards immunity or tolerance. DCs have an enhanced ability to capture
and process antigens for presentation on MHC complexes to naïve T cells. There is limited understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and critical cellular components that mediate innate immunity to FVIII and FIX. The
main objective of this work is to characterize the role of DCs in the innate immune response to FVIII and FIX.
This proposal consists of 3 specific aims: 1) Evaluate the role of conventional DCs in CD4+ T cell dependent-
antibody formation in murine models of hemophilia A and B, 2) Identify the mechanisms of FVIII and FIX
recognition and internalization by conventional DCs, and 3) Determine the properties of FVIII and FIX that
mediate DC activation and co-stimulatory signaling. In Aim 1, T cell responses and antibody formation will be
measured after targeted depletion of APC subsets in mice immunized with FVIII, FIX, or ovalbumin. The role of
phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis through C-type lectin receptors DCIR2
and Dectin-2 in FVIII and FIX uptake under normal conditions and with inflammation will be evaluated to
determine the mechanism of factor recognition and internalization by DCs in Aim 2. In Aim 3, the effect of
increasing concentrations of FVIII and FIX on DC activation in vitro will be measured. Additionally, the effect of
inhibiting DC co-stimulatory signals on T cell activation, antibody responses, and complement activation in
hemophilia A and B mice immunized by intravenous, subcutaneous, or intraperitoneal injections of FVIII and
FIX will be evaluated. A fundamental understanding of these mechanisms will be important for evaluating
immunologic changes in hemophilia patients during early factor exposure and for the development of strategies
that prevent and eradicate inhibitors. The career development plan outlined will address training in
immunology, molecular biology laboratory techniques, and translational research to ensure successful
transition to research independence."
10989086,"Summary/Abstract
Malaria control and elimination face significant challenges due to drug resistance, particularly to
the current front-line artemisinin-based combination therapy in the Greater Mekong Region, to
artemisinin (ART) derivatives in Myanmar and now disturbingly in eastern Africa where most
serious falciparum malaria cases are concentrated. To ensure the continued effectiveness of ART
and its partner drugs, early detection and characterization of resistance, robust surveillance and
subsequent isolation are required. World-wide clinical and molecular surveillance of artemisinin
resistance (ART-R) relies on southeast Asian characteristics of longer parasite clearance times
from patients and genotyping for mutations in the most common ART resistant gene, k13 (a gene
on chromosome 13 coding for a kelch domain protein, K13). The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHTs) in
Bangladesh borders Myanmar, and is a forested, hilly and remote region that is endemic to 90%
of the country’s malaria. Recent clinical clearance and in vitro assays not only in the CHTs but also
in Africa demonstrate that although combination treatment remains efficacious in infected
patients, a cohort of the field isolates display in vitro low-moderate ART-R with no K13 mutations.
This suggests that clones with partial ART-R exist and are going undetected by patient parasite
clearance studies and molecular surveillance. Proactive analysis of the impact of these molecular
determinants will be critical to characterize resistance before the problem is widespread in these
regions in the pre-elimination era. We hypothesize that 1) Clinical ART resistant mutations can
be predicted from in vitro generated mutants in isolates from the same spatiotemporal space. 2)
ART sensitivity is changing in the CHTs with continued use of artemisinin combination therapy
since 2004. The initial low-moderate ART-R mediated by causal K13 independent mutations will
be an optimal platform for highly resistant and highly fit K13 mutations to arise and spread. We
will test our hypotheses with two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will perform whole-genome
sequencing of in vitro evolved K13 independent ART-R in recent CHT isolates; in parallel
determine the drug sensitivities and genomic sequences of parasites recently isolated from CHT
patients and functionally validate top candidate genes by CRISPR-Cas9 editing. In Aim 2, we will
perform preemptive resistance and fitness cost analysis of major K13 mutations in the K13
independent ART resistant and ART sensitive CHT genetic backgrounds, to determine if these
“unknown factors” assist the resistance potential and sustainability of these K13 mutations.
Together, this study will provide a comprehensive view of the complex emerging ART-R with a
broader applicability to similar scenarios in Eastern Africa."

Lineage plasticity is a prominent feature of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which
accompanies several stages of this disease ranging from tumor initiation, chemotherapy resistance, and the
acquisition of metastatic traits. Our work in this area has relied heavily on the application of epigenomics and
high throughput genetic screening in clinically relevant PDAC models. An important attribute of our work is to
take deep-dives into causal molecular mechanisms, which naturally focuses on the lineage master regulator
proteins that implement aberrant cell fate transitions. Our work seeks to challenge the view that transcription
factors are undruggable by defining the molecular details of their cancer maintenance functions. Into the next
funding cycle of this grant, our focus will continue to be on the basal (also known as adenosquamous) cell state,
which is known to emerge aberrantly during PDAC progression. In our published work, we have defined
mechanisms by which Np63 and ZBED2, two transcription factors that are expressed in the normal basal
lineage but not in the normal human pancreas, drive basal identity in PDAC. The next funding cycle of this grant
will pursue key unanswered questions related to these factors in PDAC biology. The first Aim will focus on
MED12, a novel master regulator of basal identity in PDAC and transcriptional coactivator of Np63, which we
identified by way of an unbiased genetic screen. We will perform CRISPR base-editor tiling screens coupled with
molecular reporters to map MED12 mutations that disrupt Np63 function without altering other MED12
transcriptional functions. We will biochemically and epigenomically characterize these novel MED12 alleles to
gain an atomic level understanding of its involvement in sustaining basal identity in PDAC. The second aim builds
upon our prior work showing that a basal identity in PDAC reprograms the stroma via a unique secretory
phenotype driven by Np63. We will establish novel in vivo basal-like PDAC models with inducible Np63 and
MED12 knockdown to compare how each factor drives a secretory phenotype that reprograms the tumor stroma.
The third aim focuses on ZBED2, which was unstudied prior to our recent publication, but we have shown that
this factor can destabilize the classical-ductal identity in PDAC by antagonizing IRF1 function, which in turn leads
to repression of the GATA6 gene. Since much of our prior work on ZBED2 occurred in tissue culture systems,
the logical extension of this work will be to manipulate ZBED2, IRF1, and GATA6 in organoid models of PDAC
in vivo, a system that fosters the lineage plasticity potential seen in human PDAC. We seek to test the hypothesis
that acquisition of ZBED2 expression can ‘kickstart’ ductal-to-basal trans-differentiation by interfering with the
IRF1-GATA6 axis. Collectively, this research will reveal several fundamental biological characteristics of basal
identity in PDAC, which may have broader implications in other carcinomas that exhibit this aberrant cell fate
transition."
10985344,"Abstract: We previously confirmed that loss of the X-linked gene NEXMIF results in social behavior deficits and intellectual disability. Although only male NEXMIF patients were initially diagnosed, 72% of recent clinical cases are female individuals of NEXMIF haploinsufficiency demonstrating similar neurological features. To further study the role of NEXMIF, we generated a Nexmif knockout (KO) mouse model which displays neuronal deficits, impaired learning and memory, repetitive behaviors, and social and communication defects. In line with female cases, heterozygous (HET) female mice show behavioral impairments similar to the KO male mice. HET mouse brains contain a mosaic of neurons of both NEXMIF-expressing wild-type (WT) and NEXMIF-lacking (KO) neurons. Due to the process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI), null cells in HET mice retain a silenced copy of WT Nexmif on the inactive X. Inhibition of XCI-promoting factors (XCIFs) has been shown effective in reactivating X-linked target genes, such as Mecp2. However, the experimental approaches and the biological effect of X chromosome reactivation (XCR) in the context of Nexmif-associated deficits have yet to be investigated. We aim to explore the feasibility of Nexmif gene reactivation via XCIF inhibition induced by small molecules including shRNAs and chemical compounds, and also establish a CRISPR-based strategy to specifically reactivate the Nexmif gene. We will then determine the rescue effects following Nexmif gene dosage restoration on neuronal morphology and behavioral deficits in HET female mice."
10985050,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects over 6 million Americans, and its incidence is projected
to double by 2050 due to an aging population. In the fight against AD, there is a pressing need for novel
biomarkers to 1) identify clinical trial participants at risk of decline and 2) identify and track patients eligible for
emerging treatments. Gold standard AD biomarkers require positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or
cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collected via lumbar puncture. These procedures are expensive and/or invasive,
presenting a barrier to widespread adoption. Blood-based biomarkers are under development but are not yet
validated and may benefit from combination with other biomarkers. A principal goal of the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 3 is to promote development of novel AD biomarkers, including the use of
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). FMRI is used to study the functional connectivity (FC) and
organization of the brain, and fMRI studies have revealed functional brain changes associated with AD. FMRI-
based biomarkers of AD could complement existing biomarkers by providing a non-invasive, first-line screening
method before PET and CSF are collected. FMRI could also be combined with blood biomarkers and established
structural MRI markers—all of which can be routinely collected clinically—to construct powerful and widely
available multimodal biomarkers. Despite all of this, no fMRI-based biomarker for AD exists to date. This is in
part due to the high noise levels of fMRI and the common use of naive statistical methods, which together lead
to noisy estimates of FC and other functional brain features. Two conventional workarounds—averaging many
subjects or collecting hours of data on individual subjects—are not viable clinically. This project will address this
gap by developing computationally efficient Bayesian techniques with high accuracy and deploying those
methods for fMRI-based biomarker discovery in AD. Our models leverage information across subjects via
population-derived priors or “templates”, which are previously estimated, to extract nuanced and precise
functional brain features in individuals. These models avoid the need for burdensome prolonged scans. They
can be fit to data from a single subject at a time, making them clinically viable and computationally advantageous.
To maximize the benefits of hierarchical modeling, we utilize grayordinates data, a recent technological advance
in image processing that improves inter-subject anatomical alignment. To deploy these techniques effectively in
multi-site datasets like the ADNI, image harmonization is necessary to avoid confounding site effects. Existing
harmonization methods can be applied to fMRI summary measures, but are not applicable to fMRI time series,
which are a complex mixture of latent features. To address this critical gap, we will develop a novel harmonization
method for fMRI time series data, with high potential impact on fMRI processing pipelines. Finally, we will analyze
fMRI data from ADNI to extract functional brain features and build novel fMRI-based AD biomarkers. While our
focus is AD, this project will have broad implications for fMRI-based research and care."

suggesting the GI tract as the origin of α-syn pathology and its subsequent spread to the brain, is a
focal point of discussion. This cascade is implicated in neuroinflammation and cognitive decline,
particularly in ADRD cases featuring α-syn pathology. Utilizing the established Gut-Brain α-
synucleinopathy (GBAS) model, we aim to investigate the progression of these pathologies from the
gut to the brain, emphasizing the gut-brain axis's role in ADRD. Additionally, we shed light on the often-
overlooked area of adaptive immunity, specifically T cell-mediated responses, noted for their diverse
functions and immune potency, which may play a role in governing α-syn pathology, based on recent
research findings. Looking ahead, we explore the emerging potential of T-cell immunity in α-synuclein
propagation within α-synucleinopathies. An interdisciplinary research team is poised to examine the
impact of T-cell responses on α-syn pathology progression and explore potential applications of

High visual acuity, binocular alignment and binocular coordination of eye movements are important in foveate

In Aim 1, we investigate how strabismic subjects orient their eyes to visual targets within their environment. We
will build upon our recent work, recording from the superior colliculus in non-human primate models for
strabismus, that has focused on a curious gaze orienting behavior, wherein under binocular viewing, many
strabismic subjects choose their eye of fixation depending upon location of the eccentric visual target. In the
proposed experiments, we will investigate the contribution of a critical area for visual target selection, the
Frontal Eye Fields and use a unique stimulus (the double-step paradigm) to test the validity of a competition
framework as the basis for gaze orienting behavior in alternating strabismus. In Aim 2, we will test, in the
monkey, an innovative new therapeutic approach to treat MD amblyopia that has demonstrated remarkable
recovery of vision in the MD eye, involving temporarily inactivating the fellow eye by intravitreal injection of a
low volume of low concentration tetrodotoxin (TTX). If TTX therapy were shown to be an effective and safe
substitute for patching therapy, it would foster a revolutionary advance in treatment of amblyopia. Following
induction of amblyopia via MD in infant NHP, TTX will be injected into the vitreous cavity of the good eye.
Rigorous vision testing will be performed after MD to establish the severity of amblyopia and repeated after
TTX treatment to test treatment efficacy. Within this specific aim, we will also determine whether TTX
microinjection is safe and has no permanent effects on eye function or structure. Our approach to investigating
parameter space will include experiments in animals at two ages (within and outside the critical period), at two
dosage levels and with two frequencies of application. Control experiments will include sham injections and a
reverse occlusion cohort. Before and after each round of TTX injection, visual function testing will be
conducted, including visual acuity evaluation via VEP or CSF testing, testing of stereo function, evaluation of
the pupil, refraction, ERG, bio-microscopy, biometry, and OCT retinal nerve fiber layer/optic nerve imaging.
Finally histologic evaluation of the eyes will evaluate any evidence of TTX-induced damage and histological
evaluation of brain will evaluate support for amblyopia recovery. Thus, each of the two aims leverage our
unique expertise in working with monkey models for visual development disorders and is likely to significantly
advance understanding of mechanisms underlying neural circuitry. Moreover, this project has the potential to
help guide the development of rationally based therapies for amblyopia."
10990745,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The multicenter PRECISE Analgesia (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Analgesia
for Cardiac and Idiopathic Scoliosis Spine Fusion Elective Surgery in Children) trials will a) implement and in-
vestigate the efficacy and safety of multidose methadone-based standardized enhanced recovery after surgery
(ERAS) protocol, and b) develop personalized ERAS protocols including precision methadone and oxycodone
dosing and personalized analgesia for the safe and effective opioid-sparing management of surgical pain after
posterior spine fusion (PSF) and cardiac surgery (CS) in children. PSF and CS are both extremely painful sur-
geries in children requiring long hospital stays and high opioid use associated with adverse effects (AEs), high
incidence of opioid dependence (OD), and chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP). Post-discharge prescribed oxyco-
done is used for >1-2 weeks, and opioid dependence occurs within 5 days in children. 20-50% of children develop
CPSP, largely due to severe uncontrolled acute surgical pain, contributing to life-long risks for opioid use/misuse
and the ongoing opioid epidemic. There is an urgent need for safe, effective opioid-sparing analgesia as well as
proactive risk predictions and personalized analgesia to provide best-in-class immediate surgical pain relief while
minimizing the risk of opioid-induced respiratory depression (RD), sedation, postoperative nausea and vomiting
(PONV), CPSP and persistent opioid use/misuse. Recently, we showed that a methadone- based standardized
ERAS protocol shortened hospital stays (2-4 days), reduced prescribed opioid use (5-7 vs. 7-18 days), and the
risks of CPSP. Despite this improvement, with standardized methadone ERAS, 30-40% of children still experi-
enced uncontrolled severe pain, PONV, and sedation from methadone and oxycodone. Our preliminary data
show that CYP2B6 and ORM1 genotypes and alpha acid glycoprotein (AAG) contribute to the variation in phar-
macokinetics (PK), analgesia, and adverse outcomes. Our preliminary data in children undergoing CS with car-
dio-pulmonary bypass (CPB) reveal opioid-sparing and safe postoperative analgesia with methadone. We will
now study the effect of CPB on intraoperative methadone dosing with robust PK modeling to enable precision
methadone dosing for the first time in children. Our expert multidisciplinary team will enroll a total of 1000
children to conduct two parallel randomized clinical trials for PSF (500 children 12-<18 yrs from 4 clinical sites)
and CS (500 children 1 month-10 yrs from 5 clinical sites). Specifically, we will 1. Conduct two randomized clinical
trials in PSF and CS to compare acute pain relief, opioid-sparing efficacy, and safety of standardized periopera-
tive multidose methadone-based ERAS vs. standard-of-care non-methadone-based analgesia. 2. Develop pre-
cision methadone dosing based on age, CYP2B6 and ORM1 variants, AAG, and CPB, and 3. Identify patient
profiles that predict benefit from the assigned analgesia protocol to optimize clinical outcomes. Overall Impact:
Implementation of evidence-based standardized methadone-based ERAS pain management and individualized
risk prediction will maximize acute surgical pain relief while minimizing opioid use and AEs in millions of children."
10990746,"Abstract
 Our health and wellbeing prenatally and during the earlier years of life affect all future health and disease
risks. This time period is the most sensitive for a child’s developing brain and various other tissues of body.
Studies of developmental biology have demonstrated that gene expression patterns are not only tissue-specific
and cell type-specific, but also age regulated and controlled through coordinated action of complex tissue- and
cell-type specific networks and pathways. The NIH Developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (dGTEx) project
aims to study gene expression patterns at a tissue-level over several early developmental windows and to char-
acterize transcriptional profiles during human development. Complementary to the human dGTEx effort, the
non-human primate (NHP) dGTEx aims to study gene expression patterns in multiple reference tissues across
developmental stages in NHP model species and compare them to human gene expression patterns. The over-
arching goal of Penn Data Integration and Statistical Analysis Methods (Penn-DISAM) project is to develop novel
statistical and computational methods specifically for effective analysis of human dGTEx and NHP dGTEx data,
including novel methods for analyzing a very large set of correlated regression functions that characterize the
age-dependent gene expression functions across different tissues and between human and primates. The dG-
TEx and NHP dGTEx data allow us to estimate the tissue-cell specific age-dependent gene expression functions
by leveraging the gene expression data measured over different ages in postnatal, early childhood, pre-pubertal
and post-pubertal developmental windows. We will particularly develop nonparametric B-spline regression to
estimate the age-dependent gene expression regression functions and summarize the data as the matrix of
functions. We will develop methods for data visualization and for statistical inference, including methods for iden-
tifying genetic variants that are associated with different gene expression distribution functions in each of the
tissues. We will also develop novel statistical warping methods to align gene expression trajectories between
human and primates, which allow us to identify genes under strong stabilizing selection, to quantify the inter-
species divergence in gene expression in each tissue and in each developmental stage, and to compare the
difference of age-dependent weighted co-expression networks between human and primates. Penn-DISAM will
work closely with the dGTEx consortium to develop, implement, test and apply these methods and the software
tools to dGTEx data. Finally, we will make all the software available via AnVIL and GitHub."
10976322,"SUMMARY
Model organisms are essential experimental systems for investigating and defining protein and genetic
networks, discovering new gene functions, and uncovering the functional consequences of human genome
variation. The Alliance of Genome Resources (aka, the Alliance) is a consortium of seven model organism
databases (MODs; Drosophila, C. elegans, budding yeast, zebrafish, laboratory mouse, laboratory rat,
Xenopus) and the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) with a shared mission of facilitating use of biological
insights from model organisms to understand the genetic and genomic basis of human health and disease.
The Alliance seeks to serve a diverse community of biomedical researchers including basic scientists,
clinicians, and data scientists. The Alliance is organized as two interdependent units: Alliance Central and
Alliance Knowledge Centers. Alliance Central serves as a software platform developed using modular
infrastructure and common data models to and for the coordination of data harmonization and data modeling
activities across the Knowledge Centers. Alliance Knowledge Centers including MODs and the GOC are
responsible for expert curation and for submission of annotations to Alliance Central using community
standards for knowledge representation. Alliance Central represents a next generation extensible software
platform for knowledgebases capable of adapting to the rapidly changing data landscape and conforming to
modern standards for data management. Alliance Central provides the biomedical research community with
unprecedented support for comparative genomics via unified user interfaces and APIs for common data types
and promotes sustainability and operational efficiencies of core biodata resources. This U24 application
describes the plans for the enhancement and management of Alliance Central building on the significant
accomplishments of the Alliance consortium since it was launched in 2016. The focus for Specific Aim 1 will
be on expanding the Alliance Central infrastructure for ingesting, storing, and accessing the harmonizing
biological annotations from contributing Knowledge Centers. We will continue software development practices
that reflect our long-standing commitment to data management practices that align with FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles. In Specific Aim 2 we describe our plans to continue
development of a state of the art literature curation system that can be adapted for use by a wide range of
biomedical model organism databases. The deliverables for this aim will include the incorporation of machine
learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence designed to enhance scalability and efficiency
of expert curation. In Specific Aim 3 we describe our plans for implementation and/or adoption of user
interfaces that advance the mission of the Alliance to facilitate comparative genomics to gain insights into the
function of the human genome. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we describe the management and organization of
the Alliance as well as extensive activities for user support and community engagement."
10979049,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Everyday experience requires humans to make plans in a hierarchical fashion, so they can anticipate visual
events that might occur seconds, minutes, hours, or longer in the future. For example, when walking through a
city, individuals must track their immediate surroundings (e.g., the movement of pedestrians around them),
intermediate sub-goals (e.g., landmarks along their route), and long-timescale goals (e.g., their final destination).
Despite the ubiquity of such hierarchical anticipation in behavior, it is unclear how the brain can simultaneously
anticipate events at multiple timescales. Our aim is to uncover the mechanisms underlying hierarchical
anticipatory signals in the brain’s visual system, by determining how these signals form, what they represent,
how they are updated, and how they guide future-oriented behavior. This will be accomplished with functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuropsychological studies, naturalistic stimuli, computational models, and
sophisticated analytic approaches for characterizing the dynamics of brain activity. These methods will determine
the conditions under which the visual system generates hierarchical anticipatory signals, the content and
flexibility of those signals, how they arise, and their consequences for behavior. Aim 1 will establish how
hierarchical anticipatory signals form and what they represent. We hypothesize that such hierarchical anticipation
depends on input from memory systems, is informed by pre-existing schema, and is flexible in the visual features
and timescales represented. Aim 2 will determine how hierarchical anticipatory signals may be affected by top-
down goals to simulate the future, and how these signals relate to future-oriented visual behavior at a range of
timescales. We hypothesize that the visual hierarchy differentially updates its anticipatory signals when the
environment or goals change, and generates predictive signals in novel situations by linking separate episodic
memories. Finally, Aim 3 will test competing theories of the structure of anticipatory representations. We
hypothesize that anticipatory representations are influenced by both temporal and semantic relationships within
an event sequence, and propose a computational model for predicting anticipatory event representations learned
from a temporally-structured stimulus. Together, the findings will elucidate the mechanisms by which the visual
system forms and flexibly updates anticipatory representations at multiple timescales, and how these
representations relate to anticipatory behavior in naturalistic conditions. Such insights are important because
expectations are instrumental in allowing individuals to behave adaptively, and disruption of visual anticipation
might broadly impair goal-directed behavior. This work will therefore shed light on how the capacity to anticipate
upcoming events to adaptively guide behavior might be impaired following damage to different parts of the visual
system, including higher-order areas whose damage is not associated with primary visual deficits. Together, the
results will provide empirical tests of the structure and development of anticipatory signals across the visual
hierarchy, informing theories that consider the brain to be a fundamentally predictive organ."
10976045,"Depression affects up to 34% of care partners (CP) of people living with Alzheimer’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (PLWD) each year and despite the expansion of treatments, most individuals do not receive treatment. Three key barriers to treatment exist: low detection, low mental health literacy (MHL) and limited treatment accessibility, exacerbated in rural settings. Innovative informatics solutions to barriers exist including automating screening, enhancing MHL through decision aids (DA) and increasing accessibility via location-independent, online treatments. Yet there is a gap in identifying strategies to screen and connect CP of PLWD with unmet mental health needs to treatments. The objective for this GEMSSTAR is to modify an innovative application, iPATH*D, developed previously by the research team, for CP of PLWD. iPath*D is an online platform that connects patients screening positive for clinically significant depression in rural cancer settings to a range of online and in-person evidence-based treatments. Investigators plan to adapt both the content and implementation of iPath*D, then establish its acceptability, usability, and feasibility, overcoming the unique challenges to help-seeking CP of PLWD. The specific aims are: Aim 1. Optimize and assess feasibility and acceptability of a pathway to identify care partners of persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia at risk for depression; and Aim 2. Determine feasibility, acceptability, and usability of implementing iPath*D with care partners of persons living with Alzheimer’s disease/Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia and its preliminary impact on MHL, screening and treatment rates. The study tests the hypotheses that: (1) iPath*D will be acceptable and highly usable and will demonstrate preliminary impact of increased MHL, screening rates and treatment access. The development of iPath*D follows a user centered design model. In Aim 1, using participatory design activities to inform needed adaptations of iPath*D, 15 care partners will co-design iPath*D and inform the development of low and high-fidelity iPath*D prototypes. These prototypes will go through rounds of iterative development, with extensive usability evaluations, ensuring iPath*D surpasses usability metrics. In Aim 2, an open label, single arm pilot, 15 care partners screening positive for depression will receive iPath*D. We will assess real world usability, acceptability and feasibility, collect preliminary data on MHL, and gather rates of screening and treatment access, treatment initiation, adherence, change in caregiver burden, and depression symptom improvement. This research is innovative in developing and testing a novel services delivery model (iPath*D) that addresses existing barriers to care. The results are expected to have a major positive impact by providing proof-of-principle for the use of an online pathway to treatment with the potential for reaching an unprecedented number of individuals in rural settings with unmet mental health needs by understanding and implementing the optimal design of an innovative model of services delivery for CP of PLWD who experience depression."
10976050,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic pain is a common symptom that affects 30-40% of cancer survivors, diminishing their quality of life,
impairing physical functions, and increasing health care costs. Breast cancer survivors constitute the largest
group of survivors with more than 4.1 million in the US. Nearly one in two breast cancer survivors who take a
class of medication known as aromatase inhibitors are affected by a chronic painful condition, aromatase
inhibitor-associated arthralgia (AIA). AIA is associated with reduced physical activity, increased risk of falls, and
reduced AI adherence, leading to increased overall mortality. With insufficient relief from conventional
treatments and a rapidly growing population of breast cancer survivors, there is an urgent need to develop
novel, effective, and scalable pain management options. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement
(MORE) is an innovative mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) rooted in affective neuroscience that integrates
training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills to specifically target chronic pain and related symptoms
(e.g. psychological distress). Although the efficacy of MORE for pain in non-cancer populations has been
established, the potential for this mindfulness intervention to address pain and comorbid symptoms in breast
cancer survivors has yet to be confirmed. Therefore, a rigorous, adequately-powered randomized controlled
trial is needed to conclusively determine whether MBIs such as MORE can alleviate AIA. To address this
critical gap in research and clinical care, we have convened a multidisciplinary team to conduct the Enhanced
Pain Coping in Cancer (EPIC) trial with the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the specific efficacy of MORE
for managing AIA among breast cancer survivors, 2) to evaluate the specific effects of MORE on comorbid
symptoms, quality of life, and adherence to AIs, and 3) to elucidate the cognitive-affective mechanisms of
MORE for pain management among breast cancer survivors. The MORE intervention that we will test aligns
with a downward spiral of chronic pain model and neuroscience and is based on discoveries from preliminary
studies. For this multisite, randomized controlled trial we will randomize 200 breast cancer survivors free of
oncologic disease with AIA to one of two eight-week treatments: 1) MORE or 2) supportive group
psychotherapy (SG). We will assess the primary outcome (pain-related functional interference) and secondary
outcomes at baseline, week 8 (end of treatment), week 12 and week 24 (primary end point) using validated
patient-reported outcomes. EPIC will address major methodological limitations of existing MBI trials including
pain not being a primary outcome, no eligibility requirement for having pain, and the MBIs under investigation
having been developed to target stress management rather than pain management. EPIC will provide timely
clinical evidence for MORE, a neuroscience-informed, mindfulness-based intervention for pain and co-morbid
symptoms, during cancer survivorship. Further, virtual delivery will ensure MORE is highly scalable with broad
reach to improve pain management for millions of breast cancer survivors across the US."
10990700,"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa and Zimbabwe are disproportionately affected by
HIV. Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), bimonthly injectable PrEP, and the monthly PrEP ring are
promising biomedical strategies to reduce HIV incidence, but low adherence and continuation on these
methods among AGYW threatens their public health impact. The evidence-informed Comprehensive
Adherence Resource and Empowerment Support (CARES) intervention aims to support PrEP adherence and
continuation among AGYW through counseling, adherence biomarker feedback, and choice from a menu of
additional strategies, including support clubs, phone calls, and SMS. In a preliminary study (MTN-034) in South
Africa, Zimbabwe, and Uganda, AGYW received CARES and achieved protective adherence levels for ring
and oral PrEP at 57% of visits, versus 14%–32% in comparable studies. However, CARES was designed for a
highly resourced clinical trial; there is need to establish whether it can be implemented with fidelity, feasibility,
and acceptability in real-world programs. The goals of the proposed study, led by multiple principal
investigators from RTI International, the Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation, and the Pangaea Zimbabwe AIDS
Trust, are to adapt CARES to be implementable, incorporating injectable PrEP, and to evaluate effectiveness
and implementation of the adapted intervention in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In Aim 1, we will adapt CARES
by conducting formative research (literature review; 24 key informant interviews with PrEP providers, program
leaders, policy makers and funders; and six focus groups with AGYW PrEP users) and then applying the
findings in collaborative adaptation workshops with youth experts to streamline CARES while retaining core
components. The adapted materials will be pretested before finalization. In Aim 2, we will test the effectiveness
of CARES to increase PrEP continuation and adherence among AGYW at four PrEP delivery sites. We will
employ a rigorous interrupted time series (ITS) design with monthly pre- and post-implementation assessments
over 24 months. The primary outcome will be the proportion of AGYW continuing on any PrEP product for
3 months after initiation, per clinical records. The secondary outcome is the proportion with high PrEP
adherence, assessed by clinic records or biomarkers among a subsample of 100 AGYW per month. In Aim 3,
we will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of CARES in the same ITS study using a parallel
convergent mixed-methods design. Data will include quantitative surveys (N = 1,500) and in-depth interviews
(N = 32) with AGYW; semistructured interviews with 12 CARES providers, 8 PrEP providers, and 8 clinic or
program leaders; and records of program implementation and cost. If effective, CARES could significantly
increase PrEP adherence and continuation among AGYW in real-world PrEP delivery settings, reducing HIV
incidence. By addressing feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity at this stage of development, we will ensure that
CARES is ideally positioned for scale-up to programs throughout the region."

 The goal of this proposal is to complete the remaining pre-clinical proof of concept and safety
studies required to file a pre-IND application with the FDA for a first-in-class bicistronic AAV gene
therapy for patients with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type R9 (LGMDR9). Gene therapy has
recently shown great promise in treating some forms of muscular dystrophy as a gene
replacement technology, wherein a normal functional version of the gene mutated in the disease
is introduced back into the muscles of the patient. Such gene replacement technologies are
designed to prevent further development of disease symptoms, but this strategy will do little to
reverse disease in patients where loss of muscle mass and strength is already present. To
accomplish disease reversal for muscular dystrophy patients, a bicistronic, or two gene, therapy
is needed wherein disease prevention is accomplished through gene replacement while a second
gene function is provided to rebuild muscle size and strength. We have developed such a
bicistronic Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) gene therapy for this purpose. Such bicistronic vectors
will be compared to monocistronic (one gene) vectors to demonstrate their superiority in reversing
disease symptoms in a model of LGMDR9 (formerly called LGMD2i). Experiments will be done
to understand the optimal formulation needed for an effective bicistronic gene therapy for
LGMDR9 and also determine the safety of such a treatment. If successful, these experiments
would provide a platform to design new improved therapies almost two dozen other forms of
LGMD and Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (CMD)."
10992317,"The therapeutic landscape for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) has advanced dramatically in the past 5 years,
but conflicting observations about the metabolism of expanded CUG mRNA (transcription, export, turnover, and
translation) present challenges for how to interpret results from clinical trials and direct future therapeutic
strategies. Fully understanding these fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms in DM1 has been severely
limited due to lack of an animal model containing repeat lengths reflective of human disease states and expressed
with appropriate spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this problem, we have developed a new mouse model of
DM1 (Dmpk CTGexp), which expresses >1700 CTG repeats within native mouse Dmpk. Heterozygous mice display
disease features including nuclear foci, splicing defects, myotonia, and myopathy. Further, the expanded allele
in this model is tagged with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for tracking mRNA accumulation,
knockdown, and transport. By using this model, we will determine strengths and weaknesses of leading
therapeutic strategies, helping to focus clinical efforts on those with greatest potential. Three therapeutic
platforms – antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), siRNAs, and phosphoramidite morpholino oligonucleotides
(PMOs) – are in or are rapidly advancing toward early phase trials in DM1. Based on observations that mutant
DMPK RNA sequesters MBNL proteins to form nuclear foci, causing extensive changes in the muscle
transcriptome, these agents either degrade DMPK transcripts or release MBNL protein from nuclear foci by tiling
the CUG repeat tract. While initial results are encouraging, there is vigorous debate surrounding the strengths
and weaknesses of each strategy. In Aim 1, we will first clarify mechanisms regulating the life cycle of expanded
Dmpk mRNA. We will study the effects of expanded CUG repeats on transcription, turnover, subcellular
localization, and translation of host Dmpk mRNA. In Aim 2, we will compare three major therapeutic strategies:
ASOs, siRNA, and PMOs. We will elucidate mechanisms, strengths, and limitations of each using validated
skeletal muscle readouts. In Aim 3, we will evaluate multi-systemic treatments by testing a PMO conjugate and
MyoAAV-miRNA, to test the hypothesis that such approaches can rescue splicing defects in skeletal, cardiac
and/or smooth muscle."
10981337,"Over 100,000 patients with alcohol use disorder develop sepsis annually in the United States. Patients with
alcohol use disorder who develop sepsis are significantly more likely to die or have a complicated intensive
care unit stay than septic patients without a history of alcohol use disorder. This proposal aims to understand
why alcohol use disorder worsens outcomes in sepsis, as understanding this could lead to precision medicine
approaches in this patient population. Using a model of chronic alcohol ingestion that does not result in
detectable end organ damage followed by sepsis, we are able to identify possible mechanisms for why
mortality is worse in alcohol/sepsis. While the majority of organs have similar function and histology between
alcohol/septic and water/septic mice, both gut integrity and the adaptive immune system are severely
dysregulated in alcohol/septic mice. Intestinal permeability is mediated through three different pathways that
allow selective movement of gut luminal contents into the host. Each of these pathways is worsened in
alcohol/sepsis, leading to gut hyperpermeability. The pore and leak pathways are mediated via the apical tight
junction, allowing molecules of different sizes to pass through, although notably intact bacteria are too large to
pass through either pathway. Increased gut permeability leads to altered host inflammation. CD103 is a key
component in orchestrating immune responses in mucosal tissues, ensuring the body's defense against
infections while preventing unwarranted immune reactions that could harm host tissues. Additionally, under
normal conditions, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are essential for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing
excessive inflammation. However, during sepsis, the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
responses becomes disrupted and impaired function of regulatory T cells allows for uncontrolled activation of
effector T cells and other immune cells, thus contributing to the sepsis-induced cytokine storm and organ
damage. Notably, CD103 is downregulated on CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells in alcohol/sepsis while regulatory
T cells are increased within the CD4+ T cell compartment in alcohol/sepsis. This proposal seeks to understand
the mechanisms underlying specific differences in alcohol/septic mice compared to water/septic mice with the
ultimate goal of improving outcomes in septic patients with alcohol use disorder prior to hospital admission."
10981899,"Project Summary / Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the basic cellular, molecular, and physiological mechanisms of
cold nociception. Thermosensory nociception is a specialized form of somatosensation, essential to the survival
of all metazoans, that alerts the organism to potential environmental dangers coupled with pain sensation thereby
serving as a protective mechanism for driving adaptive behavioral responses to safeguard against incipient
damage. Despite this importance, the fundamental cellular, molecular, and physiological bases of cold
nociception remain incompletely understood. Molecularly, transient receptor potential channels (i.e.
thermoTRPs) play critical roles in thermosensation either by direct or indirect activation in response to
temperature change, however, the mechanisms by which cold temperatures are transformed into ion channel
structural alterations to regulate neural activity remain unclear. Similarly, relatively less is known regarding how
thermoTRPs may interact with other sensory transduction receptors and downstream signaling pathways to
mechanistically regulate cold detection. Neurologically, acute and chronic pain may manifest as altered
thermosensory nociception whereby thermal stimuli erroneously engage nociceptive circuitry leading to
neuropathic pain. Cold allodynia or hyperalgesia are well-known symptoms of inflammatory and neuropathic
pain that have been associated with peripheral nerve injury, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, stroke, and
chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, however, the mechanisms underlying cold sensitization are poorly
understood. Here, we will investigate how noxious cold stimulation exerts cellular and physiological effects on
membrane properties, cytoskeletal dynamics, and mechanosensory ion channel function. Further, we will
characterize non-canonical roles of sensory transduction receptor signaling in regulating cold nociception. Using
Drosophila as a model system, we will bi-directionally link experimental and computational approaches involving
neurogenetics, high-resolution cellular imaging, in vivo functional imaging, electrophysiology, behavioral assays,
and computational biophysically-grounded modeling. The project aims and outcomes of this research will
significantly advance our knowledge of cold nociception by addressing three open questions: (1) How do
changes in the mechanical and fluidic properties of the membrane and cytoskeleton contribute to cold-evoked
behavior? (2) How do mechanoreceptor channels contribute to cold somatosensation? (3) How does a
heterogeneous population of sensory transduction receptors, including non-canonical receptor channels and G-
protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) contribute to cold sensation? More generally, the bi-directional integration of
experimental and computational approaches in a closed-loop investigational strategy is well-suited to transform
our understanding of cold nociception by elucidating potentially generalizable mechanisms of cold coding,
including biophysical impacts of cold and conserved transduction machinery."
10980744,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immunotherapies based on the blockade of immune checkpoints have revolutionized cancer treatment in recent
years. Today, immune checkpoint inhibitors in development aim to reactivate tumor-infiltrating T cells to facilitate
tumor cell death. In many tumor types, however, the most abundant form of infiltrating immune cells are myeloid
cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils, which can be tumoricidal as well as tumor promoting.
Consequently, targeting immune checkpoints that regulate both T cells and myeloid cells may have broad
implications for cancer immunotherapy. CD200R, initially identified as a myeloid-restricted, inhibitory immune
receptor, was later also discovered to be expressed within the lymphoid lineage, especially in tumor-infiltrating
effector T cells. Clinical trials of patients with advanced cancers are underway using antibody therapeutics to
block this pathway. Unfortunately, a lack of understanding of how this pathway works in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) substantially compromises its application in cancer immunotherapy. In our recent
studies, we found that CD200R-deficient mice were significantly more efficient in rejecting multiple lineages of
CD200+ tumors. CD200R-deficiency resulted in the dysregulation of chemokines in myeloid cells, consistent with
fewer neutrophils and more eosinophils and other immune effectors in tumors. Additionally, we found that
CD200R-deficient tumor antigen-specific T cells had a unique phenotype and showed more potent anti-tumor
activity in vivo. Intriguingly, CD200R-deficiency in myeloid cells also promoted tumor angiogenesis. The overall
goals of this proposal are to test the hypotheses that CD200R blockade enhances chemokine-mediated
accumulation of immune effectors in tumors and enhances T cell functions in TME, and simultaneous inhibition
of angiogenesis will significantly improve the efficacy of CD200R blockade therapy. To achieve these goals, we
will first evaluate the roles of key chemokines regulated by CD200R signaling in recruiting immune effectors to
tumors and investigate their roles in tumor angiogenesis (Aim 1). Second, we will use mice with CD200R-
deficency in T cells to evaluate the intrinsic roles of CD200R signaling in regulating T cell accumulation and
function in tumors (Aim 2). These two aims will pave the way towards a third test on whether high affinity
antagonist antibody to CD200R has better efficacy, and if CD200R blockade and angiogenesis inhibitors have
synergistic effects in inhibiting tumor growth (Aim 3). Information generated from these studies will not only
advance our understanding of cancer pathogenesis but also pave the way for human trials of CD200R blockade-
based combination therapies."
10980746,"Abstract
Large-scale epidemiologic studies, including biobanks and genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), are now rapidly leading to the identification of novel risk factors for
complex diseases. There is increasing opportunity to develop comprehensive models for
disease risk incorporating genetic markers, other biomarkers, life-style factors and
sociodemographic indicators. There are, however, major challenges as information on all
of the potential risk factors are often not available in a single adequately large study.
Instead, information may be available from different studies, each of which may include
some subsets of the desired variables. Further, because of privacy concerns with
individual-level data, only summary-level information, i.e., estimates of model
parameters, may be available from some studies. We propose to develop a series of
novel statistical methods that will allow data integration across disparate datasets to
tackle modern problems faced in genetic and epidemiologic studies. In Aim 1, we will
develop a framework for building generalized linear models using detail covariate data
from a main study, while incorporating summary-statistics information from an external
study. We will develop a series of applications of this framework to GWAS where we will
use covariate data from biobanks and perform combined analysis with external summary-
statistics data for powerful exploration of gene-environment interactions and mediations.
In Aim 2, we will extend the proposed framework of Aim 1 for developing models with
high-dimensional covariates with regularized parameter estimates. We will develop novel
computational algorithms for practical implementation of the method for large-scale data
analysis and develop new theory for inference on model parameters. We will further
develop application of the proposed method for fine-mapping and polygenic risk score
analysis conditional on covariates. In Aim 3, we will develop applications of the data
integration framework to account for different accuracy/depth of disease outcome data
across different studies. We will illustrate applications of different methods across the
aims using datasets on cancers (breast, melanoma and lung), cardiometabolic traits
(type-2 diabetes and coronary artery disease) and a psychiatric disorder (major
depression disorder). We will distribute develop and freely distribute user friendly
software."

Sale of cannabis for recreational use is rapidly becoming legal across states in the US. While cannabis use
policies typically contain marketing restrictions, including prohibitions on misleading marketing claims, there is
limited research to inform operationalization of these policies, and these policies are rarely enforced. Cannabis
products are often labeled based on “species” or cultivar (Indica, Sativa, or Hybrid). Notably, there is limited
evidence that different species consistently have different profiles of chemical constituents. Despite this,
cannabis is marketed directly to consumers with product labels “Indica”, “Sativa”, and “Hybrid”, and with
corresponding marketing claims that the product has sedative (e.g., relaxation, sleepiness) or energizing (e.g.,
focus, productivity, physical activity) effects. Consumers also report experiencing sedative effects from Indica-
labeled cannabis and energizing effects from Sativa-labeled cannabis. This may translate into unsafe use: our
prior work has found consumers are more likely to report using Sativa-labeled (vs. Indica-labeled) cannabis
before driving or going to work. Despite the potential for public health harm, there is no data demonstrating
whether product perceptions, use expectancies, and subjective and objective acute effects of use vary by label
or marketing claim. Research from other consumer domains, including tobacco, indicates that labeling and
marketing can have powerful effects on product perceptions, use behavior, and use experience. Marketing and
labeling for cannabis could similarly foster inaccurate product perceptions (e.g., regarding harm), expectancy
effects (e.g., anticipating a product to increase focus) and lead to unsafe use (e.g., while driving). This
undermines initiatives to promote safe use of cannabis and risks public health. To date, controlled research
has not systematically evaluated how product labeling (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid) or associated marketing claims
(sedative vs. energizing) affect use behavior, risk perception, or acute drug effects. The proposed research
uses a large-scale content analysis of cannabis labeling and marketing (Aim 1), a randomized online
experiment (Aim 2), and a placebo-controlled randomized laboratory experiment (Aim 3) to document the
scope and effects of cannabis labeling (Indica, Sativa, Hybrid) and marketing claims (sedative, energizing).
Ultimately, this work will provide evidence to inform cannabis marketing and labeling policies, which are
necessary to protect public health."

Chronic pain represents a serious and growing health concern that affects at least one in five
American adults. Despite the high risk of tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction, opioid
analgesics continue to be a major component of pain management. Furthermore, opioids are only
weakly effective for the approximately 30-40% of chronic pain patients suffering from neuropathic
pain arising from lesions or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Non-opioid first-line
treatments for neuropathic pain are also only marginally effective and suffer from serious adverse
effects. Clearly, there is an urgent need for new analgesic drug targets and for new classes of
drugs that can effectively and safely treat neuropathic pain. The long-term goal of this research
project is to fill this gap by establishing the role of the α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
(nAChR) in neuropathic pain and developing effective antagonists against it. Evidence from
peptidic α9α10 antagonists and α9-knockout mice indicates that inhibition of α9α10 function
successfully attenuates allodynia and hyperalgesia in several animal models of neuropathic pain.
However, the poor drug-like properties of existing α9α10 antagonists hinders them from being
easily translated into the clinic. Previous efforts to discover novel α9α10 ligands have been
thwarted by technical challenges in adapting α9α10 nAChRs for high-throughput screening and
compound optimization assays. Furthermore, the difficulty in expressing α9α10 in mammalian
cells has left unanswered questions regarding the structure and function of this promising drug
target. Building on a recent discovery that TMIE is an essential auxiliary protein for α9α10 receptor
expression, we have engineered a novel HEK293 cell line that stably expresses functional α9α10
receptors. The objective of this application is to leverage this innovative cell line to develop novel
α9α10 antagonists and interrogate the location, function, and structure of the receptor. Moreover,
we will investigate the in vivo efficacy of pharmacological inhibition of α9α10 activity in multiple
neuropathic pain models in mice, studying both spontaneous pain and evoked hypersensitivity.
The results from these studies will provide strong evidence that α9α10 nAChRs play a causal role
in driving neuropathic pain and represent a bona fide target for analgesia, and will deliver
promising lead compounds targeting this mechanism."
10982109,"Approximately 50% of patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer develop brain metastasis (BM), which is
associated with poor prognosis and accelerated mortality. There is a long-term unmet need to better define and
target the molecular mechanisms underlying BM in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. We recently identified S100A9
as a key mediator of BM. Our collaborative preliminary studies demonstrate that (i) high S100A9 expression
correlates with aggressive BM and therapy resistance in mouse models and patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancer; (ii) depletion of S100A9 suppresses BM in mouse models; (iii) expression of S100A9 is epigenetically
driven by both histone lysine methylation and the MEIS1 transcription factor; (iv) S100A9 exhibits a non-
canonical nuclear function that transcriptionally activates pro-metastatic pathways in the brain. Therefore, the
goal of our proposal is to identify potentially targetable up- and down-stream mechanisms of S100A9-mediated
BM to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to treat BM in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. To this end, we
will employ a multidisciplinary approach that leverages the complementary expertise of the Acharyya and Lu
labs, spanning from cancer metastasis biology and modeling to chromatin biology and epigenomics. In Aim 1,
we will test the hypothesis that S100A9 expression in BM-proficient S100A9-high expressing cells is regulated
by the collective actions of histone H3K36 and H3K27 methylation and MEIS1-mediated transcription, using a
combination of epigenome-profiling and -editing technologies. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that S100A9 induces
BM by functioning as a transcriptional activator to drive expression of the pro-metastatic gene CES1, which alters
lipid metabolism. We will employ immunocompetent and patient-derived BM models and slice assays to
investigate how chromatin-bound S100A9 promotes BM through CES1 activation and whether pharmacological
inhibition of CES1 can suppress BM in vivo. Our proposal represents the first study to explore the epigenetic
regulation and nuclear function of S100A9 in BM. These studies are impactful because they will nominate
actionable therapeutic approaches to target S100A9, with far-reaching clinical implications for the development
of effective BM therapies for cancer patients."
10978536,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advanced heart diseases lead to a reduced blood supply from the heart and consequently fatigue and deficits in
performing physical activity. In the proposed research, we will assess the lack of physiological reserve in older
adults with advanced heart disease, focusing on motor and cardiac function, to develop a novel, objective, quick,
and accurate frailty score. We designed this approach to enhance candidate selection of older adults going
through invasive therapies for advanced heart diseases. Although our approach is generic, to reduce between-
subject variability we focus on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for older adult with aortic stenosis.
Therapeutic options continue to grow for TAVR; however, it can be difficult to identify candidates with frailty level
that prohibit them from tolerating the stress from aggressive therapy and those with potential reversible frailty. It
is thus critically important to introduce meaningful routine objective frailty assessment into clinical care of cardiac
patients. Frailty assessment is, however, not common in cardiology because current assessment tools are
burdensome for older adults with advanced heart disease and impractical to implement in busy clinical
environments. More importantly, no disease-specific tool is available to identify heart disease-related frailty.
In continuation of our research program in the field of sensor-based frailty assessment, within our
multidisciplinary team of engineers, cardiologists, and geriatricians, we propose the multimodal upper-extremity
function (UEF) test for identifying frailty among older adults with advanced heart disease. UEF incorporates a
synchronized system of motion sensors and electrocardiography (ECG) to measure motor performance and
heart rate (HR) during a rapid 20-second elbow flexion task. Using our previously established UEF motion
tracking component, we can precisely measure the level of deficits in motor performance (slowness, weakness,
inflexibility, and fatigue), which are not detectable using eyeball assessment. Using the ECG setup, minimizing
the motion artifact using this localized task, we accurately track HR response to the physical demand, as well as
recovery behavior after the task. HR behavior during the task and recovery (HR dynamics) provide a measure
of cardiac reserve associated with frailty in heart disease. We will further quantify dysregulation between HR
response and motor demand as a novel measure of resilience. Based on our preliminary data, we expect a
weaker and delayed HR response to physical activity as well as an impaired motor function due to frailty.
The proposed research will be a four-year study at the University of Arizona Cardiovascular program. In the first
arm, we will establish a new HR score and merge it with our previously validated UEF motor score to develop a
multimodal frailty score among older adults with advanced heart disease (n=120). In the second arm, in a
longitudinally setting we will validate the UEF multimodal frailty score for predicting TAVR complications for
advanced heart disease (n=75). Accomplishing these aims, we will promote HR dynamic assessment for risk
stratification of older adults with advanced heart disease, with huge potentials for other comorbid conditions."

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complication of cirrhosis characterized by cognitive, psychological, and
motor dysfunction that is associated with decreased quality of life and poor survival. Unfortunately, current
treatments for HE only have modest efficacy in preventing overt (or clinically apparent) HE episodes. Novel
therapies are desperately needed to alleviate the burden of HE, and targeting the microbiome is a promising
therapeutic pathway. HE is thought to result from translocation of bacterial products across a permeable
intestinal epithelium, which bypass the dysfunctional liver and reach the brain. Dr. Bloom’s preliminary work
shows that specific gut bacteria are associated with impaired intestinal barrier function and may influence HE.
Despite this initial work, there is limited data regarding the most promising microbiome targets for HE treatment
– a gap that Dr. Bloom plans to address in this proposal. Her central hypothesis is that microbiome-targeted
therapies can treat and prevent HE. Her aims are to 1) identify host and microbiome features associated with
future overt HE, and 2) compare mechanisms of microbiome-targeted therapies to treat minimal HE. In order to
accomplish Aim 1, she will conduct a prospective cohort study that will enroll 150 patients with cirrhosis: 75
patients with a history of overt HE and 75 patients with no history of overt HE but at high risk. At baseline, she
will collect microbiome and host data. She will then prospectively follow all patients for 6 months to identify
interval overt HE, while collecting serial microbiome and host data. In order to accomplish Aim 2, she will
conduct a pilot clinical trial in 60 patients with cirrhosis and minimal HE. She will randomize patients to 1)
lactulose (standard of care), 2) polyethylene glycol (used as alternative to standard of care), or 3) potato
starch. She will evaluate microbiome composition and function and cognitive function before, during, and after
therapy. The primary outcome will be change in stool short-chain fatty acids with treatment. These proposed
studies will identify host and microbiome features closely associated with HE and determine the impact of HE
therapies in reversing HE-associated microbiome features. During the K23 award period, Dr. Bloom will
acquire knowledge and skills in three core research domains: rigorous clinical trial design, microbiome
sequencing analysis, and statistical modeling. She will achieve these training goals through hands-on
mentorship, a Masters in Public Health, other formal didactics, several regular group meetings, and attending
academic conferences. Dr. Bloom will specifically learn how to perform clinical trials of microbiome-targeted
therapies, analyze metagenomic sequencing to interpret bacterial community composition and function, and
develop multi-dimensional models that include multi-omics (microbiome and metabolome) and longitudinal
data to better understand the pathogenesis of HE and mechanism of microbiome-targeted therapies. Through
this K23 career development award, Dr. Bloom will achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent
clinical and translational investigator who can design and lead trials of microbiome-targeted therapies for HE."
10978807,"Project Summary
Enterobacterales are increasingly resistant to multiple antibiotics, making them a global epidemic public health
threat. Multi-drug resistant Enterobacterales (MDR Ent) infections were historically limited to healthcare settings,
but over the past two decades there have been significant increases in infections occurring in otherwise healthy
children and adults without prior healthcare contact. These community-acquired (CA) MDR Ent strains are
epidemiologically and genetically distinct from healthcare-acquired strains, yet similarly associated with severe
infections, high costs, long hospital stays, subsequent nosocomial spread, and poor outcomes. Importantly, MDR
Ent strains have been recovered from multiple environmental and animal reservoirs, yet the contribution of these
sources to community-acquired human infection is unclear. We recently discovered that children residing in the
South and Southwest regions of Chicago had a striking 5-fold greater odds of CA-MDR Ent infection than children
living in the West region. Children residing in Central and Northwest Chicago had a >80% decreased odds of
such infections. Surprisingly, MDR Ent infections were 4-34x more likely to be community-acquired than were
infections with susceptible strains. This seeming paradox highlights critical gaps in knowledge of transmission
dynamics, reservoirs, sources, and origins of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in CA-MDR Ent. Such
information is needed to inform strategies to interrupt community transmission. The clustering of CA-MDR Ent
infections in the South and Southwest Chicago “high-risk” regions makes it an ideal setting to investigate
environmental reservoirs of MDR Ent. The proposed studies will integrate genomic and epidemiologic data to
help define transmission pathways of MDR Ent. The proposal has two aims: 1) Profile MDR Ent and mobile
ARGs in Greater Chicago Area waterways and identify environmental reservoirs associated with community
acquisition of MDR Ent; 2) Assess risk factors for colonization with CA-MDR Ent and transmission dynamics of
CA-MDR Ent among community members located in established regions with high risk of infection. This will be
accomplished by: (1) sampling waterways and evaluating the relative contributions of key sources of
contamination (e.g., wastewater treatment plants, farms, and waterfowl) within the high-risk region relative to the
control (low-risk) region, (2) surveying the households of waterway users and residents in the high-risk region
for risk factors and MDR Ent colonization, (3) comprehensive multi-dimensional culture-, metagenomic (MGS)-,
and whole genome sequence (WGS)-based characterization of bacteria and ARGs within environmental, animal,
and human reservoirs to comprehensively track dissemination patterns of resistant genotypes. MGS and WGS
data will be compared across aims to identify sources of CA-MDR Ent. With knowledge generated through this
rigorous research, we can identify targeted interventions for reducing exposure to MDR Ent in healthy persons,
thereby decreasing infections, hospital admissions, healthcare costs and community spread of MDR Ent."

Understanding how co-morbidities in persons with HIV (PWH) such as substance use affect risk-taking, decision-
making, and other cognitive behaviors is important given implications for everyday functioning and transmission
risk. The high prevalence of cannabis use in PWH, medicinally and recreationally, may indicate disease severity,
impart therapeutic benefits, or adverse consequences. In fact, cannabis is recommended to those with HIV to
alleviate nausea, improve appetite, relieve pain, and lift mood. To-date, the consequences of cannabis use in
PWH remain unclear as do potential interactions with HIV treatments. In healthy participants, heavy cannabis
use is associated with cognitive deficits e.g., risky decision-making, response disinhibition and inattention, but
pro-cognitive effects in PWH may exist at mild use levels due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-excitotoxic
properties. Furthermore, little has been done to determine the effects of cannabis use on the endocannabinoid
(EC) system in general or in PWH. This area of study is especially germane to cognition since the virus affects
brain regions rich in ECs. CNS relevance is of particular importance given that the EC system exerts regulatory
effects over the dopaminergic system, critical for these cognitive processes. This application will utilize a cross-
species approach to delineate the effects EC system activation has on HIV-relevant cognitive and motivational
domains. Animal studies enable mechanistic insights on chronic and withdrawal effects in this system. Both
behavioral and mechanistic overlap will occur between the human and animal studies. Specific Aim 1 will
determine the effects of the two primary cannabis constituents (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol [THC], cannabidiol
[CBD]) vs. placebo on risky decision-making, response inhibition, reward learning, temporal perception, and
motivation, plus EC and homovanillic acid (HVA; a surrogate for dopamine activity) levels in HIV+ and HIV-
subjects. Participants with infrequent cannabis use will undergo baseline cognitive testing and biomarker assays
with antiretrovirals (ART) use quantified. They will be randomized to a 5-day course of either THC, CBD, or
placebo and return for follow-up testing and re-assaying of ECs and HVA levels. Specific Aim 2 will conduct
parallel experiments in a rodent model of HIV on acute, chronic, and withdrawal effects of 2 doses of THC vs. 2
doses of CBD, plus combined THC/CBD/ART (dolutegravir) on the same cognitive and motivational tests, plus
EC and HVA levels to provide directionality and potential interaction of drug effects. Each experiment will train
and test HIV-1 transgenic and wildtype littermate rats on cross-species versions of tasks used in Aim 1. Rats will
be tested at baseline, immediately after acute, then chronic treatment, then during withdrawal. The brains of rats
will be harvested and assessed for EC and dopamine receptor levels to determine potential mechanisms of the
beneficial/negative effects of cannabinoid treatments on symptoms related to HIV. Disentangling the cognitive
and biological effects of THC and CBD and their relation with ART is a much-needed advance in the HIV field
and will inform development of therapeutics and policy advice for co-morbid substance use."
10985817,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The genome in human skin is routinely damaged by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and other environmental
genotoxins that are known to induce systemic inflammation. My recent work demonstrates that keratinocytes
exposed to UVB radiation release small extracellular vesicles (EVs) with DNA containing cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers (CPDs), or adduct-containing DNA (acDNA), that are capable of being taken up by bystander cells. My
preliminary evidence indicates CPD transport to lymph nodes in mice, and others have measured CPD excretion
in human urine. However, the role of extracellular environmental genotoxin-damaged DNA in systemic
inflammatory responses has not previously been explored. Many patients with autoinflammatory disorders, such
as lupus, have photosensitivity. Moreover, nearly two-thirds present with reduced activities of nucleases that
degrade immunogenic circulating extracellular DNA. The lack of understanding about the role of extracellular
acDNA in autoimmune disorders presents a major gap in the field. Thus, the objective of this application is to
test my hypothesis that deficiencies in serum nuclease activity and the presence of UV photoproducts in EVs
compound systemic inflammatory responses in patients with photosensitive autoimmune disorders. First, Aim 1
(K99) seeks to demonstrate CPD content in urine EVs and correlate acDNA content with lupus disease severity
indicators and serum nuclease activity. To further map systemic circulation and impact of acDNA, Aim 2
(K99/R00) will measure acDNA transfer to organs and damage-dependent responses in mouse models of lupus
with nuclease deficiencies. Lastly, Aim 3 (R00) will define mechanisms of release and response of acDNA in
EVs in context of common autoimmune nuclease deficiencies. These findings will have broad applicability to the
NIEHS because our model of UVB-damaged DNA transfer is expected to extend to other acDNA-inducing
environmental genotoxins. Thus, my research findings may improve treatments for photosensitive autoimmune
disorders and provide new ways of quantifying environmental genotoxin exposure.
 The training in this K99/R00 proposal seeks to expand upon my background in chemistry, biology, and
skin explant research. I will solidify training in the use of mouse models and human subjects research so that I
may establish an independent lab researching the impact of damaged DNA and EVs in photosensitive
autoimmune disease. This training will be facilitated by the strong translational research environment at Wright
State University. Drs Travers, Brown, and Mahoney (external) bring expertise in extracellular particle
characterization and immunogenic response, while Dr. Kemp is an expert in DNA damage responses, and Dr.
Crawford is an expert in epidemiology. I will also continue my education to obtain my masters in Clinical Trials
Coordination and train through courses in epidemiology and biostatistics through the WSU Department of
Population and Public Health Sciences. Thus, this K99/R00 award will enable my transition to an independent
research faculty capable of performing strong translational research on the impact of circulating damaged DNA."
10990452,"The growth factors and transcriptional activators that give rise to diverse populations of functionally distinct
circulating monocytes and tissue-resident macrophages (MFs) have largely been identified. In contrast, the
influence of metabolic signals from the local tissue microenvironment on MF differentiation and function remains
essentially unexplored. One endogenous signal that been associated to MF differentiation in homeostatic
conditions is the essential metabolite heme, the body’s main purveyor of iron, which directs red pulp MF (RPM)
differentiation. As RPMs degrade senescent red blood cells, they accrue large amounts of hemoglobin-derived
heme. This buildup of intracellular heme triggers degradation of the heme-regulated transcriptional repressor
BACH1, thus inducing expression of SPIC1, a transcription factor (TF) required for RPM development. Beyond
its role in regulating RPM differentiation, our preliminary data show that BACH1 plays a previously unappreciated
outsized role in myeloid cells. We find that BACH1 is part of the small set of core factors that regulate MF identity
and function, and that it integrates the transcriptional response to signaling heme and pro-inflammatory stimuli.
Supporting this notion, mice lacking BACH1 in myeloid cells have altered numbers of tissue-resident MFs, and
cells derived from them show reduced fitness in bone marrow transplant repopulation studies. Moreover, myeloid
BACH 1 KO mice have alterations in the inflammatory/repair process in the setting of acute muscle injury, and,
unlike WT littermates, quickly perish when given with a sublethal dose of LPS. Given that BACH1 activity is
regulated by heme, these unexpected findings stress the extent to which heme signaling regulates MF biology
and highlight the need to gain insight into the pathways of intracellular heme delivery that control BACH1 function.
Heme is a vital metabolite for life, but due to its highly oxidative iron content, free heme is very cytotoxic. As
such, heme intracellular mobilization requires a protein network to enable its transfer throughout the cell, the
components of which are largely unknown. We have discovered in adipocytes an intracellular heme trafficking
pathway mediated by the poorly characterized proteins Progesterone Receptor Component 1 and 2 (PGRMC1,
PGRMC2), that delivers heme to proteins in the ER and the nucleus, including heme-responsive TFs such as
BACH1. We recently found that the PGRMC1/2 heme trafficking pathway is active in MFs, and that PGRMC1/2
DKO MFs have increased BACH1 levels and functional defects. Our hypothesis is that in monocytes/MFs, the
PGRMC1/2 pathway is central for delivery of heme to the nucleus, and that BACH1 is a principal mediator of the
effects of heme signaling on MF differentiation and function under normal and pathological conditions. In this
project, we leverage unique mouse models with reduced nuclear heme, chemical tools that increase signaling
heme flux to the nucleus, and new mouse mutants of the key mediator BACH1 to reveal a molecular pathway
for metabolite control of MF differentiation/function."

 The HIV prevention field has realized a long-sought goal to have multiple safe and effective HIV
prevention options that offer women the opportunity to choose a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) product
that best fits their needs and preferences. Product attributes across injectable long-acting cabotegravir,
dapivirine vaginal ring, and oral PrEP differ considerably, with implications for user experience, adherence
requirements, and discreetness. Clinical trials and demonstration projects have highlighted challenges in
achieving sustained PrEP use, and decades of research in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have underscored the
significant role that male partners play in many women’s choice of and ability to consistently use these
methods. Although it remains critically important to center women’s agency in choosing options that meet
their needs, many women want to involve their partners in these decisions and, in many settings, men
influence women’s ability and enable their autonomy to adopt and use prevention effectively. The overall goal
of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a couples-based shared decision-making
intervention called CUPID (Couples United in HIV Prevention Informed Decisions) within the CATALYST
demonstration project in Uganda that offers choice in biomedical PrEP to women. The CUPID intervention
will involve delivery of a paper-based, shared decision-making tool in community and clinic settings by peer
PrEP ambassadors affiliated with Ministry of Health facilities. CUPID aims to influence multiple PrEP
outcomes (uptake, persistence and adherence) through couples’ shared decision making to improve
communication about HIV prevention and PrEP options, mutual commitment to HIV prevention within the
relationship, and partner support for PrEP use.
 We will accomplish this by conducting a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study designed to
refine the CUPID intervention for use in public health settings (Aim 1), evaluate its effectiveness in improving
PrEP uptake, persistence, and use among Ugandan women (Aim 2), and assess implementation outcomes
to inform the adoption and integration of CUPID to support women's PrEP uptake and use (Aim 3). CUPID’s
effectiveness in increasing PrEP use by women will be assessed using a multiple baseline interrupted time-
series design with randomization of health facilities to intervention start time. Implementation outcomes will
assess the acceptability, adoption, feasibility, and fidelity of CUPID using a mixed methods design.
 The study leverages a real-world implementation partnership with the CATALYST study and the Ugandan
Ministry of Health to address the critical question of whether CUPID can optimize women’s PrEP choice and
use through male partner support and shared decision-making using a scalable intervention approach. If
successful, CUPID will offer a community-based strategy for engaging male partners to support PrEP choice
and improve HIV prevention among women."

 Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, age-related, degenerative brain disease. The most notable symptom
is a significant cognitive impairment accompanying a substantial loss of dendritic spines and, eventually, neurons
themselves. Since these end-stages are mostly irreversible, it is critical to identify appropriate molecular targets
for intervention before the synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss become permanent. Brains with Alzheimer's
disease display the presence of increased protein accumulations, such as intracellular tau inclusions
(neurofibrillary tangles) and extracellular beta-amyloid deposits (senile plaques). However, alterations in synaptic
structure, function, and plasticity appear before these pathologies arise in various Alzheimer's disease models,
highlighting the pathological significance of early-stage synaptic alterations, potentially driven by Alzheimer's
disease-associated proteins, as a proximal event in Alzheimer's disease etiology.
 Importantly, it is now widely accepted that local protein synthesis plays essential roles in neurons and, in
particular, that key components of protein synthesis subserving synapses and synaptic plasticity take place in
dendrites, in association with dendritic spines, the cellular site of synaptic plasticity. These observations lead us
to hypothesize that pathogenic forms of tau specifically interfere with dendritic protein synthesis and that this
effect contributes to the pathologic features seen in Alzheimer's disease. We propose to test this hypothesis by
taking advantage of tau pathology model mice and a novel suite of genetically encodable molecular tools
implementable in these animals to address dendritic protein synthesis in the hippocampus.
 Successful completion of this project will enrich our understanding of how tau pathology leads to early
synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease. Ultimately, these studies will provide molecular insights into target
molecules for intervention before the irreversible loss of synapses and neurons in Alzheimer's disease and
related dementia."

Membrane damage by mechanical or biochemical stress, leads to cell death and activation of innate immune
inflammatory pathways, and contributes to the pathology of many inflammatory conditions. Furthermore,
pathogens can secrete pore-forming toxins (PFT) to promote infection and disrupt immunity, and endogenous
pore-forming proteins such as Gasdermin D and MLKL have been shown to contribute to inflammatory signaling
and secretion of cytokines. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to repair membrane damage and maintain
cellular homeostasis, but our understanding of how damage is sensed and linked to repair remains incomplete.
We have recently developed a transposon-based forward genetic screening approach, which we have used to
identify genes that promote resistance to cell death induced by S. aureus α-toxin. We identified the lysosomal
membrane protein LITAF as a cell-autonomous inhibitor of cell death. In preliminary data, we show that LITAF
promotes sequestration of damaged membranes into vesicles through the activation of the ESCRT machinery.
We hypothesize that LITAF acts as an effector of cellular defense against pore-forming proteins, linking sensing
of membrane damage to effector mechanisms of repair. In this application, we propose to test this hypothesis
by: (1) identifying the mechanisms of LITAF activation and function; (2) determining the role of this pathway in
lung inflammation and infection; (3) testing whether LITAF regulates innate immune signaling, inflammasome
activation and inflammatory cell death in macrophages. This research is of high significance as it will provide a
deeper understanding of cellular defense mechanisms against membrane damage, and of the balance between
cell survival and inflammatory cell death. Identifying strategies to counteract membrane damage and prevent
cell death will contribute to understanding and treating the pathology of a wide range of infectious and
inflammatory diseases."

States experience at least one chronic medical condition (CCMC) requiring them to receive
medication during the school day. Adherence to the medications and their scheduled dosing is
crucial for the CCMC’s health and academic progress. However, primary schools are an
understudied community healthcare setting with school nurses (SNs) as the main healthcare
provider. Widespread budgetary cuts have left 18% of schools across the nation with no
designated SN,2,6 leaving the vast majority (78%) of medication administrations to unlicensed
assistive personnel (UAP). Because these individuals are not healthcare providers, medication
errors are three times higher when administered by UAP than by a SN. To reduce medication
errors in schools, we propose a technology-assisted system to help SNs and UAP with
medication administration and documentation. Our proposed computer-based system, the
Electronic School Medication Administration Record (eSMAR). Our system prototype was tried
in simulated environment. Therefore, the purpose of this demonstration project is to implement
eSMAR in a real-world setting (grade schools) and to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of
eSMAR on medication administration and documentation in schools.
Aim 1: Implement and evaluate the usability of eSMAR in a select sample of K-12 schools
in the Iowa City Community School District (ICCSD).
We will achieve this aim by analyzing data from a) usability surveys from SNs and UAP, b)
eSMAR system usage reports, c) observation, filed notes, and semi-structured interviews during
site visits, and c) parent satisfaction survey.
Aim 2: Understand contextual factors influencing eSMAR implementation.
We will achieve this aim by conducting site visits using rapid ethnographic assessment (REA).
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and EPIS domains will inform the
development of the REA measures. Data from Aims 1&2 will be triangulated to deepen our
understanding of contextual variables influencing eSMAR implementation.
Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of eSMAR (number of errors intercepted).
We will achieve this aim by analyzing data from the eSMAR reports for the number, type, and
frequency of errors intercepted by eSMAR. We will compare data on users (SNs vs. UAP), type
of medication, time, medical condition, child’s age and grade level. Data from ICCSD incident
reports will be collected to identify types of errors not prevented by the eSMAR system."

All 3 projects are highly synergistic and center on 2 themes: 1) continuing to accelerate and support clinical trials
in the DM1 space, including preparing for a potentially imminent post-approval landscape; 2) accelerating both

transgenes will be assessed and these studies will be used to test two therapeutic strategies. Project 2 focuses on
clarifying molecular mechanisms underlying several leading therapeutic approaches using a new Dmpk CTG
expansion knockin multisystemic model for DM1 that reproduces characteristic DM1 molecular and
pathophysiological features. Project 3 transitions to current clinical issues by analyzing a large DM1 cohort using
a remote assessment strategy to examine disease severity. A DNA Bank will also be established for
comprehensive analysis of expanded repeats and statistical models will be developed to study relationships
between repeat length, age, sex and disease severity. The hypothesis that variant repeat interruptions are
associated with reductions in disease severity, somatic expansion and mis-splicing will also be tested. For DM2,
remote patient assessments and targeted recruitment will facilitate studies designed to assess roles for RAN
translation and RNA toxicity. In combination with these projects, our Administrative Core will provide rigorous
oversight for all projects and cores and emphasize synergy between the projects and cores. We will continue to
expand our Shared Resource Core since this core is an essential resource for our Wellstone Projects but also
serves the broader research and clinical community focused on dominant muscular dystrophies. Our Training
Core is designed to attract and build competency in the next generation of basic and clinical investigators focused
on DM1 and DM2 by training in wet and dry lab settings and will provide training in communication skills needed
to effectively engage all DM stakeholders."
10993383,"No Changes to the Abstract
Chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI, chemobrain), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy
(CIPN) and gait changes are debilitating side-effects of cancer treatment with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin),
taxanes, and vinca alkaloids. Cisplatin is widely used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat ovarian malignancies.
Over 70% of women report experiencing CRCI, CIPN and/or falls during treatment or after completion, impairing
their quality of life. These neurotoxic impairments can also compromise treatment with cisplatin, influencing
disease progression. Currently, there are no FDA-approved clinical interventions for the treatment of CRCI and
CIPN. Mechanistically, cisplatin-induced neuronal toxicity derives from nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage,
and oxidative stress, which induce the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), p38MAPK
and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our preliminary data show that in vitro
pharmacological inhibition with small molecule inhibitors, i.e., neflamapimod for p38MAPK and SP600125 for
JNK, prevents cisplatin-induced reduction in dendritic spine branching and density. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that inhibition of the p38MAPK/JNK pathways will prevent cisplatin-induced neuronal
apoptosis and damage, leading to attenuation of cognitive impairments, gait changes, and neuropathic
pain associated with CRCI and CIPN. In this project, we propose to determine if: (1) cisplatin-induced p38
MAPK/JNK signaling underlies structural and functional neuronal damage, using in vitro pharmacological
inhibition and siRNA silencing; (2) neflamapimod and SP600125 prevent cisplatin-induced neuropathy and gait
alterations in the ID8 syngeneic epithelial ovarian cancer in C57BL/6 mice and the transgenic breast cancer
model C3TAg in FVBN mice; and (3) cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity is attenuated by p38MAPK/JNK inhibition
without compromising its anti-cancer activity. Our Approach includes in vitro analysis of 2 separate neuronal cell
lines, behavioral analysis using sensory testing for CIPN, testing of cognitive impairment, and novel
MouseWalker for gait changes in female mice using the two mouse cancer models. The proposed studies will
demonstrate the role of the p38MAPK and JNK in cisplatin induced CRCI/CIPN, and translational potential for
novel strategies to treat CRCI and CIPN. Due to health disparities, women suffer more disproportionately from
cancer and pain-related treatment than men. Therefore, testing our hypothesis in female mice is expected to
significantly advance the understanding and treatment of cisplatin-induced neurotoxic side effects and improve
the quality of life for women with cancer. Nevertheless, we expect that these findings may also apply to cisplatin-
induced neurotoxicity in males and to other cancers than ovarian and breast cancers."
10991873,"Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias are neurodegenerative disorders of paramount importance, in
particular as medical advances continue to extend human lifespans and as the population continues to age. As
of 2023, AD impacts roughly 55 million people worldwide and is projected to triple by 2050, costing trillions in
healthcare expenditure and related costs. At its core, AD is a complex pathology in which it is commonly
believed that amyloid β deposition leading to plaque formation and neurofibrillary tangle formation as a result
of tau hyperphosphorylation are the predominant causes. As a result of these processes, there is significant
neuronal dysfunction and damage, effectively leading to the cognitive deficits associated with the development
of dementia. While Amyloid β and Tau are considered major instigators, however, there are also other factors
at play that may be targets for mechanistic treatment of disease. Namely, cerebrovascular blood flow
dysregulation and inflammation. Indeed, it has been shown that these two factors can contribute heavily to the
development of AD and can be related to downstream impacts stemming from amyloid β and Tau, essentially
leading to blood flow restriction, poor oxygen supply, microglial activation and microgliosis, and degradation of
the blood brain barrier. Our aim is to target these processes by focusing on the inhibition of a protein known to
be involved in cerebrovascular blood flow regulation and inflammation: NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2). NOX2 is a
professional producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that has long been linked with inflammation and
vascular regulation in other tissues and has similarly been shown to control these processes in the brain. While
NOX2 largely contributes to many of these processes in a homeostatic manner, overexpression/overactivation
of NOX2 (which has been seen in AD patient brain tissues) can lead to pathological consequences. Our aim is
to specifically inhibit NOX2 as a mechanistic instigator of cerebrovascular dysfunction and microglial
inflammation utilizing our novel, orally bioavailable, blood brain barrier penetrant small molecule NOX2
inhibitors, CPP11G and CPP11H. We will explore these processes by administering (IV/IP/PO) our inhibitors to
a well-established AD mouse model, APP-PS1 mice that have been fitted with cranial windows. We will then
assess mice for various features of AD such as cerebral blood flow and amyloid β deposition (Aim 1), as well
as presence of inflammation by assessing microglia and microgliosis (Aim 2). We will further assess these
mice by collecting tissues and utilizing biochemical tests to test for compound delivery, inflammation (e.g., IL-
1β, TNF-α, IL-6), and other mechanistic parameters of inflammation. Our overall hypothesis is that the
inhibition of NOX2 by CPP11G/H will yield significant improvements in cerebrovascular blood flow dysfunction,
amyloid β deposition, and microglial-associated inflammation. If successful, these studies will have significant
implications for CPP11G/H as potential therapeutics for AD treatment, and will lay a solid foundation for the
continued development of these molecules in future applications."
10982152,"Crohn’s Disease (CD) is a chronic and debilitating disorder with peak incidence in the second and third
decades of life. While considerable progress has been made in optimizing medications to achieve remission,
relapse is common and unpredictable. Altered microbiota likely drive gut inflammation and clinical relapses.
Microbiota-accessible dietary carbohydrates with beneficial health effects, known as “prebiotics,” hold promise
for restoring healthy gut microbiota in CD and preventing clinical relapse. Here, we propose completion of the
first studies of the prebiotic human milk oligosaccharide, 2’-fucosyllactose (2’-FL), for maintaining remission in
CD. Our overarching hypothesis is that 2’-FL supplementation in CD will be safe and well tolerated, while
increasing fecal Bifidobacterium abundance and butyrate in a dose dependent manner. We will test this
hypothesis by completing a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-ranging study which began enrollment
during the tenure of the current award and includes the following Aims: Aim 1. Define dose dependent
safety and tolerability of 2’-FL as a dietary supplement in CD. We will test 1g or 5g 2’-FL compared to 2
gm dextrose placebo as a daily dietary supplement in pediatric and young adult CD patients in stable remission
receiving infliximab or adalimumab anti-TNF therapy. Safety and tolerability will be assessed using validated
clinical disease activity and gastrointestinal symptom rating indices, and fecal calprotectin. Aim 2. Define
dose dependent efficacy of 2’-FL as a dietary supplement in CD. We will utilize our established fecal
metagenomic and metabolite profiling assays to test the effect of a range of 2’FL doses upon the gut microbial
community and associated metabolic functions with a focus upon butyrate production. Efficacy will be
assessed by determining the dose dependent effect of 2’-FL upon increased fecal Bifidobacterium and butyrate
abundance. We will account for FUT2 secretor status and dietary fiber intake in the analysis. These studies
will have a high impact in the field by providing critical phase I/IIa safety and efficacy data in support of a
phase III RCT using our NIH-supported CD clinical research network to test the efficacy of 2’-FL in directly
modulating beneficial microbiota and thereby enhancing sustained clinical remission and mucosal healing.
Ultimately the proposed studies will promote a fundamental shift in clinical practice towards personalized
microbial therapeutic interventions."
10982242,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer among men. Radiation therapy is an integral part of the
standard of care for the treatment of PCa. Local recurrences of PCa after radiation therapy usually originate
from the primary tumor site. A dose escalation to the clinically significant tumor (csT) foci in intermediate- and
high-risk patients is reported to result in significantly improved biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS)
without increasing radiation toxicity. Contouring of the intraprostatic tumor is currently based on
multiparametric (mp-) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the interpretation of the MRI results are based
on Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS). However, relatively large variability in performance
of mp-MRI, including that of PI-RADS, continue to pose barriers to identify clinically significant prostate tumor
as treatment target and improve patient outcome. In this project, we propose to address the issues in both the
MRI technique and scoring system aspects and develop a tool that can automatically delineate intraprostatic
csT and be easily transferred to clinical use. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will build a quantitative MRI
(QMRI) toolset including magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), arterial spin labeling (ASL), and diffusion-
weighted MRI (DW-MRI). This toolset provides 3-dimensional high-resolution quantitative maps directly
associated with tumor physiology and pathology features. In Aim 2, based on the QMRI output, we will develop
an automated PCa tumor probability model and segmentation method that can automatically differentiate areas
with clinically significant prostate cancer from other prostatic tissues. Aim 3 will be a validation study. We will
validate the performance of our newly developed method against biopsy results and compare it with the
performance of physician's contour of csT foci based on mp-MRI and PI-RADS as the current standard of care
(SOC). We expect that the results of this project will provide a completely new set of QMRI tools and tumor
segmentation method that improves current SOC mp-MRI and PI-RADS. This will allow us to accurately
identify areas with clinically significant PCa in the intact prostate for boost irradiation, and achieve maximal
local control in prostate cancer radiation therapy without increasing radiation toxicity."
10980774,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vibrio cholerae causes 3 million cases of cholera and 100,000 deaths annually. It also causes large and
deadly epidemics of disease in areas affected by climate and conflict associated humanitarian disasters.
Vaccination is a pillar of the World Health Organization’s plan to reduce cholera mortality by 90% in 2030.
However, cholera vaccine shortages in the face of increasing demand have limited or halted numerous
planned vaccination campaigns globally. Although new, low-cost oral cholera vaccines have been developed
to improve supply, there is no agreement on how to introduce these new vaccines or evaluate their
effectiveness. Traditional randomized trials to test new cholera vaccines require hundreds of thousands of
participants, and the availability of other vaccines with proven effectiveness makes such large-scale trails of
new vaccines unethical. Case-control studies to gauge vaccine effectiveness are another option for testing new
vaccines but these are also resource-intensive and are subject to bias.
 For these reasons, the lack of ‘correlates of protection’ (or CoPs) against cholera is a major obstacle to
cholera vaccine development. CoPs are measures of immunity which are accepted markers of an effective
immune response to vaccination. While other infectious diseases have well established CoPs, there are no
widely accepted CoPs for cholera.
 To overcome this obstacle, we will identify better CoPs for oral cholera vaccines. We will also compare
these to CoPs derived from natural infection with V. cholerae. This proposal builds on our preliminary data
which shows that several novel antibody-markers distinguish between protected and susceptible individuals
after infection with V. cholerae. This evidence supports our premise that vaccination also will produce immune
responses that accurately predict subsequent immunity to cholera. To test this hypothesis, we will follow a
prospective, longitudinal cohort to identify both natural infection- and vaccine-induced CoPs which distinguish
between subsequently protected and susceptible individuals. The study will be performed both in older children
and adults, as well as young children, who are less well protected by current cholera vaccines.
 Ultimately, we expect this study to identify new and better performing CoPs for cholera. The results will
improve our understanding of human immunity to cholera, and directly impact human health by accelerating
the development and licensure of new and better performing cholera vaccines."
10978829,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
DNA methylation (DNAm) aberrancies are hallmarks of colorectal cancer (CRC) and substantially outnumber
somatic mutations. So far, most DNAm studies have focused on CRC tissues. In contrast, DNAm changes in
prediagnostic blood are poorly characterized in individuals with CRC but have great promise for early detection.
Moreover, DNAm is potentially modifiable and thus represents one of the most promising targets for early
interception of CRC. Therefore, we propose the largest prospective study to date to characterize the
landscape of genome-wide DNAm markers associated with CRC and examine the biological role of blood DNAm
in CRC. Our central hypothesis is that DNAm alterations in pre-diagnosis blood predict CRC risk, underlies the
genetic effect on CRC susceptibility and tumor gene expression, and capture lifestyle-related changes in the
aging and systemic immune pathways underlying CRC development. To address this hypothesis, we will
leverage the genome-wide DNAm analysis supported by X01 HG012677 in pre-diagnosis white blood cells
of 1,150 cases and 2,460 matched controls identified from 4 prospective cohorts of racially diverse men and
women, including the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHS2, Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS), and
Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS). Participants have provided diet/lifestyle data every 2-4 years over the
past 20-40 years; ~80% of the cases and controls have been genotyped in prior genome-wide association
studies; and a subset of them have also provided up to two blood samples 10 years apart (250 cases, 500
matched controls) and CRC tumor tissues with available RNA sequencing (n~250) and other molecular data
(n~460). In Aim 1, we will characterize the landscape of genome-wide DNAm markers in pre-diagnosis blood
associated with CRC incidence through an epigenome-wide association analysis and assess to what extent
adding DNAm markers can improve the performance of established CRC risk assessment tools based on known
epidemiologic risk factors. In Aim 2, we will integrate blood DNAm with germline genetics, DNAm quantitative
trait loci, and tumor gene expression data to identify DNAm pathways underlying the genetic effect on CRC
development and examine the association of blood DNAm with tumor gene expression. In Aim 3, we will
prospectively examine epigenetic age acceleration (difference in epigenetic and chronological age) and DNAm-
based estimates of circulating immune cell compositions in relation to CRC. We will also link epigenetic aging
and immunity to tumoral molecular markers to inform biology. In addition, we will develop a diet/lifestyle score to
characterize individuals’ potential of epigenetic aging and systemic immune modulatory capacity and associate
this score with CRC risk. Taken together, with the support of the already approved X01, investigations of these
aims in 4 large established cohorts provides a cost-efficient opportunity to prospectively characterize the role
of DNAm in CRC onset and develop potential DNAm-based strategies for CRC risk stratification and prevention."
10982961,"Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant exposures
in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment, structural
racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child development, it is
imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of life be established
based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To accomplish this, the
Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed to deploy a
harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented by an
extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the United
States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-NC
Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-
dimensional dataset that will characterize typical neurodevelopmental trajectories in US children and that will
assess how biological and environmental exposures affect those trajectories. A special emphasis will be placed
on understanding the impact of pre- and postnatal exposure to opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco and/or other
substances. To address these broad objectives, the sample of women enrolled will include: 1) a racially,
ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2) pregnant women
with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3) demographically and behaviorally
similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC
will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and protective environments have the most
influence on later neurodevelopmental outcomes. The large, multi-modal, longitudinal, and generalizable dataset
that will be produced for the first time by this study will provide novel insights into child development using state-
of-the-art methods. The HBCD-NC study will inform public policy to improve the health and development of
children across the nation."
10985760,"Project Abstract
Immune checkpoint therapies have shown remarkable efficacy across multiple tumor types by amplifying cancer-
immunity and boosting T-cell immune response against tumors. As an increasing number of immune checkpoint
molecules have been identified, numerous combination therapeutic strategies are under clinical investigation.
For instance, the combination of an OX40 agonist and PD-1 inhibitor has been shown to have promising anti-
tumor effects in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials. Despite remarkable therapeutic benefit, it has become
evident with increasing clinical usage that these agents elevate the risk of immune-related adverse events (irAEs),
especially cardiovascular sequelae. Mitigating irAEs is critical for the establishment of efficacious and safe
interventions. Currently, little is understood regarding the cardiac effects of combined OX40 activation and PD-
1 inhibition.
In this proposal, the PI aims to investigate 1) how cardiac T-cells respond to combined PD-1 inhibition
and OX40 activation and sequentially reshape the cardiac immune landscape; 2) the mechanism by
which the reshaped T-cell landscape modulates monocytes recruitment, differentiation and immune cell
crosstalk; and 3) investigate mechanisms by which combined OX40 activation and PD-1 inhibition leads
to myocardial vulnerability. At the end of this award period, the PI will have generated a deep understanding
of how a new combination immunotherapy (OX40 activation and PD-1 inhibition) reshapes the cardiac immune
landscape and sensitizes the heart to future injury. The PI will leverage new technologies including spectral flow
cytometry, single-cell CITE-seq, TCR-seq and advanced computational biology techniques. The PI will also
uncover mechanism-based therapeutic targets to prevent or treat cardiac adverse events elicited by combined
OX40 activation and PD-1 inhibition.
The career development goal of this proposal is to aid in the PI’s success in becoming an independent
investigator. The PI has previously obtained a PhD in tumor immunology and completed 4 years of postdoctoral
training in cardiac immunology. The proposed 2-year mentored research time under this award will provide the
PI with formal training in cardiac T-cell immunology and cardio-oncology, computational biology, and grant-
writing. Additionally, the mentorship team and advisory committee will provide training and advice on
management skills, technical skills, and making early career decisions. By completing this award period, the PI
will have acquired the skills necessary to become a successful independent researcher."
10985894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Clinical deterioration in the PICU, as defined by new or progressive organ dysfunction, occurs in
up to 5% of critically ill children during their first week of admission. Importantly, patients with progressive
organ dysfunction have a mortality rate as high as 50%, with over 20% of survivors experiencing moderate to
severe disability. Earlier recognition of patients at high risk of clinical deterioration is critically needed to inform
treatment decisions and personalize health care delivery, which would lead to improved patient outcomes.
However, timely prediction is challenging due to limitations in existing models. The few models that try to
predict clinical deterioration do not leverage metrics from high-frequency physiological monitor data, such as
heart rate variability (HRV), despite evidence that these data are highly predictive of deterioration. For the
proposed K23 award, I will examine clinical deterioration in the context of new or worsening cardiovascular
and/or respiratory (cardiorespiratory) dysfunction in mechanically ventilated children. My central hypothesis is
that a longitudinal, multivariable prediction model of clinical deterioration that incorporates high-frequency
physiological monitor data and clinical variables will accurately identify children at risk of new or worsening
cardiorespiratory dysfunction and that this model will be useful and acceptable to clinicians.
Aim 1. Derive, validate, and compare longitudinal prediction models of new or worsening
cardiorespiratory dysfunction in critically ill children requiring mechanical ventilation.
Aim 2. Design for the implementation of a clinical deterioration model to improve use in practice.
Innovation: Our innovative approach includes (1) high-frequency physiological data, (2) advanced machine
learning applications, and (3) a user-centered design approach to optimize the implementation plan.
Approach: Aim 1: I will derive and compare machine learning-based prediction models using physiological
and EHR-based clinical data in a single center. I will then perform internal and external validation of the best
performing model. Aim 2: Using user-centered design principles with critical care clinicians, I will elicit the ideal
packaging and implementation plan for incorporating a clinical deterioration model into practice. Then, I will
lead iterative usability testing of the design and implementation plan to assess acceptability, usefulness, and
desirability. This approach will identify the ideal packaging and implementation plan for the clinicians who will
ultimately use the model.
Anticipated Outcomes and Public Heath Relevance: This study will provide the foundation to: (1) develop
accurate prediction models of deterioration that leverage continuous physiological measures and clinical
variables; (2) implement useful prediction models at the bedside to support clinical decision making; and (3)
design intervention trials to test the impact on patient outcomes."
10989208,"Abstract Activating KRAS mutations occur in 20-40% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). About 20% of
the KRAS mutation tumors have co-occurring mutations of KEAP1 that are resistant to most therapies and
difficult to treat. Therefore new treatments are needed. Currently, we found these co-mutant tumors express high
levels of the histone deacetylase protein HDAC4 important for their survival. KRAS/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLC
cells are sensitive to a HDAC4/5 inhibitor called LMK235 while single mutant cells are not. Knockdown of
HDAC4/5 or treatment with TSA (inhibits Class I/II HDACs including HDACs 4 and 5) has similar effect. Thus,
high HDAC expression represents an Achilles heel that renders co-mutant cells sensitive to LMK235 and
HDAC4/5 inhibition. Mechanistically, we found LMK235 induces toxicity by activating a tumor suppressor protein
called RB and by activating a protein called BIM that triggers cell death. Lastly, we found LMK235 causes striking
synergistic toxicity when combined with the drug AMG510 (sotorasib) in KRASG12C/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLCs.
AMG510 specifically inhibits the KRAS G12C mutant and is FDA approved. In clinical studies, KRAS
G12C/KEAP1 mutant NSCLC tumors responded less well to AMG510 than KRAS G12C tumors with wild-type
KEAP1. This highlights a need to improve treatments in these tumors. The finding that LMK235 causes
synergistic toxicity with AMG510 suggests this drug combination could improve responses in these patients.
In Aim 1 we will establish that LMK235 and TSA specifically target KRAS/KEAP1 co-mutant and not single mutant
NSCLC cells. We will determine how RB is activated by LMK235 and confirm its role. The role of BIM and BIM
acetylation will also be determined by creating mutants of BIM that either block or inhibit acetylation and testing
their effect in cell responses to LMK235. In Aim 2 we will examine the combined effects of AMG510 and LMK235.
First, we will establish that the combination of AMG510+LMK235 specifically targets KRASG12C/KEAP1 co-
mutant cells. This will be done by comparing sensitivity in a panel of NSCLC cell lines that vary in KRASG12C
and KEAP1 status, and by generating cell lines where KRASG12C and/or KEAP1 are mutated. Lastly we will
test the response of KRASG12C/KEAP1 double or single mutant tumors to AMG510+LMK235 in mice.
The impact and significance of the proposed studies is high. KRAS/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLCs are difficult to
treat. The current grant identifies HDAC4/5 as a targetable vulnerability in these cancers. LMK235 induces
toxicity uniquely in KRAS/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLCs but not single muant NSCLCs, and therefore could be a
way to target these double mutant cancers. The grant is also clinically relevant, as KRASG12C/KEAP1 mutant
NSCLCs responded less well to the G12C inhibitor AMG510 in clinical studies than KRASG12C tumors with
wild-type KEAP1. The grant shows LMK235 in combination with AMG510 causes striking synergistic killing
specifically in KRAS/KEAP1 co-mutant NSCLC. Thus, combination of AMG510 with LMK235 (or compounds like
it) could be used to improve responses in these patients."
10989210,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mounting an effective antibody and cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is critical for its
efficacy to reduce the risk of severe complications and death in COVID-19. Patients with multiple sclerosis
(pwMS) are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and can have altered immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
vaccination. In addition, the type of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) further increases the risk for
breakthrough COVID-19 infection and risk for severe COVID-19 and death in pwMS. For example, while anti-
CD20 monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD20 mAbs) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (S1PMs)
both decrease antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in adult pwMS, the patient’s SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell
responses are blunted in S1PMs but not anti-CD20 mAbs. Although much is known about adult pwMS, limited
data is available on vaccine responses in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) on similar therapies.
Vulnerable and understudied, children have different immune systems than adults and can mount different
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 immunization. Here, we propose investigating how different
immunotherapies (anti-CD20 mAbs vs. S1PM) affect vaccine response in pwMS across age. We will use our
new multiparameter technology, flowBEAT, to measure the type (IgM, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgA1, IgA2, IgE)
and specificity (22 antigens, including structural and non-structural SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV proteins, and a
panel to detect autoantibodies associated with COVID-19 severity) of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2
vaccination and their ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with pseudovirus neutralization assays
(Aim 1). We will also characterize the phenotype and function of the patient’s SARS-CoV-2-specific B-cell and
T-cell subsets using Hi-D flow and mass cytometry (Aim 2). Characterizing the SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral
(antibodies) and cellular (memory B and T cell) responses after vaccination will determine whether the different
immunotherapy regimens, anti-CD20 mAbs vs. S1PMs, can affect the development of a protective vaccine
response, including robust neutralizing antibodies in pwMS across age. Our preliminary data suggest deficient
IgG1 responses in POMS on S1PM but not on anti-CD20 mAbs. Thus, we hypothesize that the immunotherapy
type (anti-CD20 mAbs vs. S1PM) will predict the quality of the memory B- and T-cell responses, including
alterations in neutralizing antibodies, and that this protective immune response will depend on age. We expect
this work to inform therapeutic decisions prescribed to vulnerable MS patients and guide future vaccine strategies
to maximize vaccine efficacy in other patients on similar immunotherapies."

The main goal of this research project is to test and validate a mobile health (mHealth) application to quantify
upper limb motor performance in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy (HCP). Movement impairments
impact activities of daily living and performance of functional activities, thus limiting children’s participation and
quality of life. Rigorous and quantifiable assessments provide key data for treatment planning and offer insight
into the pathophysiology of motor impairments. Clinical assessments of the upper-limb can be subjective,
require in-person visits with trained personnel, and specialized equipment. Alternatively, laboratory
assessments are quantifiable and precise but also require in-person visits with specialized equipment. Existing
mobile technology, such as the iPad tablet, offers the potential for objective and quantifiable measurement in
any environment. As a first step in this research, we will test the reliability, validity, and usability of a mobile
health (mHealth) application to measure upper limb movement performance in a controlled-laboratory setting.
Our team has developed an mHealth application for the iPad featuring interactive games to quantify upper-limb
movement performance. Children with HCP and typically-developing age-matched children will participate in
the study consisting of two in-person visits to a laboratory. During each session, they will play five mHealth
movement games requiring visually-guided multi-joint movements, fine motor and finger control, and bimanual
coordination. In Aim 1, we will determine the reliability, validity, and usability of the mHealth application. Test-
retest reliability and concurrent validity with 3D optical motion capture will be evaluated; usability will be
evaluated with a standardized mHealth questionnaire. In Aim 2, we will further examine the validity of the
mHealth application by comparing motor performance outcomes with other standardized assessments and
questionnaires of the upper-limb that span multiple ICF domains (body function, activity, and participation). If
successful, mobile technology may be implemented in a follow-up cohort study to study longitudinal upper-limb
motor development, recovery, and response to neurorehabilitation interventions in children with HCP. More
broadly, the outcomes of this research will impact how and where motor evaluations can be performed, offering
a flexible methodology for researchers performing longitudinal and telerehabilitation studies. Importantly,
mobile technology offers an option for remote participation that may significantly expand the participant pool,
allowing for more diverse and representative samples in future work."

The legalization of recreational and medicinal cannabis in several states across the US has increased the need
to better understand its effects on the body, brain, and behaviors in diverse populations. Notably, people 50 and
over are the fastest growing group of cannabis users in the US. Among this group are women who have
undergone the transition to reproductive senescence, known as menopause, which occurs at the average age
of 51. Menopause and the attending decrease in circulating estrogens is associated with a variety of symptoms
including mood, anxiety, and cognitive impairments as well as metabolic changes that are linked to poor health
outcomes. As an increasing number of post-menopausal women use cannabis, either recreationally or
medicinally to treat menopause symptoms, it will be important to evaluate the health risks and benefits of
cannabis use in this unique population. Here, preclinical mouse models are particularly valuable, as they provide
precise control over cannabis treatment (composition, frequency etc.) and enable researchers to dissociate the
contribution of age and endocrine status to various neural, behavioral, and metabolic outcomes. To produce
readily translatable findings from mice to humans, preclinical models should closely resemble human patterns
of cannabis consumption. To this end, along with co-I Dr. Ryan McLaughlin, the Delevich lab has recently
validated a novel vapor inhalation model of whole plant cannabis extract for use in mice. Thus, the objective of
this R21 proposal is to utilize this model of cannabis use to model the consequences of chronic cannabis use in
the post-menopausal state. To this end, in Aim 1A we will first establish the pharmacokinetics of vaporized
cannabis in young adult (postnatal day 90) and aged (18 month) female mice who differ by endocrine status
(ovarian intact vs. ovariectomized). Next, in Aim 1B we will assess the effect of chronic cannabis vapor exposure
on energy balance, including weight gain, body composition, food intake, and home cage locomotor activity, in
these same groups. In Aim 2A we will examine how chronic cannabis vapor exposure influences mood-related
endpoints and cognitive flexibility in young vs. aged OVX and ovarian intact female mice. Finally, given the co-
expression of estrogen receptors and endocannabinoid system components within the medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC), and this region’s function in mood regulation and cognitive flexibility, in Aim 2B we will assess the effect
of chronic cannabis vapor exposure on glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission onto layer II/III and
V pyramidal neurons within the prelimbic subregion of the mPFC in young vs. aged OVX and ovarian intact mice.
Together, these aims employ a conceptually and technically innovative approach to study the brain, body, and
behavioral effects of chronic cannabis use in a vastly understudied population. Funding this R21 proposal will
establish the vaporized cannabis exposure model within a mouse model of menopause and generate necessary
pilot data to support future collaborative proposals to investigate the impact of cannabis use on women’s health
during aging."
10920477,"An estimated 250 million or 43% of children under age 5 years are failing to reach their developmental potential in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Parenting interventions, or programs that primarily focus on enhancing the quality of parent-child relationships, have shown effectiveness for improving early child development (ECD) outcomes. However, the majority of evidence-based parenting interventions to date have been designed for, delivered to, and evaluated among mothers and have excluded fathers. Observational studies in high-income countries have supported that fathers’ parenting and couple’s relationships are unique dimensions of fatherhood that independently and interactively shape the influence of fathers on young children’s development. While there is increasing cross-cultural evidence to support these dimensions of fatherhood in LMICs, very little is known about how to engage fathers and address these important aspects of fatherhood through parenting interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. The goal of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to prepare the candidate for a successful transition to an independent intervention scientist with an international research focus on promoting ECD outcomes by supporting fathers through community-based interventions in LMICs. The goal will be accomplished through training during the mentored phase (K99) to broaden the candidate’s knowledge and skills in three critical areas: 1) multidisciplinary and cross-cultural training in ECD, fatherhood, and family science, 2) latent profile analysis, and 3) intervention development and evaluation science. The candidate has assembled an outstanding mentorship team with complementary expertise in theoretical, substantive, and methodological skills. These training objectives will be achieved through a holistic approach that includes regular mentorship meetings, coursework, trainings, conferences, and field-based research experience in Tanzania. The specific research aims of the K99 phase are to: 1) characterize profiles of fatherhood based on measures of fathers’ parenting and couple’s relationships, and determine their associations with later ECD outcomes, and 2) integrate and adapt a multicomponent parenting intervention that supports fathers’ roles as parents and partners in the Tanzanian cultural context. The mentored training and research findings from the K99 phase will enable the candidate to accomplish the final research aim of the independent phase (R00) that is: 3) to conduct a mixed-methods pilot trial of the newly adapted fatherhood intervention for improving paternal outcomes. This proposal will generate the first evidence-based, multicomponent parenting intervention that is designed from the outset for fathers in the Tanzanian cultural context. The pilot trial results will be used to determine program feasibility and acceptability and initial intervention efficacy on paternal outcomes to support a subsequent R01 application that aims to evaluate its effectiveness on ECD outcomes with a larger sample in Tanzania."
10927445,"Anhedonia - the inability to seek-out and experience pleasure - is a common symptom in depression that
predicts treatment resistance and is sometimes exacerbated by first-line antidepressants. Anhedonia falls
within the ""Positive Valence System"" of the Research Domain Criteria framework that comprises two
primary components: ""liking"" and ""wanting."" The ""liking,"" or consummatory, component reflects the
evaluation of rewards reliant on the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. The ""wanting,"" or
anticipatory, component modulates the degree to which effort is expended in goal-directed behavior reliant
on the lateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. Previous research found decreased neural activity in
both of these neural circuits in depressed patients with anhedonia but has not causally investigated the
role of these neural circuits, or their temporal dynamics, in different components of reward-based
decision-making. The preliminary data found decreased goal-directed behavior in depressed patients with
anhedonia and reduced cross-frequency coupling between the phase of delta oscillations (2-4 Hz) in
lateral prefrontal cortex and task-modulated beta oscillations (15-30 Hz) ( delta-beta coupling). The
objective of this research plan is to dissect the causal role of frontal-striatal circuity in different components
of reward-based decision-making and their impairment in anhedonia. The central hypothesis is that
anhedonia arises from decreased goal-directed behavior and disruption of delta-beta coupling in lateral
prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum. The rationale is that spatially and temporally-targeted non-invasive
brain stimulation during performance of a reward-based decision-making task will provide causal evidence
for which network dynamics are impaired in anhedonia. In the K99 phase, this research (1) Causally
dissociated the neural circuits that implement goal-directed behavior and reward-evaluation in
decision-making and (2) Increased goal-directed behavior in depressed patients with anhedonia using
network-targeted non-invasive brain stimulation. Now, the R00 phase will (3) Investigate target
engagement of delta-beta coupling in a potential treatment paradigm with network-targeted stimulation in a
randomized clinical trial for depressed patients with symptoms of anhedonia. This proposal is significant
because it causally evaluates mechanistic models of the networks and cognitive processes that are
disrupted in anhedonia. The work is innovative because it uses concurrent neurophysiology and neurostimulation, integrates high-resolution spatial and temporal investigation tools, and utilizes individualized stimulation parameters such as subcortical-targeting with functional-connectivity and task-specific frequency targeting. The positive impact of this proposal is a refined definition of anhedonia based in biological mechanism that may have transdiagnostic relevance for other psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and substance use disorder. The implication of this proposal is that the knowledge gained can be directly used for the development of novel interventions using precision medicine."

Fibroproliferative illnesses leading to organ fibrosis and failure are responsible for approximately 45% of deaths
in developed countries. Whether idiopathic, triggered by environmental factors, infections, or genetics, organ
fibrosis results in significant morbidity and mortality. Organ fibrosis is responsible for health care costs exceeding
$10 billion/year. It is estimated that the number of deaths due to fibrosis is double the number of deaths due to
cancer, and that organ fibrosis results in significant physical, emotional, and financial burdens. Specifically, lung
fibrosis can be idiopathic, associated with connective tissue diseases, or triggered by environmental and
occupational exposures such as radiotherapy. There are currently no effective therapies to treat existing lung
fibrosis as recently approved drugs merely reduce disease progression and result in significant side effects.
Thus, the only curative option for patients is organ transplantation, which is impossible at the scale needed. We
have identified peptides derived from collagen XVIII which exert anti-fibrotic effects in murine and human pre-
clinical models of lung fibrosis. The beneficial effects include reducing fibrosis in lung tissues of patients with
pulmonary fibrosis who underwent lung transplantation and thus have end-stage severe fibrosis, an effect not
seen with other drugs that are approved or being evaluated for these illnesses. We propose to simultaneous test
the identified peptides in our pre-clinical models of fibrosis and identify a lead candidate. We also propose to
further characterize the efficacy of the lead candidate, conduct dose escalation studies, and optimize the dosing
regimen. We have assembled a unique team with the expertise to develop the lead peptide. Our team includes
an accelerator partner. Successful completion of this project will support our long-term goal of translating our
findings to the clinic and provide patients with pulmonary fibrosis with an effective therapy. Our approach is likely
to have broad impact and relevance for fibrosis in different organs."
10992870,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease of blocked differentiation in which blasts fail to mature
and proliferate continuously. Differentiation therapy, which aims to reactivate latent maturation
programs and induce cell cycle exit, is curative in the promyelocytic (APL) AML subtype, but not in
other AML subtypes. Epigenetic factors help sustain the differentiation block, and inhibitors of
regulators such as the LSD1, BRD4, and DOT1L has recently been shown to re-activate myeloid
differentiation programs in selected AML models. However, these inhibitors generally do not achieve
terminal differentiation and disease remission. Accordingly, there is significant need to identify more
regulators of the AML differentiation block and to test whether their inhibitors can induce terminal
differentiation when used individually or in combination regiments. To identify novel regulators of AML
differentiation, we recently performed a chromatin-focused CRISPR sgRNA screen using gain-of-
differentiation as a readout. This screen identified the H3K9 histone acetyltransferase KAT6A as a
key driver of AML differentiation arrest, and mechanistic work showed that KAT6A and the H3K9ac
histone binding protein ENL closely cooperate to active promoters of AML oncogenes. We confirmed
that both genetic (CRISPR) and small molecule inhibition of KAT6A markedly induces differentiation
and reduces proliferation most commonly in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AMLs, and also in selected
MLL-wild type (MLL-WT) AMLs. Further, KAT6A inhibitors synergize with inhibitors of either LSD1 or
DOT1L to induce near-terminal differentiation and fully halt proliferation in vitro. This proposal has
three goals: First, we will determine the mechanisms by which KAT6A and ENL are recruited to
chromatin and activate transcription. We will identify the protein domains in KAT6A and the MOZ
complex it resides in that are responsible for its binding to chromatin at MLL-AF9 targets and non-
MLL-AF9 targets. We will also identify any transcription factors interacting with KAT6A and ENL and
test their effect on recruitment of the KAT6A-ENL module to chromatin. Our second goal is to test the
therapeutic potential of targeting KAT6A, individually or in combination with LSD1 or DOT1L
inhibitors, in genetically-defined AML mouse models. We will employ an Mll-Af9 model and a
Dnm3a/Flt3-ITD model and test the effect of inhibitor treatment schemes on disease progression and
overall survival. We will also test the effect of inhibitor treatments on normal hematopoiesis. Our third
goal will be to test the response of clinical AML patient samples to inhibition of KAT6A, individually or
in combination with LSD1 or DOT1L inhibitors. We will perform drug response assays in MLL-r and
MLL-WT samples in vitro using OP9 feeder layer culturing methodology, and will also perform PDX
transplant models and test the response to KAT6A and LSD1 or DOT1L inhibitors in vivo."
10993393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To maintain health, the host must avoid generating inflammatory responses to beneficial gut bacteria, while
retaining the ability to respond to pathogens. Maintaining this balance is particularly complicated in early life as
many of the mechanisms that serve to promote tolerance to resident commensal microbes in adults are either
absent or not yet established during this period. We recently identified maternal antibodies as key regulators of
host-microbiota mutualism in neonates. Specifically, we found that in addition to IgA, healthy mothers generate
microbiota-reactive IgG antibodies, which are transmitted via breastmilk and coat bacteria in the neonatal gut. In
comparison with control offspring, neonates that do not receive these maternal isotypes harbor increased
numbers of commensal bacteria in gut draining lymph nodes, mount inappropriate, microbiota-driven CD4 T-
dependent immune responses, and suffer increased morbidity when subjected to a chemical form of colitis.
Building from these exciting findings, this proposal seeks to understand the mechanisms by which maternal
antibodies regulate nascent host-microbiota interactions in neonates. Specifically, we will determine the antigen
specificities and the effector mechanisms (e.g., complement activation or Fc receptor ligation) required for
distinct maternal IgG isotypes to restrain neonatal adaptive immune responses to beneficial gut bacteria.
Additionally, we will define the signaling pathways and cell types required to trigger dysregulated adaptive
immune responses in offspring that do not receive breastmilk antibodies. We will employ innovative approaches
to achieve these goals by leveraging fostering and optimized infant feeding approaches with transgenic mouse
models and multi-parameter flow cytometry. These studies are significant because they address key gaps in our
knowledge regarding how favorable relationships between the host and resident microbiota are established in
early life. Additionally, our work will also advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which breastfeeding
promotes health. We expect that the insight gained from this research will significantly aid in our ability to
manipulate host-microbiota interactions and mucosal immunity during early life, regardless of mode of nutrition."
10993512,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dental settings have been plagued with persistent no-show rates that are associated with low quality of care,
inadequate care access, and inefficient use of organizational resources for the patients and organizations that
need them most. Patient appointment no-shows are particularly pronounced in organizations that service
underserved populations. Studies documenting strategies to reduce no-shows in dental settings are limited,
with organizations reporting difficulty in replicating the findings, particularly in diverse patient populations. In
this study, a team of researchers from the Marquette University School of Dentistry and the Center for Health
Enhancement Systems Studies (the Center) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison College of Engineering
will test the effectiveness of three no-show reduction strategies using an innovative full factorial design that
allows for the simultaneous testing of different combinations of the no-show strategies. The intervention
strategies include a) using Motivational Interviewing techniques when scheduling appointments, b) conducting
reminder calls 24 and 48 hours before an appointment, and c) applying open-access scheduling, along with
other practices found to reduce no-shows in other sectors of health. The practices to test emerged from a pilot
conducted by the study team with dental clinics that primarily serve underserved populations. A significant
aspect of this study is the use of the NIATx Organizational Change Model (the NIATx model) to facilitate and
provide a standardized evidence-based strategy for no-show practice implementation and to address the
concern of the inability to apply proven no-show strategies. The UG3 will require a full two years to finalize the
study protocol and operations manual and formalize partnerships with 40 dental clinics. The UH3 will test if
different combinations of the no-show strategies of Motivational Interviewing, reminder calls, and scheduling
practices can improve no-show rates compared to treatment as usual (Aim 1). A mediational analysis will
examine whether using the NIATx model with fidelity and Organizational Readiness for Change mediates no-
show rates (Aim 2). The qualitative portion of the study will aid in interpretation of quantitative results and will
be used to gain a more in-depth understanding of the factors that promote or impede the implementation of the
no-show strategies (Aim 3). This trial will be among the first RCTs to test a combination of no-show strategies
in health care that is focused on the underserved populations where no-shows are most pronounced and have
the greatest adverse clinical consequences. The investigative team has successfully conducted a pilot study
on this subject and has considerable experience with large clinical trials. In summary, the study intends to
provide an evidence-based replicable approach to reduce no-show rates, with the goal of helping the dental
care field make organizational changes that support evidence-based care and improve care access."
10993867,"PROJECT SUMMARY (unchanged from Parent R37)
Metastasis causes >90% of cancer death. The persistence and lethality of metastasis is driven by cells capable
of self-renewal, slow cell-cycling, tumor re-initiation, and therapy resistance, termed metastasis stem cells
(MetSCs). Development of effective strategies for eliminating metastatis requires a better understanding of the
mechanisms that MetSCs exploit for survival. We recently demonstrated that (1) disseminating colorectal
cancers (CRC) undergo a dynamic phenotypic switch from an LGR5+ tumor-initiating cancer stem cell (CSC)
state to a distinct LGR5lowL1CAM+ state required for metastasis. (2) L1CAM+ MetSCs are functionally distinct
from intestinal tumor-initiating LGR5+ CSCs: L1CAM is required for organoid formation, the regeneration of
intestinal epithelium after colitis, and tumor formation after metastatic dissemination. But unlike LGR5, it is
dispensable for epithelial homeostasis or intestinal tumor initiation. In contrast to tumor initiation, where
homeostatic stem cells undergo oncogene-driven hyper proliferation in intact tissues, metastasis subverts a
regenerative mechanism to survive and regrow outside an intact epithelial niche. (3) We have shown that the
principal driver of L1CAM expression is loss of epithelial integrity itself, acting via loss of E-cadherin intercellular
adherens junctions to transiently displace the transcriptional silencer REST/NSRF from chromatin in quiescent
MetSCs, in turn derepressing expression of L1CAM and other genes required for tissue regeneration1.
Proliferation, restoration of epithelial structures, and macrometastatic outgrowth, on the other hand, require high
REST levels. Our evidence suggests that MetSCs cells are regenerative stem cells that emerge directly in
response to loss of epithelial integrity to drive repair, a phenotype of physiological wound healing that is
redeployed in MetSCs. Molecular mechanism by which REST chromatin binding is dynamically regulated in
MetSCs, and how this in turn enables cell fate plasticity from stemness to proliferation, is unknown. In neurons,
ZFP36L1/2, members of the tristetraproline family of CCCH RNA binding proteins, have been shown to bind to
AU-rich elements in the REST 3’UTR and target REST mRNA for degradation2. ZFP36L1/2 are required for self-
renewal of early burst forming unit erythroid progenitors3, and for maintenance of quiescence in lymphocytes
and muscle progenitors4. Project hypothesis: The ZFP36L1/2-REST axis is a master regulator of cell fate
plasticity in intestinal epithelial progenitors, with loss of ZFP36L1/2 function impairing progenitor self-renewal
and metastatic seeding, but in turn promoting proliferation. Aim 1: Define the function of the ZFP36L1/2-REST
axis in normal and neoplastic intestinal stem cell self renewal, differentiation, and proliferation. Aim 2: Dissect
the molecular mechanism of ZFP36L1/2-mediated cell fate plasticity. Aim 3: Determine the functional
consequences of ZFP36L1/2-REST dynamic regulation in metastatic seeding and colonization. Results will
define mechanisms of cancer progression and identify putative therapeutic targets to limit regenerative plasticity,
with potential to impact clinical outcomes."

Given the complex socio-structural barriers that PWID face, models of care need to shift from disease-centric
models to status-neutral person-centric approaches that address non-HIV issues in addition to HIV services.
Yet, few such models exist to date and of those that do exist, there has been little to no evaluation of their
impact – including indirect effects on other risk groups and/or geographies. India is home to ~800,000 PWID,
with HIV prevalence >20% in many cities. HIV incidence among PWID in New Delhi is 21.3 per 100 PY and
less than 10 percent of PWID living with HIV are virologically suppressed. Additionally, a significant proportion
of PWID in New Delhi report same-sex or opposite-sex partnerships and the majority report migrating to Delhi
for work. Understanding these connections could help identify direct and indirect impacts this intense epidemic
(and mitigation efforts) have on PWID in New Delhi and other populations and/or geographies or vice-versa. A
status-neutral, person-centric clinic (the Blue Shed as referred to by the community) is being established at the
venue that appears to be driving HIV transmission in New Delhi (opening March 2023). Our team is uniquely
situated to evaluate the direct impact of this spatially-targeted person-centric intervention (Blue Shed) in a
setting with one of the highest HIV incidence rates globally and indirect impacts across PWID networks and
other groups. Our Specific Aims are to: Aim 1: Evaluate the impact of a spatially targeted status-neutral
person-centric intervention on HIV incidence, viral suppression, and mortality among PWID in New Delhi, India;
Aim 1a: Investigate the diffusion of a status-neutral person-centric intervention over networks and spaces; Aim
2: Quantify the overlap of HIV epidemics between PWID in New Delhi and other populations in New Delhi, as
well as PWID across selected Indian cities, to elucidate potential indirect impacts of the Blue Shed intervention;
Aim 2a: Examine the overlap between drug use and sexual networks of PWID through sociometric and
egocentric network-based behavioral data and phylogenetic analysis; Aim 2b: Assess HIV source-sink
dynamics and the geographic extent to which HIV among PWID in New Delhi overflows to PWID in
neighboring states of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Manipur; and Aim 3: Model the direct and
indirect impacts of a status-neutral person-centric intervention on HIV transmission within and beyond New
Delhi alone and with other novel strategies (e.g., LA ART, LA PrEP). We will achieve these aims by 1)
continuing follow-up of our sociometric network cohort of ~2500 PWID in Delhi; 2) establishing biometric
linkages to the Blue Shed; 3) collecting new GPS data on mobility; 4) recruiting a sample of sexual partners of
PWID; 5) leveraging behavioral data and specimens from large serial cross-sectional surveys (from 2013,
2016, 2023) among MSM in New Delhi and PWID in 4 other cities; and 6) whole-genome sequencing on
specimens. Evaluating the impact of this novel Blue Shed intervention in a setting with extremely high
incidence and low engagement in care presents a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to inform policy."
10995515,"ABSTRACT
Many epilepsy syndromes associated with severe, early-onset seizures result from de novo variants in genes
involved in early brain development. Recent studies have also identified somatic variants in focal epilepsy
associated with cortical malformations, including hemimegalencephaly and the more common focal cortical
dysplasia (FCD) type 2. These post-zygotically acquired variants arise during neurogenesis and are therefore
present in only a fraction of cells. Expanding on these early discoveries implicating somatic variants in epilepsy,
we recently identified brain-specific somatic mutations in SLC35A2 in individuals with refractory neocortical
epilepsy. Germline variants in SLC35A2 were previously implicated in a rare X-linked developmental and
epileptic encephalopathy. Our data suggest that somatic variants in SLC35A2 may also be responsible for
approximately 17% of intractable non-lesional focal epilepsy cases. The number of cells harboring a pathogenic
SLC35A2 variant allele appears to correlate with disease severity, and several of the cases have FCD type 1a
(FCD1a) pathology. Pathogenic variants in SLC35A2, both somatic and germline, prevent the Golgi-localized
transporter from moving UDP-Galactose (UDP-Gal) into the Golgi apparatus for use in the formation of essential
galactosylated glycans. There is theoretical, experimental, and observational data suggesting that Gal
supplementation may be able to restore glycosylation to the cell to provide therapeutic benefit. In this study, we
will define the functional consequences of SLC35A2 variants in epilepsy. Given that not all cells carry the variant
allele in the individuals with a somatic SLC35A2 variant, in Aim 1 we seek to use resected human brain tissue
specimens to identify the specific cell types in the brain harboring the variant alleles. This will allow us to
determine which cell types contribute to SLC35A2 epilepsy and whether cell-type-specific burden dictates the
pathological observations. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the effects of the variants on cell-type-specific glycosylation
in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells and mature glutamatergic
neurons, a cell type that we have preliminary data to support involvement in the epileptogenic processes. Since
nearly all patients with an SLC35A2 variant have seizures, and a significant fraction has FCD1a, in Aim 3 we will
also characterize the effects of the variants on individual and neural network activity, neural migration, and
neurodevelopment in both human (e.g., hiPSC-derived neurons, 3-D organoids) and mouse models (e.g., mouse
neural progenitors and in utero electroporation). In Aims 2 and 3, we will assess the effectiveness of Gal to
restore glycosylation and reverse effects on neuronal development or activity. Collectively, these studies will
translate our exciting initial discovery implicating a novel pathway underlying a significant fraction of individuals
suffering from intractable seizures into studies of the role of glycosylation defects underlying localized brain
dysfunction in focal epilepsy. Given that the glycosylation pathway represents a potentially druggable target, this
work may inform precision medicine approaches to the treatment of refractory epilepsy."
10993827,"Summary/Abstract: Ticks are ancient hematophagous arthropods that transmit pathogens of public health
and veterinary importance. During feeding, they disrupt host homeostasis through salivary molecules that
perturb inflammation, blood coagulation and nociception. For more than 100 years, tick saliva has fascinated
researchers with its anti-hemostatic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Over the previous funding
period, we used orthogonal approaches and a cell-centric perspective to better understand the intricate biology
occurring between ticks and their hosts. We uncovered that tick extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry bioactive
molecules and mediate interspecies communication with mammals. We discovered that tick EVs affect
dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs) and promote distinct outcomes of microbial transmission to mammals.
DETCs are a subset of murine γδ T cells located in the skin epidermis that have a critical role in wound healing.
DETCs interact with highly specialized epithelial cells (keratinocytes), which comprise approximately 95% of
the epidermal layer in the skin. Under homeostasis, epidermal cells differentiate and migrate to the skin
surface where they are shed while being replenished at the basal layer or stratum basale. Upon an injury,
wound healing occurs in four stages of tissue repair and replacement: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation,
and remodeling. Unfortunately, the epidermis has been mostly neglected when studying the relationship
between ticks and their mammalian hosts. For the next iteration of this project (R01 competing renewal), we
will investigate the effect of tick EVs on the DETC-keratinocyte dialogue. We will also examine how tick EVs
affect the wound healing function of keratinocytes during feeding. Single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry,
cell sorting, and murine genetics will be used to uncover how DETCs and keratinocytes communicate during
feeding of an ectoparasite. Lineage tracing combined with drug perturbations and allied with sophisticated
intravital imaging techniques will be used to track the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of epidermal
cells. Our central hypothesis states that tick EVs disrupt the dialogue occurring between DETCs and
keratinocytes during feeding altering epidermal wound healing. In Aim #1 of this proposal, we will investigate
the effect of tick EVs on the crosstalk between DETCs and keratinocytes. In Aim #2 of this grant application,
we will ascertain how tick EVs affect epidermal wound healing during a tick bite and microbial transmission.
Collectively, we will provide a distinct biological insight and fill a current gap in knowledge for ectoparasitology
and microbial diseases by describing how ticks affect the epidermal environment during feeding."
10981464,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of most devastating neurodegenerative disorders characterized by
the degeneration of motor neurons, paralysis, and often accompanied by cognitive dementia. In addition to
genetic mutations, the biggest risk factor for ALS is aging. Although dysregulation of apoptosis and
mitochondrial quality control, and impaired autophagy, the fundamental physiological processes crucial for
maintaining cellular homeostasis, have been identified as playing pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of ALS, the
mechanisms underlying the dysregulation of these processes remain elusive. Using the superoxide dismutase
1 mutant (SOD1G93A) mouse model of ALS, our preliminary data intriguingly revealed that knockout of PSAP
(presenilin-associated protein), also known as MTCH1, which was originally identified as a mitochondrial
proapoptotic protein by our group, greatly improved motor function and extended the lifespan of the SOD1G93A
mice. These novel findings led to this proposal to investigate the molecular mechanism whereby PSAP
contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS. Furthermore, our data revealed a significant decrease in the activation
of caspase-3 and the levels of p62-positive inclusion bodies in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice upon PSAP
knockout, implying that PSAP knockout exerts a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting apoptosis and enhancing
autophagic activity. Moreover, our study discovered that PSAP interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel
1 (VDAC1), a protein known to play a crucial role in regulating both apoptosis and autophagy. Additionally, our
study has demonstrated that PSAP interacts with death receptor 6 (DR6), which has been implicated in
transducing the pathogenic effect of toxic factors secreted by astrocytes expressing SOD1G93A. These novel
findings lead to this proposal to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which PSAP contributes to the
pathogenesis of ALS. We hypothesize that PSAP functions as a key molecule to bridge cell surface receptor
DR6 and mitochondrial VDAC1, establishing a distinctive mitochondrial pathway to mediate the toxic effects of
factors released by neighboring cells, such as astrocytes expressing SOD1G93A, leading to neurodegeneration
by dysregulating both apoptosis and autophagy. Using our novel global and motoneuron-specific PSAP-
knockout mouse models, the proposed study will investigate the pathological role of PSAP in ALS, specifically,
focusing on disease-related apoptosis and autophagy in vivo. Moreover, using our newly established novel
PSAP-knockout cell line in motoneuron-like NSC34 cells, we will further elucidate the novel molecular
mechanism underlying the regulatory role of PSAP in apoptosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial quality control
under relevant stress conditions in vitro. The success of the proposed study will yield novel insights into the
molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ALS and lead to the identification of new therapeutic
targets for developing effective treatment strategies against ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders.
Therefore, the proposed study holds significant translational value and high impact in the field of ALS research."
10978735,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 One of the most important functions of innate immune receptors is the recognition of nucleic acids. Two
key DNA binding receptors are the AIM2 (absent in melanoma) inflammasome and the cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP
synthase) protein. AIM2 is a member of the IFN-inducible HIN-200 family which is comprised of an N-terminal
(pyrin) PYD and a C-terminal HIN-200 domain. Upon binding of DNA to the HIN-200 domain, the PYD is released
to interact with the common inflammasome adaptor molecule, ASC (apoptoic speck containing protein with a
CARD). This leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, and the cleavage and maturation of IL-1, IL-
18 and the pyroptotic executioner, gasdermin D (GSDMD). AIM2 mediates inflammasome response to a wide
range of bacterial, viral and self-derived DNA in a sequence-independent but length-dependent fashion. cGAS
is a cytosolic enzyme that synthesizes a cyclic dinucleotide, cGAMP, from ATP and GTP. cGAMP in turn is
recognized by the STING (stimulator of interferon genes) innate immune receptor, leading to the downstream
activation of TBK1, NFB and IRF3 which cumulate in the transcriptional activation of type I interferon and
numerous inflammatory cytokines.
 While much is known about the functional roles of these two molecules, critical knowledge remains
missing. For example, limited information is available on the structure of DNA that is recognized by these
molecules in myeloid cells. New preliminary findings lead us to hypothesize that the secondary structure of
nucleic acids impacts their recognition and likely functional outcomes. Aim 1 will test this hypothesis.
 Another critical knowledge that is understudied centers on the roles of these innate immune receptors in
adaptive immune cells. Innate immune receptors have been primarily studied in myeloid cells, however an
analysis of their expression indicates that many are well expressed by adaptive T and B lymphocytes. We have
recently shown that both AIM2 and STING play prominent and surprising roles in T and B cells. We find that
AIM2 promotes T regulatory (Treg) cells in vitro and in vivo and this is due to the association of AIM2 with the
RACK1 kinase and PP2a phosphatase complex, which then blocks Akt activation. We also unexpectedly found
that STING induces an IL-35/IL-10 phenotype in B cells with markers and functions that are consistent with B
regulatory cells. The relevance of these innate immune receptors in lymphocytes will be the focus of this proposal."
10978736,"Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are one of the leading causes of training and sports related injuries and
contribute to post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Torn ACLs are commonly reconstructed, instead of repaired, utilizing
a tendon graft that is passed through bone tunnels created in the femur and tibia positioned at the native ACL
footprints. Even with advancements in surgical technique and rehabilitation strategies, graft failure and recurrent
knee instability are unfortunate complications. Additionally, rehabilitation following surgery is critical to a
successful outcome, with premature return to activity resulting in an increased risk of graft failure and reinjury.
Consequently, there is an unmet clinical need to improve and expedite treatment of these debilitating injuries, to
get patients back to their active lifestyles while minimizing the risk of graft failure. Recreating the zonal tendon-
to-bone insertion site (i.e., enthesis) is critical to restoring normal function following these injuries. Zonal enthesis
formation involves anchoring collagen fibers, synthesizing proteoglycan-rich fibrocartilage, and mineralizing this
fibrocartilage. The hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is critical to the formation of this zonal insertion during
growth and development by promoting the formation of unmineralized and mineralized fibrocartilage zones of
the enthesis. Recent studies by our group demonstrate that this pathway has a similar role in producing
fibrocartilage within zonal attachments in the bone tunnels following ACL reconstruction. Therefore, our long-
term goal is to develop therapies that leverage this pathway to improve repair outcomes and expedite recovery.
The objective of this proposal is to locally deliver a small molecule Hh signaling agonist to increase the formation
of zonal tendon-to-bone attachments. We will conduct an extensive in vitro release study to test the duration and
bioactivity of SAG released from our innovative BiLDS scaffolds in Aim 1. We will then translate this novel delivery
system to treat NZW rabbits following ACL reconstruction in Aim 2 via localized delivery of the agonist in the
bone tunnels. Our hypothesis is that delivery of the agonist will stimulate the local progenitor cells to proliferate
and then differentiate into fibrochondrocytes in the attachments. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 2, we will assess
the extent of tunnel integration by measuring proliferation of the progenitor pool, zonal attachment formation via
mineralized cryo-histomorphometry, and integration strength via anterior-posterior drawer and uniaxial
mechanical testing. Additionally, we will determine the long-term effects of agonist release on joint health by
measuring changes to the synovium and articular cartilage. Finally, we will use activity monitoring post-surgery
and longitudinal in vivo MRI imaging to track the animal rehabilitation and healing response. Successfully
harnessing the Hh pathway therapeutically could result in a paradigm shift in treatment of these debilitating
injuries and could also more broadly inform future tendon-to-bone healing therapies."
10978305,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Characterizing the inherited basis of plasma
lipids, the strongest risk factor for coronary heart disease, has led to key biological and clinical insights. Large-
scale deep-coverage whole genome sequencing is now feasible and offers the opportunity to characterize full
genomic variation within a given individual. For any one individual, however, the interpretation of genomic
variation is limited by 1) ethnic-specific impacts, 2) prediction of functional impact, particularly for rare, non-
coding variants, and 3) comprehensive interpretation frameworks. The goal of this R01 proposal is to fully
characterize the inherited basis of plasma lipids through a novel ‘trans-omics’ approach – complementing
whole genome sequencing with novel methods, genomic features, and clinical frameworks. In Aim 1, we will
discover novel genomic variation from ~600,000 ethnically-diverse individuals and associate with plasma lipids.
We will complementarily use annotation- and data-driven bioinformatic approaches to identify novel genetic
regions. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of larger genomic features, called structural variants, in the role of
lipids in these individuals. We will develop new methods to characterize their functions and incorporate them
into association frameworks for both common and rare structural variants. We will jointly model the monogenic
and polygenic components for risk of familial hypercholesterolemia. In Aim 3, we derive a comprehensive
whole genome sequence diagnostic test for plasma lipids with a harmonized quantitative framework spanning
variant types and their prevalences. In addition to showing their diagnostic yield for lipid disorders beyond rare
commonly tested coding variants, we will also demonstrate their clinical utility for coronary heart disease risk
prediction beyond standard lipids. Using longitudinal lipids datasets, we will characterize how this whole
genome risk model explains lipid burden and variation phenotypes, including while lipid-lowering medicines are
prescribed or titrated. This work leverages data being generated within the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision
Medicine (TOPMed) program, NIH All of Us Research Program, UK Biobank, and others. We have extensive
expertise in whole genome sequence analysis, statistical genetics, computational genomics, and
cardiovascular medicine. This proposal includes methodological and computational innovations, and builds on
established collaborative relationships between investigators with complementary strengths. Completion of our
aims will yield novel insights to inform prevention, diagnosis, and treatments for coronary heart disease.
Furthermore, we will demonstrate a broad framework for trans-omics analysis to identify causally relevant
genomic variants for both research and clinical genetic applications."
10983102,"In the last two decades, thousands of Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been published.
Increasingly, the findings reported by these studies inform the development of Polygenic Scores (PGS) that can
be used to predict phenotypes and disease risk. The Polygenic Scores Catalog includes more than 3,700 PGS.
However, the overwhelming majority of the PGS were derived using data from Europeans and have poor
predictive performance when used to predict phenotypes of individuals of non-European ancestry.
 Transfer Learning (TL) is a technique by which knowledge gained in one data set is used to improve the
model’s performance in another data set. Our overarching goal is to develop novel TL algorithms to improve the
prediction accuracy of PGS for ancestry groups underrepresented in genomics research.
 To achieve this, we propose three specific aims. Our first Aim is to Develop and Benchmark Novel
Penalized and Bayesian methods for PGS development using Transfer Learning. The first method that we
proposed is a Penalized Regression inducing shrinkage of estimates towards external estimates of SNP effects
(e.g., SNP effects derived from Europeans). We develop coordinate descent algorithms to fit Penalized
Regressions using Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net penalties. The second model we propose is a Bayesian
Regression with a mixture prior that uses external estimates as prior means in a model that can automatically
learn for each SNP whether to transfer knowledge from the exterior estimator or not and the strength of borrowing
information. We present preliminary results (using data from the UK-Biobank and AoU) that demonstrate the
potential of the proposed methods. Our Aim 1 research will deliver efficient open-source software to develop
PGS using TL and extensive benchmarks using data from the UK-Biobank, the All of Us (AoU), and three US
cohorts (the ARIC, REGARDS, and the HCSL/SOL cohorts).
 Recent studies suggest that a sizable fraction of the loss of accuracy (LOA) in cross-ancestry prediction is
attributable to genome differentiation (i.e., between ancestries differences in allele frequencies and Linkage
Disequilibrium). We hypothesize that genome differentiation (and thus the portability of local PGS) varies
substantially over the genome. Therefore, in Aim 2, we propose to Develop and Validate Maps of the Relative
Accuracy (RA) of European-derived PGS when used to predict phenotypes of African Americans and Latinos.
 Finally, Aim 3 focuses on Integrating Relative Accuracy Maps developed in Aim 2 into Transfer Learning
Algorithms that can achieve strong transferring of knowledge for genomic regions that exhibit limited genome
differentiation between populations (i.e., high predicted RA) and weaker TL for regions with low predicted RA.
We propose strategies for this in Penalized and the Bayesian models developed in Aim 1. Further, we also offer
an approach to use the Bayesian model that we will develop in Aim 3 to leverage sex-by-ancestry differences."
10990091,"Despite the substantial declines in HIV transmission achieved over the past decade, the full
benefits of available tools and interventions have yet to be realized in youth. This disparity is in
large part due to the inadequate implementation of efficacious interventions tailored in
partnership with youth. The proposed approach to optimizing intervention implementation is the
integration of data science, implementation science, and the science of engagement into a
Youth Learning Health Community (Y-LHC). Florida is suffering from a severe HIV epidemic,
and ranks second in the number of End the Epidemic jurisdictions (n=7). In Florida, as well as
nationally, emerging adults continue to be overrepresented among new HIV cases in youth. In
North Florida, considered the Deep South, there are 10 counties with high HIV prevalence but
they have much fewer resources and much less research activity than counties in South and
Central Florida. Thus, addressing implementation of evidence-based interventions along the
youth prevention continuum in North Florida is highly significant. Our proposed approach will a
model of translational behavioral science with with community-engaged systems science to
develop a Y-LHC in North Florida using data from OneFlorida+ Data Trust, a clinical research
consortium of 11 health systems in Florida. Aim 1 is to define implementation strategies using
community-engaged system science methods for youth in North Florida (R21 phase). Aim 2 is
to conduct simulations of selected strategies to refine for feasibility and greatest impact (R21
phase) Aim 3 is to conduct proof of concept (POC) study of collaboratively selected strategies
on feasible, pragmatic outcome measures (R33) using a pre-post mixed methods approach with
additional simulations of strategy effect. This project will not only pave the way for multisite
pragmatic trials to address the Diagnose and Prevent pillars of the End the Epidemic initiative
for youth as a key population but will also test a transformative framework for translating
community-engaged systems science into new implementation strategies with pragmatic
outcomes."
10991298,"Background: The number of Veterans living with dementia (VLWD) will increase by 2030 to
nearly 340,000; these VLWD and their caregivers often have complex psychosocial and health
needs. Coordinating this care is complicated by the fact that most VLWD are Medicare-eligible
and therefore use care both through the VA and Medicare. Unfortunately, dual use is often
associated with duplication of services and potentially inappropriate care. In light of these
complexities, VHA Directive 1140.12 from October 2019 mandated that VA facilities establish a
Dementia System of Care to provide person-centered services for these VLWD. Because the
design of dementia care services is left to individual VA facilities, national variation affords a
unique opportunity to learn from particularly successful facilities.
Significance: The proposed study will provide important new knowledge to advance the
HSR&D priorities of long-term care/aging, access to care, and primary care practice. This
knowledge will be achieved by linking patient-level VA data, Medicare claims, and the GECDAC
Residential History File, enacting the VA Office of Research and Development’s Research
Priority of putting VA data to work for Veterans.
Innovation and Impact: This will be the first: (1) comprehensive analysis of non-VA care used
by VLWD, including both Medicare- and VA-reimbursed community care; (2) analysis of dual
use at the VA facility level, which is critical data for operational purposes; and (3) analysis of
dementia care since the VHA Dementia System of Care directive. Finally, we will include the
voice of VLWD and caregivers in both facility interviews and as Stakeholder Panel members.
Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the associations of dual use and continuity of care with the
Veteran-centered outcome of home time and how home time varies across VA facilities. (2)
Assess facility-level strategies that promote home time and the acceptability of these strategies
to Veterans and caregivers. (3) Develop a toolkit of dementia care strategies that facilities can
use to enhance VLWD care delivery.
Methodology: In this explanatory sequential mixed methods study, we will first identify
community-dwelling VLWD and link their VA data and Medicare claims with the GECDAC
Residential History File. Then, we will examine the association of dual use of outpatient and
prescription medications with home time, and whether this is moderated by continuity of care.
We will collapse these findings to examine dual use, continuity of care, and home time at the
facility level. With input from a Stakeholder & Expert Panel, we will identify four high- and four
low-performing VA facilities and conduct semi-structured interviews focused on local dementia
care strategies with VA providers, VLWD-caregiver dyads, and a non-VA community care
coordinator (n=9 interviews per facility). Finally, we will integrate our Aims 1 and 2 findings and,
with Stakeholder & Expert Panel input, develop a dementia care toolkit consisting of strategies
and tools that VA facilities can use to help implement their local Dementia System of Care.
Next Steps/Implementation: The 2019 VHA Directive directing VA facilities to establish a local
Dementia System of Care was not optional, but some facilities may have launched their
systems more successfully than others. The toolkit developed during Aim 3 will provide
additional guidance for challenging work facilities are already doing to improve the quality of
care provided to VLWD."

The F99 portion of this proposal investigates the role of the brain enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 in melanoma
progression. The K00 portion of this proposal investigates the interface of tumors and neurons, and how this
interface influences cancer progression. Tumors are composed of multiple cell types and heterogenous cancer
cells. Cellular heterogeneity may be attributed to the dedifferentiation of cancerous cells, where characteristics of
their differentiated states are lost, and new ones acquired. Melanoma, a cancer of melanocytes, cells derived from
the neural crest, has been suggested to have undergone dedifferentiation. Interestingly, the brain-enriched E3
ubiquitin ligase TRIM9 is highly expressed in aggressive melanoma patient samples and multiple melanoma cell
lines. Intriguingly, neurons, which also express TRIM9, are also derived from the neural crest. The Gupton lab
identified TRIM9 as a potent regulator of exocytosis, actin dynamics, and directed axon navigation in developing
neurons. The lab found that TRIM9 negatively regulates the actin polymerase VASP via non-degradative
ubiquitination and negatively regulates exocytosis by preventing SNARE complex formation. My preliminary data
suggest that TRIM9 modulates focal adhesion morphology and number, cell size, random migration, directed
migration in response to extracellular stiffness, proliferation, and protease secretion in melanoma. In addition,
preliminary TRIM9 immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry experiments identified several potential protein
interactors that regulate focal adhesion dynamics, cell cycle progression, and trafficking in melanoma. The goal
of this predoctoral training proposal is to define the role of TRIM9 in focal adhesion dynamics, migration, and
exocytosis in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo in melanoma. I will use a combination of cell and
molecular biology techniques, biochemistry, microscopy, and a mouse model of melanoma. The interaction
between cancerous cells and other cells in the tumor microenvironment has been suggested to influence tumor
progression. In patients, innervated tumors are correlated with morbidity. In addition, neuronal activity in small cell
lung cancer tumors increases proliferation and metastasis in mice. Although progress has been made in
delineating the mechanisms that underly cancer- nerve interactions resulting in increased tumorigenesis and poor
prognosis, there is much yet to understand. The postdoctoral training proposal aims to identify mechanisms by
which the reciprocal interactions between neurons and cancer cells increase tumor progression. To identify
mechanisms, I will use cellular and molecular biology techniques, biochemistry, and MS assays, gained in the
F99 phase, in combination with neuroscience techniques, which I will gain in the K00 phase. Together, the
predoctoral and postdoctoral work aim to answer how cellular phenotypes and cancer progression are affected
by either gaining the expression of a brain- enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase or interactions between neurons and
cancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment."
10990317,"Project Summary
 Over 4,000 patients receive life-saving lung transplants every year. Unfortunately, chronic respiratory
infection frequently complicates these cases and undermines the long-term benefits of this procedure. However,
it can be difficult to identify infections early or to distinguish them from rejection. Unfortunately, the current
diagnostic gold standard, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid culture, is invasive and impractical. We need better,
non-invasive ways to diagnose lung infections.
 One novel but currently insufficient technology that could be developed for this purpose is Next Generation
Sequencing of circulating free DNA (cfDNA). These degraded DNA fragments are released by human cells, and
mirobes into blood plasma. High-throughput sequencing of cfDNA from blood samples is easy, non-invasive,
and has already transformed diagnostics in many areas of medicine.
There is great interest in using microbial cfDNA to diagnose infections. Unfortunately, microbial cfDNA
protocols cannot distinguish between pathogens and closely related organisms that frequently colonize the lungs
of lung transplant recipients. Consequently, microbial cfDNA is not widely used to diagnose infections.
 We have identified a novel approach for identifying microbial pathogens using phages – viral parasites of
bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. Because phages are exquisitely specific to their particular host species and
strain, they can provide insights into microbial population dynamics at the strain level. In particular, we find that
when a particular microbial strain causes infection, phages unique to that strain explode in abundance in
peripheral blood. These data suggest that phages can be used to identify their bacterial hosts.
 Further, we find that the circulating phages are a window into the lung. In paired samples of plasma and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, circulating phages closely mirror the composition of respiratory flora. We
envision that phages in plasma could be used to monitor patients for infections.
It may also be possible to use phages to distinguish between infection and allograft rejection. Donor-derived
cell-free DNA fragments (dd-cfDNA), released by damaged allograft tissues, are a sensitive but not specific
biomarker for rejection. We postulate that phages might add to this specificity by helping to rule out infection.
 Our hypothesis is that circulating phages reflect microbial strain dynamics in the lung and can be used to
identify infections and rejection in lung transplant recipients. To test this, in Aim 1 we will develop protocols for
identifying phages associated with respiratory pathogens and AMR strains. Then, in Aim 2 we will define the
circulating phageome and its relationship to respiratory flora in lung transplant recipients. Finally, in Aim 3 we
will determine whether phages can retrospectively diagnose infections and distinguish these from rejection.
 Together, these bold studies will provide unprecedented insights into the bacterial flora of the lung as well as
help fulfill the unrealized potential of cfDNA in infectious diseases."
10990951,"Program Summary/Abstract
Immunotherapies including adoptive cell therapy (ACT) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) represent
powerful approaches in combating cancer. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are a cornerstone of cancer
immunity and exhibit inherent heterogeneity, with precursor exhausted T (Tpex) but not exhausted T (Tex) cells
responding to immunotherapies. However, poor functional and proliferative capacity of CTLs in the tumor
microenvironment limit immunotherapeutic efficacy. Further, whether and how Tex cells, which retain limited
cytolytic activity against tumors, can be reprogrammed to reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity remains largely
unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need to systemically interrogate the regulatory circuitry underlying CTL
differentiation to unleash the full immunotherapeutic potentials. Through single-cell CRISPR (scCRISPR)
screens of CD8+ T cells in vivo, we discovered two transcriptional axes, Rbpj–Irf1 and Ets1–Batf, that impinge
upon CTL differentiation states and metabolic activities. Targeting Rbpj inhibits transitory Tex (Tex1) to terminal
Tex (Tex2) cell differentiation, while targeting Ets1 promotes Tpex to transitory Tex (Tex1) cell differentiation.
Accordingly, targeting Rbpj or Ets1 enriches Tex1 cells, associated with enhanced metabolic activities, and
shows strong therapeutic efficacy in multiple murine tumor models. Low RBPJ or ETS1 expression strongly
correlates with the immunotherapeutic response in human patients with cancer, further supporting the
therapeutic relevance. Our central hypothesis is that CTL differentiation is marked by transcriptional and
metabolic heterogeneity, the targeting of which enriches Tex1 cells and promotes antitumor immunity.
Our model represents a major advance towards understanding fundamental mechanisms of T cell fate and
immunometabolism and points to new avenues to improve efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Aim 1. Target
mediators of Tex1 to Tex2 terminal differentiation to reinvigorate exhausted T cells. Aim 2. Establish mechanisms
that control T cell metabolism and Tex1 cell generation. Aim 3. Identify combinatorial factors and metabolic
dependence for CTL differentiation. We predict our studies will establish new paradigms in T cell biology and
immuno-oncology, with the discovery of novel checkpoints and actionable targets to reprogram CTL cell fate by
enriching the Tex1 state and rewiring cellular metabolism, thereby opening new avenues to improve cancer
therapies."
10992078,"3D Visualization and Investigation of Retinal Axon Regeneration
Poor regeneration of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons is a major obstacle for treating ocular trauma and optic
neuropathies. There are yet no therapies to repair damaged optic nerve. Our previous studies have
demonstrated that modulation of distinct genes promotes long distance regeneration of some RGC axons in
adult mice. However, promoting axons not only to regenerate into the lesion, but to travel long distances, and to
reconnect with their central targets is still a major challenge. In fact, we and others have reported that only a few
axons reinnervate the brain. It is unclear what cellular and molecular factors contribute to the limited pathfinding,
and the lack of target re-innervation. The overall goal of this proposal is to; i) identify effective approaches that
promote regeneration and reconnection of RGC axons, ii) optimize three dimensional imaging techniques to
examine subtype-specific regeneration, and iii) assess the genes that are regulated by the regenerative-
promoting factors using single nucleus RNA sequencing. Identifying strategies to further increase regeneration
and re-innervation in the brain represents critical future studies. Results obtained from these studies will provide
invaluable information on developing future therapies to repair degenerated optic nerve after trauma or in
diseases."

 Globally, undernutrition contributes to 44% of childhood deaths under the age of five. Stunting, or
reduced linear growth, is a major complication of undernutrition that is associated with increased risk of
metabolic and infectious disease, reduced educational attainment and poor cognitive function later in life.
Stunted mothers are more likely to experience complications during childbirth, and to give birth to stunted
children. In turn, many children that are born stunted do not recover despite current therapeutic interventions.
Therefore, stunting is often referred to as an intergenerational syndrome, and new approaches are desperately
needed to improve childhood growth in vulnerable populations.
 The maternal immune system plays a major role in shaping offspring physical, cognitive and immune
development. The gut microbiota likewise influences both local and systemic immunity, raising the possibility
that the maternal microbiome could influence fetal and childhood development. We hypothesize that maternal
gut microbial composition shapes the fetal immune environment to control offspring growth and
immune development during undernutrition. We propose to use a mouse model of intergenerational
undernutrition to identify specific immune and microbial targets for therapeutic intervention. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that breeding mice colonized with microbiota from healthy or severely stunted donors
produce offspring with divergent weight, bone, and immune developmental phenotypes that persist into
maturity.
 We will use this model to isolate the role of the maternal gut microbiome from the neonatal microbiome,
giving critical insight into the window of potential intervention. We will also identify specific subsets of microbes
that are capable of influencing offspring growth and immune development and characterize microbial metabolic
products associated with these changes. Finally, we will identify maternal immune cells and signaling pathways
that respond to these microbial communities to control healthy growth and immune development in offspring.
These experiments will identify specific microbial species as well as host immune pathways to target
therapeutically, and define the appropriate developmental stage in which to intervene. The Cowardin lab is
located within the Child Health Research Center at the University of Virginia, and as a member of the Trans-
University Microbiome Initiative, is uniquely suited to pursuing these studies. The lab has both the
infrastructure and expertise required for successful completion of these goals. Ultimately, this proposal will lead
to potential probiotic and immunotherapeutic treatments to disrupt the transmission of stunting from mother to
child."
10981534,"ABSTRACT
 TANGO2 Deficiency Disorder is an autosomal recessive disease caused by genetic alterations in
TANGO2 (Transport and Golgi Organization Homolog 2). Patients, primarily young children, with TANGO2
disorder are susceptible to recurring episodes of metabolic crisis and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that
lead to cardiac arrest and death. TDD is associated with a high mortality because TDD-related arrhythmias do
not respond to standard antiarrhythmic therapy. Promising new data from an international patient registry and
natural history study has demonstrated B-vitamin supplementation prevents and may treat arrhythmias but the
mechanism by which they work remain unclear. In addition, despite investigations, the exact functional role of
TANGO2 protein remains unknown. We believe that current therapeutic interventions are ineffective because
we lack an understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms driving TANGO2-related arrhythmia development
and by studying the role of B-vitamins in arrhythmia prevention and treatment will provide answers.
 We propose a study to evaluate vitamin B9, a component of B-vitamins that has shown effective
suppression of ventricular arrhythmias based on preliminary data. This study is a translational study, combining
human patients, cellular and animal models. Specifically, we will utilize TDD patients in an existing natural history
study, Tango2 -/- mouse model, and TANGO2 deficienct induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (iPSC-
CMs) to study the effects of folate on ventricular arrhythmia development and to determine the mechanism
driving ventricular arrhythmias in TDD. Our study will provide clinically relevant data and novel insights into the
pathophysiologic mechanisms driving TDD-arrhythmia development and help improve patient survival and
outcomes in TANGO2 disorder."

Acquired infections after spinal cord injury (SCI) constitute the main cause of death in patients. For those that
survive, acute pneumonia has been associated with significantly reduced neurological recovery. However,
proof of causality and the mechanisms underlying the blunted recovery triggered by infections remain elusive.
To analyze whether pneumonia has a causal and direct effect on the lesioned spinal cord, we expose mice
to a clinically relevant, controlled SCI-associated pneumonia (SCI-AP) embedded into a bed-to-bench
translational approach. Our experimental data demonstrate that contracting pneumonia after subacute SCI
with consecutive intraparenchymal iron deposition extending from the lesion site into spared tissue. Three
aims are proposed to answer one main and novel question: does acute pneumonia exacerbate spinal cord
 -AP-triggered signaling as
causal targets for neuroprotective intervention. Experiments in Aim 1 apply parabiosis models in conjunction
with serum injections to identity circulatory, humoral factors underlying SCI-AP-induced injury/disrepair.
Moreover, tracing bacterial fragments will detect passive shuttling of immunogenic bacterial
material (Bright fluorescent S. pneumoniae) across a breached blood spinal cord barrier to study possible
direct spinal cord lesion-pathogen interactions. Loss of vascular integrity will be detailed to the capillary level
to detect features of capillary fragmentation by using spinal cord tissue clearing, intravascular tracing and
3-D imaging. Aim 2 targets and its underlying IFN-1 signaling via toxic CD11b+,
CD206-- to propagate vascular damage and/or disrepair (STINGflox x LysMcre
mice). Aim 3 captures SCI-AP-induced cell-specific transcriptional changes associated with anti-microbial
immunity, such as myeloid cell-dependent effects on spinal cord endothelium to reveal novel targets for
blocking or reversing SCI-AP-induced injury/disrepair. Clinically, SCI-AP typically emerges around day 2-3
days post SCI when the patient is in the hospital. This offers a more feasible and realistic time window for
protective interventions compared to orthodox neuroprotective strategies which are limited to a short post-
SCI time-window (golden first hour(s)). If successful, data from these experiments will directly inform effective
strategies for SCI patients to i) reduce infection-associated disability and ii) protect outcome at risk."

 Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and along with other optic neuropathies is
characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) management is
the current standard of care for glaucoma patients, but fails to stop the irreversible loss of RGCs and
progressive visual dysfunction. Glaucomatous RGC death was recently found to be driven by reactive optic
nerve head (ONH) astrocytes, suggesting targeting these (and other) glial populations in the retina may be a
viable strategy to protect RGCs. We recently discovered nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of cAMP, dependent
on expression of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), and associated with the stress-induced cell cycle inhibitor
p21Cip, differentially regulate reactive astrocyte proliferation, microglial/macrophage activation, and RGC
survival after traumatic optic nerve injury. Here, using a newly developed and reversible model of glaucoma in
mice, we will establish the molecular, cellular, and transcriptional mechanisms that confer specificity to
neurotoxic and protective astrocyte reactivity regulated by compartmented cAMP, sAC, and p21Cip in ONH
astrocytes and Muller glia. An exciting element of our proposal is the use of state-of-the-art single cell RNA
sequencing and cut-and-tag assays to identify the transcriptional and (epi)genetic changes induced by
compartmented cAMP manipulation, and link those changes to reactive phenotypes in astrocytes and
downstream effects on RGC survival and microglial/macrophage infiltration. All of this will be accomplished
using novel AAV viral vectors to specifically target ONH astrocytes and Muller glia. These experiments will lead
to the discovery of new biological pathways that regulate glial reactivity in neurodegenerative disease, and
serve in the development of gliotheraputics for the treatment of glaucoma and other optic neuropathies."
10978271,"Atherosclerosis, a chronic arterial disease, is markedly accelerated in individuals with diabetes, accounting for
a 2- to 4-fold increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. One of the hallmarks in this process involves
the recruitment and accumulation of intimal macrophages, a process that is more pronounced in diabetes than
without diabetes. The presence of pro-inflammatory macrophages facilitates the progression of atherosclerosis
and impairs the ability of lesions to regress despite optimal medical therapy. Therefore, modulating
monocyte/macrophage chemotaxis and accumulation in the vessel wall may provide a novel therapeutic
approach to limit atherosclerotic progression and facilitate regression.
 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of regulators of epigenetic modifiers, RNA, or
protein-coding genes that has garnered attention for impacting diverse biological processes relevant to
atherosclerosis. However, the identity and roles of specific lncRNAs within atherosclerotic lesions, especially in
diabetes, are not well defined. Using RNA-Seq profiling to identify lncRNAs derived specifically from the
atherosclerotic intima, we identify the lncRNA MERRICAL (Macrophage-Enriched lncRNA Regulates
Inflammation, Chemotaxis, and AtheroscLerosis (MERRICAL). MERRICAL was the highest expressed lncRNA
with a 249% increase concomitant with atherosclerotic progression under a high fat sucrose-containing (HFSC)
diet and decreased with regression after a high cholesterol diet, but not after a HFSC diet. MERRICAL is a
macrophage-enriched and nuclear-specific lncRNA. Our preliminary data demonstrate that delivery of inhibitors
to MERRICAL in LDLR-/- HFSC-fed mice strongly reduced lesion size by 86%, independent of effects on
circulating lipid profile, but rather by decreased macrophage accumulation in lesions. Preliminary studies show
that MERRICAL in-cis regulates its neighboring genes Ccl3 and Ccl4 and macrophage chemotaxis mediated
via interaction with a complex of the histone modifying enzyme H3K4me3. In addition, MERRICAL knockdown
functions in-trans to regulate IL-1b-associated inflammasome signaling. These observations provide the central
hypothesis that MERRICAL deficiency, via regulatory effects on H3K4me3 and macrophage chemokines and
IL-b inflammasome signaling, reduces macrophage chemotaxis, lesional macrophage inflammatory signaling,
and suppresses diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. To address this further, in Aim1 we examine the role of
MERRICAL and the in-cis regulation of CCL3/CCL4 in macrophage chemotaxis and in-trans regulation of IL-
1b-associated inflammatory signaling; in Aim2, we assess how alterations of MERRICAL expression affects
recruitment of lesional macrophages on lesion progression and regression in vivo; and in Aim3, we examine
the role of the MERRICAL-H3K4me3 signaling axis in human cells and atherosclerotic lesions. Our studies will
address a major gap in our understanding of lncRNAs in atherosclerosis and diabetes and inform how
MERRICAL-mediated control of lesional macrophages may provide new targets for therapy."

The overall goal of this grant is to continue supporting the multidisciplinary Scientific Research Network on
Decision Neuroscience and Aging. The integrative emerging area that this grant will support combines the
strengths of several fields including psychology, neuroscience/neurology, medicine and economics to facilitate
rapid scientific progress and directly contribute to the development of effective interventions and policies to
improve health and well being across the life span and reduce the burden of Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD). After ten years of establishing this network, the next five years will be focused on
strengthening the link between basic research on decision making and aging and clinical research on decision
making and ADRD. This will involve growing the network participation to include emerging scientists interested
in ADRD as well as expanding our advisory board to include ADRD experts. Over five years this network grant
will support scientific meetings, intensive training workshops for researchers at all stages, collaboration and
mentorship initiatives, and pilot grant competitions for researchers new to the field. These activities will directly
support the growth, development, and sustainability of the decision neuroscience of aging. This grant will
support growth of the network through dissemination activities. Scientific meetings will increase awareness of
the latest findings with the goal of drawing new researchers into the area and encouraging new collaborations.
A small grant competition will encourage scientists to join the area and will stimulate new research through
small scale pilots. This network grant will support development of the area through methods workshops and an
outside mentorship program. Short, intensive workshops will focus on training researchers at all stages in the
collection and analysis of various emerging behavioral and biological measures and introduce investigators to
new research areas to expand the scope of their own work and build new collaboration opportunities (e.g.,
clinical ADRD science for decision making researchers; decision neuroscience for clinicians). The development
of these skills is currently difficult to achieve in traditional single discipline training programs, but will be
essential for taking advantage of the growing number of large multivariate and multi-level integrative datasets
generated by this type of research, especially prevalent in ADRD research. The network will focus on investing
in the sustainability of this field by ensuring that students, fellows, and faculty are invited to participate in all
activities. Workshops, meetings, small pilot grants, and collaboration initiatives will facilitate the transition from
the current growing group of individuals managing network activities to a strong field of researchers leading
future work in this area. After completion of activities, this emerging area will be in better position for network
members to pursue funding to support the network in the future using more traditional mechanisms."

of platelet physiology. The long-term goal of this line of research is to engineer technologies that can
diagnose the spectrum of bleeding disorders at increased specificity, sensitivity, and throughput than is
currently available. The overall objective of this application is to design elastic hydrogel microparticles as
a platform to measure platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation, and contraction. The rationale for this
project focuses on inherited platelet disorders that are challenging to detect using conventional clinical
assays, or lack a specific diagnosis as in the case of many acquired bleeding disorders associated with
acute or chronic inflammation. We will meet our overall objective with two specific aims: 1) Immobilized
particle assay to measure platelet function kinetics; and 2) Suspended particle assay to measure platelet
function equilibrium. We will synthesize peptide-functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG) particles that
present ligands in a combinatorial manner using microfluidic single and double emulsion approaches. In
Aim 1, the kinetics or speed of platelet adhesion, activation, aggregation, and contraction will be
measured by optical microscopy on immobilized beads in a channel. The equilibrium or strength of these
same platelet subfunctions will be measured in suspension in a well-defined shear flow using a rotational
rheometer. This approach simulates force-dependent platelet function that is regulated by blood flow in
vivo, but with the throughput of a flow cytometer. By creating a platform where each particle serves as an
individual test site and each assay includes thousands of test sites, we aim to improve the reliability and
reproducibility of platelet function testing, as well as identify new patterns of underlying bleeding disorders.
The proposed research is innovative, in our opinion, because it represents the creation of a diagnostic
approach that incorporates four key elements of platelet function—adhesion, aggregation, activation, and
contraction—within a high throughput format via a lab-on-a-particle platform. This contribution will be
significant because it has the potential to improve the lives of people with bleeding disorders by
standardizing diagnostic criteria which is currently undefined."

Dr. Lou is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with a long-term career goal to develop, implement, and
disseminate intelligent clinical decision support interventions that improve the care of surgical patients, with a
current focus on perioperative blood management. Her prior research training has allowed her to develop
expertise in data science and predictive model development using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This
proposal builds on Dr. Lou’s prior experience by providing the protected time, mentorship, and training
necessary to develop skills in the implementation of AI models as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, and in
the evaluation and dissemination of such tools. The proposed career development plan will involve mentorship,
didactic, and practical research training in the conduct of pragmatic clinical trials, the design and evaluation of
implementation strategies for CDS tools, governance for CDS interventions, and foundational training in clinical
research. She has brought together a multi-disciplinary group of mentors and advisors, including Thomas
Kannampallil, PhD, Michael Avidan, MBBCh, and Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA, each of whom have expertise
in clinical trials and the implementation of health technology innovations. Washington University provides the
ideal environment for Dr. Lou’s training given its infrastructure and strengths in informatics, clinical trials, and
implementation science. The proposed research plan provides the framework for Dr. Lou to acquire the skills
she needs to achieve her career goals. Presurgical testing and preparation for surgical transfusion is essential
for patient safety during surgery, yet excessive preparation is costly and contributes to blood product waste.
Given recent blood shortages, presurgical blood orders should be placed only for patients who need it; there is
an acute public health need for tools that accurately estimate the risk of transfusion to guide clinical decision-
making. In preliminary work, Dr. Lou has developed a personalized AI model, named S-PATH, to estimate
surgical transfusion risk, and demonstrated its validity across local and national datasets. The objective of this
proposal is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of S-PATH as a CDS system embedded
within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) using a pragmatic cluster-randomized clinical trial. The expected
outcome is a generalizable, EHR-agnostic personalized CDS system to guide presurgical blood orders that is
feasible to deploy within preoperative workflow. This proposal is significant in its potential to change clinical
practice, with considerable public health impact for patient safety, blood conservation, and reduced healthcare
costs. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Lou with the skills needed to launch an independent
research program to improve the delivery science for AI innovations in healthcare."
10985913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mechanisms underlying sustained weight loss after bariatric surgery remain unclear, though rapid nutrient
delivery is a major candidate driving decreases in caloric intake via the gut-brain axis. Preclinical models have
demonstrated the importance of the gut-brain axis in modulating short- and long-term feeding and taste
preferences through gut-brain neural connections and the endocrine gut peptide response. Our clinical
preliminary data demonstrates that rapid intestinal nutrient infusion (bypassing the stomach) in non-surgical
patients with obesity can mimic the augmented gut-brain endocrine response (e.g. GLP-1) of bariatric surgery.
Our overarching hypothesis is that bariatric surgery induces a chronic state of rapid nutrient delivery leading to
hypersecretion of gut peptides known to signal satiety, slow GI motility, and decrease nutrient-rich food
preference. This sustained and altered enteral delivery modifies nutrient-stimulated, gut endocrine and gut-
brain signaling, which changes feeding behavior and leads to weight loss. In the following project, we will (Aim
1) test the hypothesis that rapid nutrient delivery is associated with augmented GLP-1 and brain fMRI
responses. Human subjects being evaluated for bariatric surgery will undergo non-invasive placement of an
enteral feeding tube for a variable rate glucose infusion into the small intestine, with concurrent measurement
of the rapid brain signaling response using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and gut peptide
endocrine response. Additionally, we will (Aim 2) test the hypothesis that Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) is
associated with faster nutrient absorption compared to Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG). Preoperative and
postoperative measurements of intestinal nutrient uptake will be made with non-metabolizable glucose and
amino acid tracers, with measurement of the corresponding gut peptide endocrine responses to understand
the putative differences in postoperative absorption of sleeve and gastric bypass. This career development
plan is highly innovative, combining enteral nutrient infusion with fMRI to begin to (1) establish rapid intestinal
nutrient delivery as a primary driver of the gut endocrine response of bariatric surgery, (2) determine the
degree to which the most common bariatric operations increase nutrient absorption, and (3) identify brain
regions that are rapidly responsive (within seconds) to enteral nutrient presence similar to preclinical rodent
studies. Understanding gut-brain axis physiology and how it is altered by bariatric surgery may lead to
identification of novel therapeutic strategies and simpler surgical or endoscopic treatments for obesity. The
training plan associated with this career development award allows the PI to gain the necessary training in
patient-oriented research and focuses long-term research efforts in studying the gut-brain axis in obesity and
bariatric surgery."

Dystonia is a disabling neurologic disorder, affecting more than 3 million people worldwide. It is characterized by
involuntary, painful muscle contractions that cause twisting movements leading to abnormal postures. Though
dystonia can affect any region of the body, cervical dystonia (CD) is the most common presentation. CD has
great etiologic heterogeneity, and the vast majority of cases are idiopathic. Identification of potential pathogenic
mechanisms is critical to the development of better diagnostic tools and treatment strategies. With the support
of this K23 award, Laura Scorr, MD, MSc, will define the role of immune mechanisms in CD. She will leverage a
local biobank in combination with brain specimens from the NIH NeuroBioBank, a unique and powerful national
resource for investigators utilizing human post-mortem brain tissue and related biospecimens for their research
to understand conditions of the nervous system. The proposed studies will analyze immune cell frequencies
(Aim 1), delineate indices of altered immune cell function and activation (Aim 2), and compare histopathologic
markers of immune activation in key brain regions implicated in dystonia pathogenesis (Aim 3) in CD as
compared to healthy controls. This research strategy will facilitate a 5-year career development and training plan
enabling Dr. Scorr to build on her background in statistical computing and clinical epidemiology and to gain
critical mentored research training. To achieve independence as a clinical investigator with a unique niche in the
immunology of dystonia, Dr. Scorr requires further training in: 1) neuroimmunology; 2) quantitative
neuroanatomical methods for detection of neuroimmune activity; and 3) bioinformatics and data science for the
identification of pathogenic pathways. To achieve these training aims, Dr. Scorr has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team that includes lead mentor Dr. Hyder A. Jinnah, an expert in the biology of
dystonia, co-mentor Dr. William Tyor, an internationally recognized expert in translational neuroimmunology
research, co-mentor Dr. Jeremy Boss, a world-renowned immunologist, and co-mentor Dr. Yan Sun, an expert
in the analytic methods utilized for the discovery of potential pathogenic pathways. Emory University provides
an exceptional intellectual and collaborative environment for this research. By leveraging existing biobanks at
Emory and through the NIH NeuroBioBank, in combination with the support from her outstanding mentorship
team, Dr. Scorr will be well positioned to carry out the proposed study aims and training plan. In doing so, she
will develop the expertise and preliminary data to be competitive for NIH R01 and other funding using
immunophenotyping, transcriptomic, and neuroanatomical approaches to better understand dystonia biology,
inform clinical care, and the direct development of novel therapeutics."
10985510,"Polysubstance use is the defining characteristic of the fourth wave of the overdose (OD) epidemic. The proposed study will adapt and test a smartphone-based mobile health (mHealth) intervention to reduce OD risk behavior among people who use drugs (PWUD) and engage in polysubstance use. The goal of the research is to establish the efficacy of an OD prevention intervention, based in the principles of harm reduction, that is easily scalable and available to PWUD in urban and rural environments. The proposed study builds on findings from the investigative team’s ongoing study that uses ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods to measure polysubstance use during people’s daily lives in community settings (R01DA049761, PI Lorvick). In this study, we found that PWUD used multiple substances within the same hour in 60% of substance use episodes. In the R61 phase, we will adapt an existing smartphone-based
substance use disorder intervention (Addiction Comprehensive Health Education Support System; A-CHESS) to create OD-CHESS in partnership with PWUD, local harm reduction providers, and the National Harm Reduction Coalition. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of OD-CHESS to establish efficacy. We also will assess the persistence of the intervention, examine patterns of attenuation, and develop an understanding of participants’ experiences with OD-CHESS, all of which will provide valuable information regarding scalability and future deployment of the intervention. The Specific Aims are as follows: R61 Aim 1: Develop the OD-CHESS intervention by adapting the A-CHESS intervention model using the Generative Co-Design Framework. R61 Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study of OD-CHESS to establish
usability and preliminary efficacy. R33 Aim 1: Conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of OD-CHESS. R33 Aim 2: Characterize the persistence of the OD-CHESS intervention effect over a 4- week period. R33 Aim 3: Identify strengths and shortcomings of the OD-CHESS intervention among participants who were assigned to the experimental condition. The proposed research will be conducted in Oakland, California. This study will strive to advance public health by combining the strengths of harm reduction and mHealth in an innovative, scalable approach to addressing the growing problem of polysubstance-related overdose.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."

Cervical cancer is highly preventable with early detection and treatment, but due to lack of accessible early
screening options, incidence and mortality are still very high in low-resource settings (LRS). High-risk human
papillomavirus (hrHPV) is responsible for most cervical cancer cases, and the WHO recommends testing for
hrHPV and preemptively treating all patients who are positive as the primary prevention strategy in LRS. Nearly
all available tests look for hrHPV DNA, which can result in overtreatment because it cannot differentiate infections
that will clear naturally. Detectable hrHPV mRNA, however, is strongly associated with higher grade cervical
precancers, making it a more specific biomarker for cervical cancer risk. This proposal aims to address the need
for more specific early cervical cancer detection technology by developing novel in vitro and in vivo methods for
detecting hrHPV mRNA. In the F99 phase of this proposal, I will develop and pilot a sample-to-answer mRNA
test for HPV16 and HPV18. I will first develop a minimally instrumented method for preparing mRNA for detection
from both provider and self-collected cervical samples. I will then amplify this mRNA using an isothermal assay
that produces a real-time fluorescent signal, which I will read using a low-cost fluorimeter. I will integrate the
individual assay components into a workflow with minimal user steps, making a test that is deployable to LRS. I
will work with my sponsor, Dr. Rebecca Richards-Kortum, an established expert in the field of point-of-care
cancer detection technologies to develop this test. I will then work with my co-sponsor, Dr. Kathleen Schmeler,
the VP of Global Oncology at the UT MD Anderson Cancer Center with extensive experience translating cancer
detection technologies to LRS to pilot this test with clinical samples in both Houston and Brazil. This training plan
will help me gain experience with technology development, scientific communication, and clinical collaborations
both locally and globally, and is enhanced by the location of my training at Rice University in the Texas Medical
Center, where I will have access to world-class equipment, resources, and clinical collaborators. In the K00
phase of this proposal, I will develop a technique for detecting hrHPV mRNA in vivo. This will permit real-time
early cervical cancer detection and monitoring, which can help assess disease progression and inform treatment
faster than repeated in vitro sampling and testing. In the proposed project, I will use a combination of sequence-
specific fluorescent mRNA labeling, aptamer-mediated label delivery, and high-resolution fluorescence imaging
to detect hrHPV mRNA sensitively and specifically in vivo. I will seek a mentor with experience in biomarker label
design and delivery at an institution with robust imaging resources and clinical collaborations. The proposed
work will prepare me for an academic career as a cancer researcher dedicated to improving global access to
early cancer detection. In addition to technical experience, I will develop my scientific communication skills, build
a network of collaborators, and mentor the next generation of cancer researchers, laying the foundation for a
career developing and deploying novel cancer prevention technologies with clinical impact around the world."

Chronic lower respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide.
Currently there are no effective disease-modifying therapies and it remains unclear how to define and
optimally treat disease endotypes within the spectrum of asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; chronic bronchitis and emphysema). This mechanistic research aims to define new pathways
amenable to therapeutic intervention based on the role of diseased airway epithelial cells as an upstream
driver of chronic airway disease. As a foundation for this proposal, multiple human clinical and translational
studies as well as allergen- smoke- and virus-induced animal models have solidified the relevance of the
pathogenic epithelialderived cytokine IL-33 in COPD and asthma. However, a major knowledge gap that
remains is understanding the mechanism by which nuclear-sequestered IL-33 can be activated and secreted
from diseased airway cells to drive inflammation. Here we present preliminary data that demonstrates
human COPD airway epithelial cells express increased levels of a truncated, spliced IL-33 isoform, which is
capable of escaping nuclear sequestration to be abundantly secreted. Our analysis further revealed novel
features of this secreted IL-33 isoform including post-translational modification, interaction with exosome-
associated chaperones, and utilization of exosome trafficking pathways for secretion. Accordingly, this study
aims to elucidate the impact of these newly-discovered features of IL-33 biology on the pathogenesis of
chronic airway disease. Aim 1 will define how IL-33 interaction with exosomal chaperones enhances
cytokine secretion and receptor activation to drive airway disease, using human cellular and mouse airway
disease models coupled with validation in human airway disease specimens. Aim 2 will investigate the role
of post-translational modification in augmenting IL-33 secretion and receptor activation to propagate
disease, through an analogous approach using human cellular and mouse models with validation in human
specimens. Together, these aims will address key steps in the pathologic sequence that initiates and
sustains chronic airway disease, illuminating novel ways to target exosome-mediated cytokine secretion at
the mucosal interface

we have found that human COPD airway epithelial cells produce increased levels of a truncated, spliced IL-
33 isoform that is tonically secreted. Our analysis further revealed this secreted IL-33 isoform is uniquely
phosphorylated through protein kinase C pathways. Recognizing that currently available commercial
antibodies do not specifically recognize alternatively spliced or modified IL-33 isoforms, in this
administrative supplement we aim to develop and validate monoclonal antibodies for detection of this
disease-associated IL-33 variant. Aim 1a will involve immunization of mice with the truncated, spliced IL-33
variant lacking exons 3 and 4 (IL-3334) in both phosphorylated and unmodified forms, hybridoma fusion
and screening of clones in ELISA format. Aim 1b will involve measurement of phosphorylated and
unmodified IL-3334 levels in human lung tissue and bronchial wash from non-COPD and COPD specimens.
Together, these aims will address key features of chronic airway disease that may serve as novel
biomarker assays and inform development of anti-IL-33 therapeutics."
10993483,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Infantile rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a newly identified and poorly understood aggressive cancer with immature
skeletal muscle properties that affects young children. Recent clinical sequencing efforts have identified a
spectrum of likely biologically related gene fusions that genetically define infantile RMS: the most common being
a fusion between two transcriptional co-activators with roles in normal muscle development, termed VGLL2-
NCOA2. Although we know the defining oncogenic event, there are no therapies targeting the genetics of the
disease. Thus, patients are treated with general chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, often ineffectively or with
harsh long-term side effects. There is a pressing need to understand the biology of infantile RMS, contextualize
infantile RMS biology with other RMS sub-types, and leverage this information to delineate therapeutic targets.
Progress is limited by a lack of animal models, cell lines, and PDXs to study the disease dynamics. My long-term
goal is to integrate vertebrate zebrafish, mouse, cell culture models and patient samples to identify conserved
genetic programs for RMS tumorigenesis and novel therapeutic strategies. Toward that end, this project’s main
objective is to elucidate the underlying biology and therapeutic targets in fusion-oncogene driven infantile RMS.
Our central hypothesis is that VGLL2-NCOA2 leverages normal developmental programs, including ARF6, to
mediate infantile RMS tumorigenesis, and that targeting these pathways is a therapeutic opportunity. Our specific
aims will address this hypothesis by: (Aim 1) Delineating VGLL2-NCOA2 structure-function requirements for
tumorigenesis, (Aim 2) Establishing mechanisms of VGLL2-NCOA2 and ARF6 cooperation in
rhabdomyosarcoma, and (Aim 3) Determining VGLL2-NCOA2 muscle lineage context and temporal
prerequisites for tumorigenesis. Completing these studies at the interface of developmental and cancer biology
will generate significant new knowledge regarding fusion-oncogene leveraging of developmental programs and
will identify potential therapeutic targets. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because it leverages
a cross-species comparative oncology approach to pinpoint the most important molecular drivers in a new
disease, and it is experimentally innovative because it utilizes multiple new vertebrate (zebrafish and mouse)
infantile RMS models developed by our group. Successful execution of this project will generate exciting data
focused on delineating the basic biology of infantile rhabdomyosarcoma to directly impact and guide clinical care."

To deeply understand the pharmacology and toxicology of a molecule, whether it be a drug, endogenous
chemical, or a natural product, the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) properties for
the molecule must be known. ADME has a tremendous influence on efficacy, safety, and dosing of therapeutic
agents. Thus, ADME science is at the core of translating basic science discoveries into effective therapies in
the clinic, optimization and individualization of drug therapy, and informing clinical and regulatory decision
making. There is unprecedented diversity in the approaches available for research and discovery of new
treatments for disease. The pace of discovery has increased immensely, and an epic expansion of new
knowledge and therapeutic modalities is well underway. In this 52nd meeting of the Drug Metabolism Gordon
Research Conference we will embrace the foundational character of ADME science as a guiding force in what
is now a multiverse of scientific discovery consisting of grand diversity. ADME science is characterized as
being highly integrative, multidisciplinary, and based on structural, mechanistic, kinetic, quantitative, and
computational approaches to predict and translate molecular discoveries to effective clinical application. At the
forefront will be the presentation and discussion of research that embraces these foundational characteristics
and their application to: 1) metabolite identification, pathways, and distribution, 2) ADME enzymes and
transporters, 3) protein degraders, and 4) interpretation/application of fraction unbound for drug clearance
prediction. We will share cutting-edge science and emphasize the importance of interconnectedness among
disciplines so that we fully embrace the potential of emerging technologies to inform ADME studies,
technologies such as mass spec imaging, cryogenic electron microscopy, new methods for drug-drug
interaction prediction, and microphysiological devices. The conference will bring together academic, industry
and regulatory scientists at all career stages and provide a stimulating and welcoming environment to discuss
unpublished research. The informal venue with communal dining and housing provides an ideal environment to
establish this. This conference will provide a forum for early career scientists to interact with leaders in their
respective fields, expand their knowledge, establish collaborative relationships, and consider various career
paths. Scientific sessions are held in the mornings and evenings over 4.5 days with the afternoons available for
informal discussions and recreation. GRC meetings are small and designed for more discussion time during
both the formal scientific sessions and during informal interactions (e.g., poster sessions, mealtimes, afternoon
outings). To facilitate ample opportunity to discuss their work, the Drug Metabolism GRC organizes four, two-
hour poster sessions, with each poster presenter (at least 60) available for discussion during two sessions. The
2-day Gordon Research Seminar will precede the main GRC conference. It provides a unique environment for
students and early career scientist to present, connect and access mentoring."

Incidence of HPV+ OPC has been increasing for several decades and this upward trend is expected to continue
until at least 2060. Current first-line modalities to manage HPV+ OPC patients are effective but not without
limitations. A key event in HPV-driven tumorigenesis is the inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor program.
HPV oncogene, E6, inactivates p53 through two distinct pathways: HPVE6 promotes the assembly of the
HPVE6-E6AP-p53 trimeric protein complex resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of p53, and HPVE6
directly binds to p300 to block p300-directed acetylation and activation of p53. We hypothesized that disrupting
the HPVE6-p300 interaction will liberate sufficient p300 to restore p53 and p300 functionality simultaneously in
HPV+ OPC. Our team initiated a drug discovery platform to target the HPVE6-p300 interaction. Our work showed
that in HPV+ OPC models: (a) HPVE6 binds to the CH1 domain of p300, (b) our lead molecule, OHM1, a
CH1/p300 ligand, disrupts HPVE6-p300 interaction and reactivates p53 and p300, (c) OHM1 is active in vitro
and in vivo, and (d) concurrent OHM1+cisplatin combination treatment yields durable complete anti-tumor
responses in vivo. Our results are very compelling and, supports further research and development of dual p53
and p300 reactivation as a therapeutic strategy for HPV+ OPC. In this project, we propose to extensively
determine the mechanisms of action of p53 and p300 reactivation in response to OHM1 in HPV+ OPC. The
specific aims are: (1) determine if OHM1 modulates the p53 post-translational modification code to control p53
functionality and levels, and promote anti-cancer activity in HPV+ OPC, (2) to determine if OHM1 reshapes the
tumor-microenvironment and boost immunotherapy response in HPV+ OPC."
10980620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The link between depression in mothers and their children is well established, and there is growing evidence that
children’s biased attention to facial displays of emotion – specifically, attentional avoidance of sad faces – may
represent a key mechanism of risk that develops early in life. Despite the strengths of previous research,
important questions remain. First, studies that have examined attentional biases in infants of mothers with
depression have all been cross-sectional. Second, although researchers have proposed a key role for infant
arousal in the development of these attentional biases (i.e., that attentional avoidance of sad faces serves to
regulate infants’ arousal), this has not been explicitly tested. Third, published studies focus on the impact of
mothers’ depression on infant outcomes. However, there are likely transactional influences between mothers
and their infants. Fourth, depression is a heterogeneous and highly comorbid disorder, leaving unclear whether
there are specific aspects of mothers’ depression presentation that are most strongly associated with the
development of infants’ attentional biases. This study was designed to address these key questions and provide
a more fine-grained understanding of a specific, early emerging mechanism of risk. The study will include a
sample of 6–12-month-old infants of mothers with a history of MDD since the baby’s birth (n=150) or no lifetime
history of MDD (n=75) with assessments every 3 months for 12 months (5 assessments total). Aim 1 is to
prospectively examine the influence of depression in mothers on the development of infants’ attentional biases
for facial displays of emotion using a combination of mother-infant interaction and computer-based tasks. This
will allow us to determine whether depression in mothers predicts infants’ attentional avoidance of sad faces
over their first two years of life. In addition to examining the influence of mothers’ depression broadly, we will
also examine aspects of the depression presentation (facial affect and behavior) that may specifically predict the
development of infants’ attention biases. Aim 2 is to examine infants’ arousal as a mechanism underlying their
attentional avoidance of sad faces. To do this, we will measure dynamic changes in infants’ physiological activity
time-locked to shifts in infants’ attention toward versus away from their mother during standardized mother-infant
interaction tasks. Finally, although we are primarily focused on the impact of mothers on infants, we recognize
that effects are almost certainly transactional, with infants’ attentional avoidance further increasing mothers’
depression. Aim 3 is to examine these transactional relations both within each assessment by focusing on
changes in mothers’ facial affect during each interaction task and between assessments focusing on prospective
changes in mothers’ depressive symptoms. This research will lead to a more detailed understanding of specific
mechanisms by which depression in mothers impacts the developmental trajectory of infants’ attention to facial
displays of emotion, which is not only implicated in future depression risk but is also important for infants’ broader
short-term and long-term functioning."

Mu opioids, such morphine and fentanyl, remain in the mainstream for moderate and severe pain management.
However, they also produce many side-effects such as tolerance and addiction, leading to the development of
opioid use disorder, a main cause of the opioid epidemic and climbing opioid overdose death. Mechanisms
underlying mu opioid actions, particularly their side-effects such as tolerance and reward, are extremely complex
and involve multiple distinct systems or diverse signaling pathway. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein
(FTO) was initially identified as a demethylase of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), a modified nucleotide in mRNA.
Later, it was found that Fto exhibits significantly higher catalytic activity in demethylation of N6,2'-O-
dimethyladenosine (m6Am) compared to m6A. Accumulating evidence suggests that FTO influences gene
expression by modulating mRNA stability, alternative splicing, translation, and epigenetic modulation. Notably,
FTO has emerged as an important molecular player in various neuronal functions, and neuropsychiatric
disorders. Recently, we investigated the involvement of FTO in mu opioid actions, specifically tolerance and
reward in mice. Our preliminary data demonstrated that Fto depletion or inhibition significantly reduced morphine
and fentanyl tolerance and morphine reward measured by conditioned place preference (CPP). Furthermore,
depleting Fto in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) by microinjecting AAV-Cre in Ftofl/fl mice or the dorsal root
ganglion (DRG) by inducing Cre expression in the DRG by tamoxifen in Ftofl/fl:Advillin-CreER2 mice led to
attenuation of morphine CPP and tolerance, respectively. Additionally, we performed a preliminary transcriptome
study using the NAcSh of Fto-NAcSh-depleted mice, which revealed alterations in gene expression and
alternative splicing. Collectively, these strongly support an overarching hypothesis that Fto contributes to mu
opioid reward and tolerance in the NAcSh and DRG, respectively, through distinct molecular mechanisms. FTO
inhibition or modulation of a key molecule or pathway downstream of FTO in a specific region may therefore
represent a new approach for preserving mu opioid analgesia while mitigating specific unwanted side effects. To
test this hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims. Aim 1. Determine the role of Fto in the NAcSh
and DRG on mu opioid tolerance and reward by CPP and intravenous self-administration. Aim 2. Determine if
the role of Fto in the NAcSh and DRG on mu opioid reward and tolerance is mediated by increased m6Am or
m6A by using double-floxed mouse models, Ftofl/flPcif1fl/fl and Ftofl/flMettl3fl/fl. Aim 3. Investigate molecular
mechanisms underlying the role of Fto in the NAcSh and DRG on mu opioid reward and tolerance using several
cutting-edge approaches, including m6Am/m6A mapping, miCLIP, SLAM-seq, GLORI, ribosome profiling and
RNA-seq. The proposed studies promise to provide new insights into in vivo molecular mechanisms in mu opioid

10982248,"The 4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is associated with accelerated aging and mortality as well as increased
vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although the causal links between APOE4, aging, and AD risk remain
to be fully defined, candidate mechanisms include regulation of systemic immunometabolic outcomes. Our
recent findings demonstrate that treatment with the novel mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c increases
healthy lifespan. Indeed, pathways identified to be beneficially regulated by MOTS-c overlap with pathways
thought to underlie relationships among APOE4, aging, and AD. In this proposal, we investigate the central
hypothesis that MOTS-c is a geroprotective peptide that targets systemic APOE4 phenotypes implicated
in driving age-related cognitive impairment and AD pathogenesis. We will investigate this hypothesis by
studying systemic and neural effects of MOTS-c across age in mice with human APOE genotypes both in the
absence and presence of AD transgenes and in tau mice. Our studies will interrogate potential mechanisms
hypothesized to underlie the protective actions of MOTS-c with an emphasis on lipid homeostasis and
macrophage reprogramming. We propose three aims that are highly interactive across the labs of the two mPI
labs who have strong expertise in AD and APOE (Dr. Pike) and MOTS-s and geroscience (Dr. Lee). Aim 1:
Does MOTS-c protect against APOE4-associated aging phenotypes? We test the hypothesis that MOTS-c
will improve systemic and neural outcomes in the contexts of aging and APOE4 genotype. Studies will test the
ability of MOTS-c to prevent vs treat APOE4-associated phenotypes. We will also test the prediction that
inhibition of endogenous MOTS-c will exacerbate aging outcomes, especially with APOE4 genotype. Aim 2:
Does MOTS-c treatment provide protection/treatment against Alzheimer pathology in an APOE-
dependent manner? The second aim is conceptually parallel to Aim 1 but with a focus on MOTS-c and APOE
genotype in the context of AD pathology. These studies will be conducted in male and female APOE3 vs APOE4
AD mice and tau mice to determine potential sex differences and at two different ages to consider efficacies for
both the prevention and treatment. As in Aim 1, we will also consider the effects of inhibiting endogenous MOTS-
c. Aim 3: Does MOTS-c reprogram aging APOE4 macrophages/microglia to protect from Alzheimer
pathology? We investigate the hypothesis that a primary mechanism by which MOTS-c protects against APOE4
phenotypes is reprogramming of monocyte-derived macrophages and microglia at both transcriptional and
functional levels. Studies will test whether MOTS-c-programmed macrophages/microglia are poised to clear A
more effectively and resolve inflammatory phenotypes that can impede neuronal homeostasis. Completion of
the proposed studies will yield preclinical data that define the interactions and underlying mechanisms among
MOTS-c, APOE genotype, sex, age, and intervention timing, relationships that are essential to the effective
clinical translation of this novel mitochondrial-derived peptide approach to combat cognitive decline and AD."
10980706,"SUMMARY COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
As climate change impacts become increasingly visible in the US Caribbean (Puerto Rico [PR] and US Virgin
Islands [USVI]), and adaptation measures move from the planning to the implementation stage, those affected
by climate risks and adaptation strategies cannot be ignored. A fundamental principle of community-engaged
research is to involve people who are most likely to be affected by an issue, as partners in the research process;
where research becomes a tool to be used by communities. The Community Engagement Core (CEC) is
essential as an anchor to the multimethod approach and achievement of the goals proposed by the Caribbean
Climate Change Adaptation, Cancer, and Health Disparities Research Center (CCCARIB-CARES). The CEC will
use a Human-Centered Approach to anchor the collaborative activities that will be designed to involve a range
of stakeholders and community members in both PR and USVI in a Community Coalition of Partners whose
input and assistance will engender effective ways of supporting an increased understanding of climate change
impacts and their linkages to public health issues such as managing cancer and responses to environmental
pollution. It is expected that culturally and linguistically appropriate information and other outputs will be co-
created and applicably disseminated to the diverse and socio-economically challenged communities of PR and
the USVI. The goal will be achieved through the following specific aims: 1) Co-develop and implement a
Community Engagement Plan and establish a Community Coalition of Partners in PR and USVI to collaborate
with project personnel to co-create and disseminate culturally and linguistically appropriate information on cancer
risk factors, cancer control and their linkage to climate change impacts; 2) Develop an inclusive, responsive,
multi-level mechanism to effectively address translation and dissemination of research and CCCARIB-CARES
project findings to the varied audiences of PR and USVI communities and 3) Develop culturally sensitive Toolkits
focused on preparedness for extreme weather events for stakeholders, communities and cancer patients in PR
and USVI. The approach, relationships built and supported, and outputs of the CEC are expected to positively
impact community literacy regarding the linkages between climate change on health and the linkages between
climate change and cancer health. Through the work of the CEC, members of the target communities will be
aware of the resources available to them and can access care and services more effectively. The inclusive and
response approach taken by CEC will support targeted communities aiming to reduce health disparities and to
increase their equity position in society."

The long-term goal of the parent grant (1R01GM138448-01A1) is to get a better understanding
of how the extensive family of the Coronins transduces cellular signaling cues into actin network
remodeling to support cell migration, intracellular transport and cytokinesis. Coronins are bona
fide actin-binding proteins, however they do not directly alter actin filament dynamics. Instead,
they function as signaling scaffolds that recruit a host of other actin-remodeling and actin-
regulatory proteins that work in concert to alter actin network architecture and/or dynamics. Most
of our understanding of the Coronins stems from studies on the structurally and functionally
related short Coronins (Coro1-6), but next to nothing is known about the long or tandem Coronins
(Pod-1, Coro7). Leveraging the expertise of the lab in single molecule TIRF microscopy, we are
investigating how Coro7 regulates actin filament dynamics, directly as well as indirectly through
interaction with actin-regulatory proteins, including the other Coronins. Additionally, we have
performed an in-depth proteomic analysis to build the first Coro7 interactome and developed
several Coro7 CRISPR knockout cell lines. Combined with our insights gained from the
biophysical and biochemical characterization of Coro7, we will use these tools to determine how
Coro7 mechanistically regulates cell migration and intracellular trafficking, and by extension tumor
cell metastasis and invasion.

Nearly one third of the world’s population lacks access to adequate food, and over three billion people cannot
afford a healthy diet. Nutrition insecurity - the lack of consistent access, availability, and affordability of foods and
beverages that promote well-being and prevent disease
- leads to both undernutrition and obesity/overweight: a
‘dual burden’ associated with high rates of non-communicable disease, particularly in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). This is especially true in informal urban settlements, where our work has shown that a lack
of formal infrastructure and access to services exacerbates underlying social and economic barriers to eating
well. Adolescence is an optimal time to intervene to reduce nutrition insecurity and malnutrition. However,
interventions seldom target adolescents, nor are they tailored to the lived experiences of adolescents or to the
broader systems that influence adolescent food choices and nutrition security. The overarching goal of this
project is to reduce nutrition insecurity and malnutrition among adolescents in LMICs. To do this we employ an
innovative combination of participatory ‘systems thinking’ methods, quantitative empirical data, and modeling.
We will work in informal and formal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya so that we can characterize differences in the
food systems between them, and understand how these differences, and other individual-, household- and
community-level factors, influence adolescents’ food choices. We will (Aim 1) physically mapping the food
environments of 10 schools (2 per neighborhood in each of 5 neighborhoods) and use a participatory systems
science toolkit that includes cognitive mapping and group-based modeling to understand how adolescents make
decisions around food.
In parallel, we will
quantify the influence of nutrition insecurity on dietary patterns,
malnutrition, and food preferences (Aim 2) by conducting surveys (using standardized measures of food and
water insecurity and the perceived food environment) with adolescents and their primary caregivers as well as
repeated 24-hour dietary recalls, and physical measurements (body mass index, micronutrient status, and
hemoglobin) with adolescents (n=700) at three time points. Food preferences will be assessed by conducting a
discrete choice experiment with the adolescents included in our sample. The data from Aims 1 and 2 will then
be used to co-design food systems interventions to improve adolescents’ food choices, nutrition security, and
malnutrition outcomes and rank them using stakeholder-derived multi-criteria decision analysis (Aim 3). We will
work with local policymakers and community leaders to prioritize interventions with the potential to transform
LMIC food systems that are experiencing urban growth based on their feasibility and likely impact. This project
will address an urgent need to develop double-duty interventions that address the root cause of undernutrition
and overweight/obesity among adolescents in LMICs."
10982934,"PROJECT SUMMARY. The aim of this project is to decode new components of the LKB1 tumor suppressor
pathway to therapeutically target the 15-20% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) bearing mutations in this
gene. Research over the last 20 years has revealed multiple direct linkages between genes mutated in human
cancer and genes that control cell metabolism. The LKB1 tumor suppressor is a serine/threonine kinase
mutationally inactivated in the familial cancer disease Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome, as well as being the third most
frequently mutated gene in NSCLC, the most common cause of cancer deaths per year. To date, NSCLC patients
with an LKB1 (STK11) mutation fare worse than any other specific genetic subset, exhibiting minimal response
to chemotherapy and other targeted therapies. In recent years, multiple labs have found that STK11-mutant
patients are highly resistant to checkpoint immunotherapies and have minimal therapeutic potential regardless
of mutational burden. Twenty years ago, Dr. Shaw and others discovered that LKB1 directly phosphorylates the
activation loop of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 12 related kinases, turning on their kinase
activity. AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase activated by LKB1 under conditions of low intracellular ATP levels,
after mitochondrial damage, or following loss of glucose or oxygen. AMPK plays a highly conserved role as an
energy sensor and serves to restore metabolic homeostasis by downregulating mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) and parallel anabolic ATP-consuming processes (e.g., lipid biosynthesis), while
upregulating catabolic ATP-restoring processes (like autophagy and fatty acid oxidation). Studies by the Shaw
lab over the past 18 years have sought to understand the mechanistic basis for how AMPK and its related
kinases function by decoding their direct substrates that mediate downstream effects on growth and metabolism.
This may provide actionable targets for therapeutics aimed at this specific genetic LKB1-mutant subset of
NSCLC. The Shaw lab has also used multiple genetically engineered mouse models of NSCLC to perform
preclinical studies with novel cancer metabolism drugs they helped to develop. Building off prior Shaw lab
findings and new clinical insights of LKB1-mutation intractability, two lines of research are proposed. First, a new
in vivo autochthonous CRISPR screening technology will be utilized to directly query the tumorigenic potential
of hundreds of candidate substrates of AMPK and its related kinases to identify those targets that are essential
for tumor growth in Kras:LKB1 (“KL”) but not Kras (“K”) or Kras:p53 (“KP”) mutant tumors. This work builds off
successful phospho-proteomics screens that identified novel substrates of AMPK and the AMPK-related SIK
kinases critical for lung tumor cell survival. Secondly, to address the intrinsic resistance of KL-tumors to
checkpoint immunotherapies, screening will be deployed in combination with biochemical dissection of LKB1
signaling pathway to identify genes that, when deactivated, restore KL-tumors’ responsiveness to checkpoint
immunotherapeutics. Preliminary data demonstrates an unexpected key role for the CREB pathway here."
10984849,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by
hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum and pons that is often fatal within the first year of life. The cerebellum and
pons integrate information from sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain to regulate motor
movements, breathing, and learning motor behavior. Individuals with PCH1b show muscle atrophy/weakness,
microcephaly, and developmental delay. Most individuals with PCH1b do not live past childhood and current
treatment is purely palliative. Mutations that cause PCH1b occur in the EXOSC3 gene, which encodes a
structural cap subunit of an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed RNA processing complex, the
RNA exosome. The RNA exosome is a ribonuclease composed of both structural and catalytic subunits that play
a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNA. This complex is required for 3’ to 5’ processing and
degradation of a vast number of RNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Post-transcriptional processing of
RNA is a critical regulatory step in gene expression, as underscored by the number of neurological diseases
caused by defects in RNA processing factors. The tissue-specific phenotypes caused by the RNA exosome
complex are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited
analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. Thus, we aim to investigate the in vivo functional
consequences of distinct disease-causing amino acid substitutions in EXOSC3 that are linked to a range of mild
to severe phenotypes in PCH1b. We have generated an allelic series of EXOSC3 disease-linked missense
mutations in the Drosophila orthologue Rrp40 via CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology. Our previous work in flies
revealed an enhanced requirement for Rrp40 in neurons. Furthermore, our RNA-seq analysis of brain-enriched
transcriptomes of Rrp40 mutants revealed increases in steady-state levels of functionally important neuronal
transcripts, suggesting that disease-causing amino acid changes in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40
contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Our goal now is to characterize how disease-causing amino acid substitutions
in Rrp40 alter the molecular and cellular landscape of the developing nervous system in Drosophila in vivo. We
will test the hypothesis that the RNA exosome regulates RNAs that are critical for proper
neurodevelopment and function, a distinct subset of which are regulated by the RNA exosome cap
subunit Rrp40 (EXOSC3) through three complementary aims: 1) Assess the functional consequences of amino
acid substitutions in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40 corresponding to those that cause PCH1b; 2)
Interrogate how Rrp40 mutations affect expression and localization of key neuronal transcripts within the fly
brain; and 3) Exploit a genetic screen to determine whether aberrant accumulation of specific RNA exosome
targets disrupt fly development and/or homeostasis. Successful completion on these aims will provide a
synergistic understanding of RNA exosome biology and invaluable insights into PCH1b disease etiology."
10985915,"PROJECT SUMMARY______________________________________________________________________
One-third of heart transplant recipients will develop acute rejection of their new heart within the first post-
transplant year. These episodes can cause worsening heart failure, acceleration of chronic rejection, and
decrease post-transplant survival. Although immunosuppression decreases the risk of rejection, its long-term
use is associated with infection, cancer, and worsening kidney disease, all of which may limit the lifespan of a
patient after transplant. The ability to safely minimize immunosuppression without increasing the risk of
rejection would improve heart transplant recipients' outcomes. Calculating the risk of rejection for a given
patient remains a clinical challenge, as age, sex, and immunologic mismatch between the donor and recipient
are incomplete predictors of risk. While several non-invasive tests are available to diagnose rejection after
transplant, there is not currently an assay that can be used before transplant to quantify whether a recipient is
more prone to infection or rejection. If we could identify heart transplant candidates at low risk for rejection, we
could safely minimize immunosuppression and its toxicities without increasing the risk of graft loss. The
objective of the proposed study is to leverage a large, well-phenotyped cohort with existing biospecimens and
multi-omic technologies to identify novel pre-transplant biomarkers associated with clinically significant
rejection within the first post-transplant year. First, we will perform proteomic profiling to validate three
biomarkers (FGF-2, SPRTY-2, IRAK-1) we identified in preliminary studies as associated with rejection. We will
then expand our profiling on the Olink platform to include additional panels of proteins reporting on innate and
adaptive immune activation. We will test whether biomarkers provide incremental predictive utility, beyond a
set of prespecified clinical variables. Next, we propose to perform bulk RNA sequencing on peripheral blood
mononuclear cells prospectively collected before transplant & compare differential gene expression of
transcripts related to the protein biomarkers identified between recipients with and without rejection. We will
also perform whole transcriptomic profiling and pathway analysis to identify relevant biological processes
reporting on rejection risk. Finally, we will leverage novel machine learning approaches to identify an integrated
omics signature of rejection risk. The results of the current study will support the submission of future grants to
prospectively evaluate the use of these pre-transplant biomarkers in the clinical care of heart transplant
recipients."

resubmission in response to PAR-22-093. Prevention strategies, such as healthy sustainable
diets are critical and ase-related dementia (AD/ADRD) to have a population-wide
impact on reducing the risk of AD/ADRD for the growing aging population. Healthy diets are associated with slower
cognitive decline, reduced less AD pathology, and better cognitive resilience but the underlying
mechanisms of their protective effects are unknown. These diets are rich in antioxidant nutrients, flavonoids, and essential
fatty acids. Animal studies indicate the brain health benefits of these dietary factors via inflammatory and oxidative
pathways. Yet, our knowledge of how these dietary factors (diets, nutrients, and flavonoids) are related to mechanisms such
as neuroinflammation and brain oxidative stress, two important aspects of AD/ADRD pathogenesis and progression in
humans remains incomplete. Moreover, the diet association with emerging plasma AD and neurodegenerative biomarkers
is also not fully understood. This relationship can be studied to reflect the marker of AD pathology, degeneration, and brain-
reactive astrocytes among living persons. Disparities in AD are seen across race and sex and since relatively little is known
about diet and brain health in diverse populations, the link between diet and these biomarkers could be especially informative
in the underrepresented groups where autopsy rates are lower. The goal of this study is to examine the relationship between
diet, neuroinflammation, brain oxidative stress, and plasma neurodegenerative biomarkers in a diverse population, to
elucidate the link between diet and AD/ADRD. We will collect new data and leverage existing data capitalizing on four
harmonized, well-characterized, longitudinal community cohorts that enroll participants without dementia with high follow-
up rates, annual clinical evaluations, plasma collection, and brain tissue collection for those who come to autopsy. In the
first aim using autopsied brains, we will examine the relationship of diet over follow-up years with hippocampal and mid-
frontal activated microglia. Activated microglia is an early effect of neuroinflammation which enhances the risk of AD. In
the second aim, leveraging the data we assess the association of diet with oxidized lipids in the brain, which reflects oxidative
stress, another potential pathway for diet and AD. In the third aim, we examine the association of plasma phosphorylated-
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with diet in our diverse sample
and also investigate race and sex differences to inform us if group-specific dietary approaches may impact these AD/ADRD
outcomes. Additionally, we examine if these plasma biomarkers are associated with activated microglia and/or oxidized
brain lipids. These data will advance the understanding of potential mechanisms linking diet with cognition and AD risk.
This study will also inform designs of population-specific diet interventions and insight into personalized nutrition
approaches in AD using brain health biomarkers."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by the unrelenting loss of cortical neurons that manifests
clinically as devastating changes in the behavior, language, and personality of affected individuals.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a related neurodegenerative disease that results in rapidly progressive
motor deficits and eventual paralysis. Disease-modifying treatments for FTD and ALS remain elusive. Loss of
function variants in TBK1, which encodes a multifunctional protein kinase, represent one of the most common
genetic causes of FTD, ALS, and combined ALS/FTD. TBK1 has been implicated in innate immunity,
apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and autophagy. One of its key substrates is optineurin (OPTN), which functions
in selective autophagy, and haploinsufficiency of OPTN has been strongly linked to familial ALS/FTD. This
suggests that disruption of selective autophagy, which acts to maintain protein homeostasis and organelle
quality control, is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. However, selective autophagy has not been well-
characterized in neurons and how reduced TBK1 activity leads to the loss of excitatory neurons remains
unclear. Our preliminary efforts to systematically evaluate the effects of TBK1 loss-of-function, including
unbiased phospho-proteomics, indicate that TBK1 regulates the phosphorylation of numerous proteins
involved in autophagy and lysosomal pathways. Additionally, we have identified interactions between OPTN
and specific organelles. Our central hypothesis is that TBK1 controls OPTN and additional selective
autophagy cargo receptors to target proteins and organelles for degradation and maintain neural proteostasis.
The overall objective of this proposal is to integrate new stem cell-based models of ALS/FTD with advanced
proteomics for a comprehensive understanding of TBK1-associated autophagy pathways in human neurons.
In this proposal we aim to: 1) Identify novel TBK1 protein substrates in human stem-cell derived neurons and
characterize the effects of TBK1 loss on neural regeneration; 2) Define the consequences of OPTN loss and
disease-associated variants in autophagy; 3) Construct selective autophagy cargo receptor protein-protein
interaction networks in neurons and assess their contributions to a form of secretory autophagy. Our long-
term goal is to better understand selective autophagy to support the development of novel targeted
therapeutic approaches to modulate this pathway in age-related neurodegeneration."
10988513,"Cervical insufficiency (CI) describes the inability of the uterine cervix to retain a pregnancy in the absence of the
signs and symptoms of clinical contractions, or labor, or both in the second trimester. The presumed cause of CI
is “weak” cervical tissue, intrinsic or acquired. However, the known pathophysiology of CI is extremely limited.
The current CI diagnosis is based on either a past obstetric history or on a combination of obstetric history and
transvaginal ultrasound measurement of cervical length. Nonetheless, there is no objective test to evaluate
cervical tissue strength as a means to confirm a diagnosis of CI. Moreover, the diagnosis of CI cannot be made
outside of pregnancy by any test. Recently, cervical function has been considered to be a continuum instead of
a dichotomy. Previous studies showed that the collagen content in biopsy specimens was lower in patients with
CI and in non-pregnant women complicated by previous mid-trimester abortions compared to controls. These
findings suggest that the assessment of cervical function before pregnancy may identify a “weak” cervix with a
baseline functional defect, which varies with the severity of weakness. While the mechanical strength of the
cervix is known to partly rely on the collagen network in the extracellular matrix, recent studies found that the
internal os area is significantly more cellular than the external os and contains around 50-60% smooth muscle
cells (SMCs). The SMCs of the internal os are generally circumferentially oriented around the endocervical canal,
possibly similar to a “sphincter”, whose functional failure may explain why the internal os dilates/funnels first in
premature cervical remodeling. In case of normal “multiparous cervix”, the external os remains soft and dilated,
while the internal os is firmly closed. Hence, it may be necessary to assess the “sphincter” function of the cervix
to assess its “weakness”. In studies on various smooth muscle organs, the smooth muscle function is related to
the local blood flow and perfusion. Thus, in this study, we suggest using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)
to quantify the blood perfusion in the cervix. CEUS uses the administration of an intravenous ultrasound contrast
agent (UCA) comprised of gas-filled microbubbles that remain within blood vessels reflecting vascularization and
blood perfusion. Furthermore, we suggest the novel concept evaluating the microvascular pressure (MVP) of the
cervix as a functional marker to assess the cervical weakness. MVP is a driving force for local blood perfusion.
UCA not only enhances the backscattered ultrasound signals, but can also act as pressure sensors. Our group
developed the fundamental concept of subharmonic (half of fundamental frequency) aided pressure estimation
(SHAPE) using CEUS and showed its potential to noninvasively estimate intra-cardiac pressures, hepatic venous
pressure gradients, and tumoral interstitial fluid pressure in patients. The objective of this study is to determine
if the blood perfusion and/or MVP around the internal os of uterine cervix can distinguish patients with a history
of CI (presumably “weak” cervix) from normal controls in a non-pregnant state. We hypothesize that the blood
perfusion is higher with lower MVP around the internal os in patients with a history of CI than in normal controls."

Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Although immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has
benefited many melanoma patients, most patients do not respond to current ICB. Vaccines can promote ICB
therapeutic efficacy by generating or amplifying tumor-reactive T cells. Conventional vaccines are associated
with limitations such as low stability and bioavailability, preexisting anti-viral-vector immunity, weak antigenicity,
or concerns over genomic integration or virulent reversion. mRNA vaccines hold a great potential for cancer
immunotherapy. Yet, current linear mRNA vaccines are still associated with 1) limited biostability, despite
structural and nucleoside modifications, and the resulting limited shelf-life and moderate antigen translation
efficiency, 2) complicated, time-consuming, and error-prone enzymatic mRNA production, 3) limited loading
capacity in nanocarriers, and 4) short immune memory. To address these limitations, we propose developing
novel, highly stable, modification-free multivalent small circular mRNA (circRNA) to elicit potent and durable
antitumor immunity for ICB combination immunotherapy of melanoma. Small circRNA is comprised of minimal
RNA elements to translate peptide antigens. We showed that 1) small circRNA has high loading capacity in
nanocarriers and efficiently accumulates in lymph nodes and antigen-presenting cells; 2) terminus-free small
circRNA, either free or loaded in nanoparticles, are highly stable relative to current state-of-the-art modified
mRNA vaccine; 3) circRNA vaccines are self-adjuvanted due to intrinsic activation of intracellular pattern
recognition receptors; 4) circRNA prolong antigen translation accompanied by innate immunostimulation, which
promotes T cell responses; 5) circRNA may produce concatemeric long peptide antigens that, relative to minimal
antigens, undergo proteolytic processing for optimal antitumor T cell responses; and 6) low-dose small circRNA
vaccines outperform several current state-of-the-art modified mRNA vaccines to generate potent and durable T
cell immunity. Further, a multivalent circRNA vaccine elicited significantly potentiated ICB therapeutic efficacy of
melanoma in mice. The objective of this project is to develop and test multivalent melanoma circRNA to elicit
multivalent antimelanoma T cell responses and reduce melanoma tumor immunosuppression, elucidate their
molecular and cellular mechanisms to elicit innate and adaptive antitumor immunity, and assess their melanoma
therapeutic efficacies and toxicity in mice. Our highly collaborative team has complementary expertise in circRNA
vaccine, melanoma vaccinology, and clinical melanoma immunotherapy for accomplishing our scientific goals.
If successful, a significant deliverable from this study is to establish a scientific framework for using this novel
mRNA vaccines in melanoma combination immunotherapy."

Unraveling the molecular mechanisms that link SNPs and genes identified in GWAS studies to
the disease is a challenge that must be overcome to translate these genetic discoveries into
actionable health insights. We would like to build a machine learning tool on the basis of visible
neural networks (vNN) that recently showed success to provide predictive and explanatory
power on cellular responses to gene regulations or disease treatment. Key to the vNN approach
is an understandable network such as Knowledge Graph that contains rich annotations of
relevant entities and relationships among entities organized by integrative data sources. Our
hypothesis is that organizing and integrating data from the Common Fund Data Ecosystem
(CFDE) can enhance the explanatory power of vNN to illuminate GWAS results. We propose
combining the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph with diverse biological data from the CFDE, and
vNN as a knowledge-based architecture to provide high interpretability in supervised learning.
ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph will serve as an organizational hub for integrating CFDE data
with existing knowledge. This query-able resource for CFDE data will be our first deliverable.
We will extract network-based relationships from this data and train vNN using genotypes and
phenotypes from T2D-focused GWAS, providing our second deliverable. The trained vNN, our
third deliverable, will enable the prediction of T2D phenotypes from genotype data. Lastly, we'll
provide the code base as a platform to expand this KG and vNN approach to other GWAS
studies and potentially be generalized for genome wide ‘omic analyses with large data sets."
10990117,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), aimed at reinvigorating immune cells such as T-cells, has exhibited clinical
success in a subset of patients yet fails to be applicable to many tumor subtypes. These unresponsive subtypes
upregulate gene signatures associated with amino acid (AA) metabolism and deprivation. However, how AA
deprivation contribute to poor ICB response remains unclear. Upon chronic antigen stimulation, T-cells become
“exhausted”, an alternative differentiation state that entails the loss of cytotoxic effector function and proliferative
capacity. T-cell exhaustion involves extensive transcriptomic and epigenetic remodeling; however, the loss of
cytokine production occurs despite adequate expression of transcripts encoding cytokines, suggesting post-
transcriptional mechanisms of restricting effector function within tumors. The long-term goal is to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying T-cell dysfunction within the tumor microenvironment and leverage these insights to
enhance ICB efficacy. The predoctoral research (Aim 1) will aim to investigate how local AA availability limits
effector function in tumor-infiltrating T-cells. Preliminary data showed that intratumoral T-cells can not engage in
efficient translation and they experience glutamine deprivation in the tumor microenvironment. Elevated
translational demand downstream of chronic T-cell receptor signaling cannot be met when extracellular AAs are
limiting, restricting both global translation rate and cytotoxic cytokine production. Specific Aim 1.1 will seek to
determine how local AA availability impacts the exhausted T-cell proteome. Nascent transcriptomic and
translatomic alterations will be profiled to evaluate the impact of AA limitation on gene-specific translation rates,
followed by ribosomal footprinting assays to identify cell state- and AA-dependent stalling in vivo. Specific Aim
1.2 will investigate the impact of enhancing AA availability on ICB. A broad-spectrum AA transporter will be
overexpressed in T-cells to examine whether it enhances tumor control in response to ICB and overcomes the
immunosuppressive effects conferred by cancer-associated fibroblasts via restricting intratumoral AA availability.
My postdoctoral research (Aim 2) will focus on the role of non-coding RNAs in translational suppression during
terminal T-cell exhaustion. I will profile how T-cell exhaustion impact the expression of non-coding RNAs and
examine whether non-coding RNA subsequently modulates translation and cytokine production. Overall, these
two projects will unveil the distinct mechanisms driving T-cell dysfunction through translational suppression
during early tumor-infiltration and late terminal exhaustion. The research and training plan outlined in this
proposal will be completed with the joint mentorship of Dr. Santosha Vardhana and Dr. Jayanta Chaudhuri at
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). MSK’s top-notch cancer research environment and abundant
resources in conjunction with the support of the Gerstner Sloan Kettering Graduate School will guarantee the
successful completion of the proposed research and career development plans."
10990253,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an integrative measure of cardiopulmonary and metabolic health, and a
powerful, independent predictor of future risk of mortality. No pharmacotherapies target CRF, and while
exercise training (ET) remains the only established means to improve fitness, substantial inter-individual
variability exists in both its intrinsic (untrained) level as well as its response to ET. Limited information exists
regarding CRF’s underlying biology and identifying its molecular underpinnings may help inform our
understanding of the determinants of this clinically important trait. Emerging data highlight circulating
biochemicals, and in particular proteins, as mediators of exercise’s health benefits (“exerkines”).
To better understand the molecular pathways involved in exercise and CRF, the NIH Common Fund created
MoTrPAC, the most comprehensive effort to study human exercise to date. MoTrPAC includes gold-standard
measures of CRF (VO2max), and deep molecular profiling - including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and
large-scale plasma proteomics. Moreover, the MoTrPAC study designs utilizes a randomized, controlled trial of
ET with a non-exercise control arm to allow for the identification of determinants of VO2max changes in
response to ET (VO2max). Though the generation of large multi-omics data in MoTrPAC presents enormous
opportunity, a major challenge remains in identifying the most promising biochemical determinants of CRF to
be brought forth for further, mechanistic studies. We and others have previously shown that integrating
genetics, proteomics, and functional genomics (e.g. tissue expression and knockout models) using statistical
colocalization can inform understanding about a protein’s regulation and suggest a causal role in health and
disease. These studies can, in effect, prioritize plasma proteins to be triaged for further investigation.
This proposal integrates plasma proteomics, WGS and VO2max traits from MoTrPAC with tissue expression
data from GTEx to prioritize candidate protein determinants of CRF. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel 5,000
assay plasma proteomics platform (Olink5K) in ~1,980 MoTrPAC participants undergoing ET to identify
circulating proteins related to baseline VO2max and VO2max leveraging the non-exercise control arm in
MoTrPAC. In Aim 2 we will: A) identify locally-acting (cis-) genetic instruments related to plasma proteins from
Aim 1 (cis-protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) from existing, publicly available datasets (TOPMed, UK
BioBank) as well as generate new cis-pQTLs using WGS from MoTrPAC; and B) gain functional insights into
the genetic regulation of VO2max-related proteins through colocalization with tissue expression in GTEx
(expression- or eQTLs). These experiments will help determine whether a plasma protein is regulated at the
transcriptional level and/or in tissues relevant to VO2max (e.g. heart, skeletal muscle) and set the stage for
further mechanistic studies that extend beyond the scope of this project."
10806205,"Intensive care unit (ICU) environments do not support sleep or preserve circadian rhythms of postoperative critically ill patients. Among the contributing factors is the common practice of administering nutrition support through feeding tubes overnight. Sleep and circadian rhythms, our 24-hour internal clock, are essential to human well-being. Acute disturbances are associated with inflammation and cardiometabolic derangements, two important factors known to impair patient recovery and contribute to longer stays at cardiac surgical ICUs. Thus, the overall objective of the study is to examine a novel dimension of clinical nutrition by determining whether enhancing sleep quality and preserving robust circadian rhythms through daytime instead of overnight feeds will attenuate inflammation and improve cardiometabolic profiles of postoperative cardiac ICU patients on nutrition support. In patients supported with home parenteral nutrition, we observed disrupted sleep largely driven by difficulty maintaining sleep. We also found differences in blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance in response to a glucose challenge administered during the biological evening relative to the morning in free-living adults. To be a researcher at the intersection of nutrition and chronobiology leading a “bench-to-bedside” translational precision nutrition research program, which directly tests discoveries from healthy subjects into patient populations, a logical next step is to evaluate the clinical translation of my findings in an ICU. I hypothesize that overnight nutrition support results in fragmented sleep and blunted circadian rhythms and thus represent a modifiable mechanism exacerbating inflammation and cardiometabolic derangements in postoperative cardiac patients. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: Aim 1 proposes a randomized-controlled, crossover trial of 60 ICU patients on enteral feeds to test the hypothesis that daytime compared to overnight enteral nutrition is associated with less fragmented sleep and more robust 24hr circadian rhythms (NCT04737200). Sleep and circadian rhythms will be assessed objectively using non-invasive and state-of-the-art technologies. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that daytime compared to overnight nutrition is associated with changes in metabolites involved in pathways related to circadian rhythms and inflammation via plasma metabolomics. This will be tested in the clinical trial from Aim 1 (n=60) and in a completed, complementary cross-over trial of free-living adults for generalizability (n=366; NCT02997319). Aim 3 will test the hypothesis in the clinical trial from Aim 1 that daytime compared to overnight enteral nutrition is associated with reduced inflammation and improved cardiometabolic profiles, including blood pressure and glucose. The proposed aims will provide ample data for a competitive R01 grant submission during the R00 phase on precision nutrition, an area of research aligned with the priorities of the NIH. This study will also provide the framework to reevaluate standard overnight nutrition practice likely affecting 250,000 hospital admissions annually in the US."
10976148,"SUMMARY
The pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) exploits aspects of host immunity to establish a
niche in the gut and outcompete the resident microbiota. Despite significant progress in understanding the
competitive dynamics between STm and the gut microbiota, there remain gaps in our knowledge regarding the
specific mechanisms involved in their interactions. Herein, we propose a combined approach that integrates
metagenomic (metaG), metatranscriptomic (metaT), and metatranslatomic (metaRS) profiles to elucidate new
mechanistic interactions between STm and the gut microbiota. Specifically, we will use quantitative metaG,
metaT, and integrate innovative community-level ribosome footprinting (metaRS) to construct a comprehensive
profile of resource allocation and substrate preferences within the gut microbiota. It is our expectation that these
combined approaches will lend insight into how metabolic niches are perturbed by STm colonization and
associated host immune responses. Through the integration of these multiomics, we have generated testable
hypotheses regarding potential mechanisms of competition between STm and the gut microbiota. We intend to
test these hypotheses in this research application. Our central hypothesis is that elucidating microbial
metabolism in the gut, in conjunction with the analysis of host responses, will unveil new competitors and
mechanisms of competition between STm and the gut microbiota. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing two
Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will analyze bacterial metabolism to identify potential Salmonella competitors in mice
and test the predictions in vitro and in vivo. We will validate the preliminary finding that STm infection depletes
specific members of the microbiota with similar metabolic profiles. We will also test the prediction that metabolic
overlap between STm and specific members of the microbiota reflects competition for resources in the gut. In
Aim 2, we will investigate whether host antimicrobial responses promote Salmonella competition with selected
members of the gut microbiota. Collectively, this study will provide a comprehensive analysis of bacterial
metabolism in the gut and how this is perturbed in the context of STm infection. Moreover, the study will test
hypotheses stemming from our preliminary data as well as generate and test new hypotheses concerning
mechanisms governing microbial competition, also in the context of host responses. Moving forward, the insights
garnered from this research hold promise for therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing STm colonization and
reinstating intestinal homeostasis."
10990748,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The adverse effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) on corticospinal function are not restricted
to the damaged spinal cord, but also disrupt motor representations within the cortex. SCI results in altered
cortical maps that represent motor output, with representations above the level of injury expanding into
affected cortical areas. Rehabilitation is necessary for both the recovery of corticospinal-dependent forelimb
function and the commensurate reorganization of disrupted cortical motor maps. Both the underlying circuit
mechanisms that support cortical reorganization after SCI as well as the necessity for the reorganized circuitry
to support functional recovery, remain unknown. For injured corticospinal neurons to contribute to functional
recovery, they must be integrated into cortical motor networks. The long-term goal is to develop therapeutic
interventions for supporting functional recovery after SCL The overall obiective for this proposal is to determine
how specific rehabilitation after SCI promotes remodeling of corticospinal circuits and the contribution of injured
corticospinal neurons to motor recovery. The central hypothesis is that corticospinal-dependent rehabilitation
after SCI directs the structural remodeling of injured corticospinal neurons resulting in their incorporation into
functional motor ensembles. The rationale for the proposed research is that determining the properties of
rehabilitative training that promote successful corticospinal circuit incorporation into cortical motor networks
after SCI will be crucial for developing effective rehabilitative strategies. The following three specific aims are
proposed: 1) Identify the nature of structural and connectivity changes that occur in injured corticospinal
neurons during rehabilitation-mediated recovery from SCI; 2) Identify the changes in the functional connectivity
of injured corticospinal neurons during rehabilitation-mediated recovery from SCI; and 3) Identify the
contribution of injured corticospinal neurons to motor recovery after SCL For the first aim, the approach will be
to image structural changes of injured corticospinal dendritic arbors in response to rehabilitation. In the second
aim, the approaches will be to use 2-photon imaging to record the activity of injured corticospinal neurons
during rehabilitation and to use retrograde transsynaptic tracing to identify presynaptic inputs. In the third aim,
the approach will be to optogenetically control injured corticospinal neurons in awake, behaving mice to
determine their contribution to recovery. The proposed studies are innovative in that they shift the focus of
spinal cord rehabilitation onto the circuit mechanisms of cortical network plasticity. The proposed studies are
significant because they will elucidate the mechanisms by which circuit remodeling influences recovery and will
inform combinatorial strategies that target cortical plasticity to fully realize the effects of axonal sprouting and
regeneration. The expectation is that completion of the proposed research will determine the role for injured
corticospinal neurons in the recovery of functional motor networks after SCI_ These findings will establish a
foundation to guide the development of therapeutic strategies targeting movement recovery after CNS injury."
10991931,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety is a highly prevalent symptom in the early stages of Alzheimer disease (AD), with correlation to AD
biomarkers and association with faster decline. As such, understanding the mechanism of anxiety in AD is
critical to understanding its impact on outcomes and to developing better therapies for this distressing
symptom that may also have disease-modifying effects. Yet, the pathophysiology of anxiety in AD is unclear.
The CA1 region of ventral hippocampus (vCA1) may play a critical role, given that it is vulnerable to AD and
that the activity of its pyramidal neurons (PNs) increases during anxious behavior in non-AD contexts.
Moreover, it receives direct input from nucleus reuniens of thalamus (nRT), and provides input to medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both of which have also been implicated in anxiety as well. Here, we propose
experiments in AD models known to display anxiety in order to support a central hypothesis that AD-related
anxiety is driven by increased engagement of the nRT→vCA1→mPFC circuit. This hypothesis is supported by
the above, as well as additional literature and preliminary data suggesting a role for nRT, vCA1, and mPFC in
AD-related anxiety and their vulnerability to intrinsic hyperexcitability and excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. Using
the 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD mouse models, we test our central hypothesis with the following aims. In Aim 1, we
use ex vivo opto-electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to elucidate AD-related alterations in the functional
synaptic architecture of the nRT→vCA1→mPFC circuit. In Aim 2, we use implantable microendoscope imaging
of GCaMP calcium signals, immediate early gene c-fos readouts, and retrograde labeling to determine the in
vivo activity of vCA1-projecting nRT neurons, mPFC-projecting vCA1 PNs, and mPFC PNs during anxious
behavior in AD mice. In Aim 3, we use optogenetic strategies to suppress or increase the activity of nRT input
to vCA1 PNs and vCA1 inputs to mPFC to determine the effect on anxious behavior in AD mice. We also test if
these manipulations also improve memory. This work will provide three major results that will in sum causally
test our central hypothesis and significantly add to the understanding of anxiety in AD, at the level of circuit
architecture (Aim 1), population activity (Aim 2), and population activity manipulation (Aim 3). This knowledge
will push forward a line of experimentation to develop treatments for anxiety in AD that may have disease-
modifying impact. More broadly, the knowledge uncovered related to this important but understudied circuit will
inform on other functions on this network in social and motivational behaviors, and cognitive performance."

projected that 13.8 million Americans will be living with AD, and the total annual expenditures for health, long-
term care, and hospice services for those with AD and other dementias could surge to $1.2 trillion. Developing
predictive artificial intelligent (AI) models to assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease is critically
important for patient management. However, current AI models for studying Alzheimer’s Disease often suffer
from explainability challenges, and the effects of race, sex, social determinant of health (SDOH), and
comorbidity are typically not considered in existing research but are critically important to consider for creating
ethical AI models. Building on our team’s pioneering work in explainable AI, studying the role of race, SDOH,
comorbidity in AD, and leveraging cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics for studying AD, we will develop
explainable and ethical AI models for both automated disease diagnoses and prognosis. We will build AI
models for multimodal data-fusion and leverage our pioneering work in CSF proteomics to understand
covariation patterns between brain volumetrics and connectome, amyloid and tau depositions, and CSF
proteins with a goal to enhance our understanding of AD pathophysiology. Successful completion of this study
will provide improved and ethical AI models that can be further developed into effective clinical decision
support tools as well as enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD."
10992082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease affects nearly half of all American adults. Achieving cardiovascular health is
associated with lower mortality and morbidity, but modifying and adhering to health behaviors such as diet
and other healthy lifestyle factors remain challenges to achieving it. Additionally, there are historically
marginalized communities of individuals who suffer the greatest burdens of cardiovascular disease and are in
urgent need of effective, pragmatic, and culturally appropriate interventions. To address these issues, we
must train the next generation of patient-oriented investigators who are rigorously mentored in cardiovascular
disease epidemiology, health equity, health disparities, and translational research methods; and who are
committed to doing the work with cultural humility and a global perspective. This proposal focuses on
necessary steps for developing a novel comprehensive and structured mentorship and research program that
will support mentees. This K24 award will provide protected time for Dr. Cheryl Anderson, a mid-career
clinical investigator who has her own independent peer- reviewed research support to recruit and mentor a
diverse group of trainees in clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and health equity. Dr. Anderson proposes to
facilitate a training environment that is rigorous, supportive, creative, and collaborative where mentees
develop their research in a manner that capitalizes on her expertise and preserves their independent lines of
research. The research program she proposes will build on her current grants and support her ability to
pursue developing new skills in health equity and global policy and strategy. More specifically, the award will
support the building of two new areas of research: 1) integration of the science of global policy and strategy
into multilevel interventions to improve cardiovascular health, and 2) development of skills to train others to be
effective change agents to disrupt health inequities via the creation of an “Advocacy Laboratory.” The
environment for this K24 is the University of California San Diego, a world-class institution with extensive
resources to support research that is patient-oriented and integrated with research in health equity and global
policy and strategy."
10993079,"Diabetes (DM) shortens lifespan, an impact that is not fully explained by traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk
factors. Functional Exercise Capacity (FEC) is a universal predictor of CV and all-cause mortality and it is
decreased in people with diabetes. The overall goal of our combined basic and clinical research
program is to understand and treat impaired FEC in DM to prevent premature mortality. New
data from our lab indicate that: Oxygen delivery uniquely limits in vivo muscle mitochondrial function in DM
(human); Modeling of muscle blood flow distribution reveals that the contributions of reduced flow and
capillary density were minor relative to the contributions of heterogeneous flow distribution (rodent) ;
Targeting of nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (NOS/NO) or glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) impacts FEC
(running distance) and demonstrate a correlation between muscle perfusion (blood flow, capillary density and
blood flow distribution) and oxygen consumption.
Hypothesis: Microvascular perfusion heterogeneity contributes to diabetes mediated muscle
fatigue, decreased muscle VO2 and impaired FEC and these endpoints will improve with two
different agents that improve muscle blood flow distribution -GLP-1 or Nitrites.
SA#1: To test the hypothesis that will GLP-1 and Nitrites will prevent or restore hyperglycemia-
mediated muscle perfusion heterogeneity, muscle fatigue and decreased muscle VO2: This aim
will employ a mouse model with inducible hyperglycemia to examine the impact of hyperglycemia on muscle
perfusion, muscle fatigue and muscle VO2. The second set of experiments will test the ability of GLP-1 or
Nitrites, targeting eNOS/NO by different mechanisms, to prevent or restore these endpoints. SA#2: To
examine the ability of GLP-1 or Nitrites to improve DM FEC and to augment the impact of
exercise training: We will determine the impact of GLP-1 or Nitrites on exercise performance with and
without hyperglycemia and exercise training. These experiments will address the overall hypothesis by
exploring the impact of GLP-1 or Nitrites on FEC and the exercise training response. SA#3: To define the
importance of GLP-1 receptors for muscle perfusion heterogeneity and function and for the
adaptation to exercise training: Published and preliminary data indicate that GLP-1 can augment
adaptation to exercise training and pilot data demonstrate that the GLP-1 receptor antagonist interferes with
the adaptive exercise training response. These studies will clarify whether endothelial cell GLP-1 receptors are
required for cardiometabolic adaptation to exercise training. Impact of these studies on the Veteran
Population: Diabetes decreases life expectancy and is highly prevalent in Veterans. Successful execution of
this research program will provide critical preclinical data for interventions that may acutely improve function
and increase the impact of physical activity on cardiovascular health in people with diabetes."
10993224,"Project Summary/Abstract
Loss of vision has a devastating impact on an individual's quality of life. Most blinding diseases result from loss
of neurons in the retina. A promising strategy to treat sight-threatening diseases, is to harness the regenerative
potential of cells within the retina. Müller glia (MG), possess an extraordinary capacity in lower vertebrates to
regenerate retinal neurons. However, in mammalian retinas, including humans, MG are unable to replace
neurons lost to injury or disease. Recently, we have developed strategies to neurogenically reprogram MG in
adult mice by overexpressing the transcription factor Ascl1 in MG. Remarkably, the treatment of Ascl1
overexpression, combined with NMDA-induced retinal damage and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition,
causes MG to regenerate functional neurons in the adult mammalian retina. While this is significant progress
towards realizing the therapeutic potential of MG, only a subset of MG successfully reprogram into neurogenic
progenitors while another subset of MG express genes associated with inflammatory processes. We
hypothesized that the inflammation that accompanies neuronal cell loss restricts the regenerative potential of
MG. Indeed, we recently found that ablation of microglia, the endogenous immune cell of the retina,
dramatically improved MG-mediated retinal regeneration. This finding implicates the neuroimmune system as a
key component of the regenerative response of the mammalian retina. However, little is known about the
neuroimmune interface in retinal repair strategies such as endogenous regeneration. This proposal outlines
studies to better understand the neuroimmune axis during MG-mediated retinal regeneration and to develop
immunomodulation strategies to improve the regenerative capacity of the mammalian retina. The data
generated in this proposal will be foundational to Dr. Todd's ultimate goal of becoming an independent
investigator. During the K99 portion, Dr. Todd will expand his technical and theoretical expertise in
neuroimmunology to accomplish his aims studying immune-glial interactions during retinal regeneration. New
collaborations will be established with investigators in neuroimmunology and further training activities will
prepare Dr. Todd to become a successful investigator in the field. The training portion of this proposal will take
place at the University of Washington, which offers exceptional access to both research equipment and faculty
expertise to assist in the accomplishment of the applicant's goals."

The 2024 National LGBTQ Health Conference will bring together leading researchers and practitioners,
trainees, and students to bridge research and practice to address health disparities for LGBTQ populations.
This proposal requests funding to support professional development and attendance and travel scholarships
for underrepresented groups at the 9th National LGBTQ Health Conference, a 3-day conference being held in
Atlanta at Emory University. Emory hosted this conference in 2019 with the conference founders, Northwestern
Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing (ISGHM) and Center on Halsted (COH). The
2024 conference will continue to build on previous successful conferences, and the leadership are experienced
conference leaders from Emory University and Northwestern University. When the conference was hosted in
Atlanta in 2019, the goal was to expand its scope of attendees due to a regional change in location, new
thought leaders, and the formation of the National Scientific Review and Program Committee. All these
initiatives were highly successful, and the conference was the largest to date and included the most
geographic, age and professional diversity. The overall goal of this conference is to catalyze research to reduce
and eliminate health disparities among LGBTQ people by improving both research and practice on LGBTQ
health by convening an interprofessional audience to present and discuss innovative translational findings in
the field; to provide intentional professional development and networking opportunities for the next
generation of practitioners and researchers in LGBTQ health; and to recruit and support attendance of
students, post-docs, and junior faculty with a focus on inclusion of underrepresented groups. Health
disparities among LGBTQ people are severe and affect life expectancy, mental and physical health, access to
and quality of care, and overall quality of life even for youth. Critical disparities are found in risk and incidence
of mental health issues including suicide, substance abuse, HIV and other STIs and are linked to minority
status, stigma, discrimination, and denial of human and civil rights. As is the case among other minorities
experiencing disparities, these disparities are not borne equally among all LGBTQ people: transgender people,
LGBTQ people of color, youth, and low-income people bear a disproportionate burden of these disparities. The
proposed 2024 National LGBTQ Health Conference is an important opportunity to gather the best knowledge
and practice in the field through an intersectional lens to improve the lives of all LGBTQ people."

supports the development of researchers to translate neuroscience discoveries into psychiatric
clinical practice and to use clinical observations to generate new discoveries in neuroscience.
The specific aim of this R13 proposal is to provide support for early career investigators for the
following activities:
 ● Career development sessions, including
 ○ Curated interactions with to more senior investigators;
 ○ A panel discussion on diversity, equity, and inclusion in the computational
 psychiatry field;
 ○ A career journey discussion.
 ● Two tutorials to allow researchers with limited expertise to broaden their
 knowledge base; the tutorials are particularly important for this community
 because this conference brings together researchers from two very separate
 expertises (computational neuroscience and clinical psychiatry).
 ● Poster awards for trainees.
 ● Travel support for early career investigators from communities underrepresented

10982145,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In humans, microRNAs (miRNAs) are key components of mature RNA-induced silencing complexes (mature
RISCs) involved in silencing specific genes. Recent research has uncovered a new class of smaller RNAs
called tinyRNAs (tyRNAs), which are shorter than miRNAs and associate with AGO proteins to form tyRNA-
induced silencing complexes (tyRISCs). A significant discovery is the existence of a tyRNA biogenesis pathway
driven by specific exonucleases, resulting in the production of 14-nt tyRNAs from AGO-associated 21~23 nt
miRNAs. Some tyRNAs, known as ""cleavage-inducing tyRNAs (cityRNAs),"" can catalytically activate
Argonaute3 (AGO3). Despite these breakthroughs, the study of tyRNAs is in its infancy, with only a limited
number of papers compared to miRNAs. The primary goal is to comprehensively understand the roles of
tyRNAs, with three specific aims:
Aim 1: Investigate the mechanism of target recognition and cleavage by cityRISC. AGO3 loaded with 14-nt
cityRNA cleaved a complementary target RNA at low efficiency. Cleavage was enhanced when the target was
extended by 9 nt on its 5' side, suggesting AGO directly recognizes the sequence of the extended target site.
This challenges the conventional idea that the guide is essential for target recognition. Structural studies and
RNA sequencing will provide insights into this unique target recognition.
Aim 2: Explore the structural basis for neurodevelopmental disease-relevant AGO1s (NDD-AGO1s). NDD-
AGO1s with specific mutations exhibit abnormal trimming of associated miRNAs. Cryo-EM structures of these
mutant AGO1s will reveal structural alterations compared to wild-type AGO1. Additionally, the interaction
between AGO1 and poly(A)-specific nuclease (PARN) will be examined to understand the distinct trimming
patterns.
Aim 3: Determine the silencing ability of NDD-AGO2-RISCs loaded with tyRNA (NDD-AGO-tyRISCs). The study
will investigate whether NDD-AGO2 mutants exhibit similar miRNA trimming as NDD-AGO1s and assess the
silencing capability of NDD-AGO2-tyRISCs. Co-localization of NDD-AGO2-tyRISC with AGO-binding proteins
will be analyzed.
Through these aims, the research aims to unravel the mechanisms of target recognition by cityRNAs,
understand tyRNA pathology, and characterize NDD-tyRISCs, which may lay the groundwork for potential
therapeutic applications."

Inflammation underlies the pathogenesis of many chronic lung diseases. Thus, defining mechanisms by which
pulmonary inflammation is regulated and resolved is of high clinical importance. Understanding those
mechanisms is especially relevant to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition that typically
develops following decades of cigarette smoking (CS) and in which repeated respiratory infections are linked to
non-resolving inflammation and can cause disease flares (COPD exacerbations). Lung macrophages are critical
for both initiation and resolution of inflammation, and the control of exacerbations. They can adopt different
phenotypes (i.e., pro-inflammatory or pro-repair) that are characterized by an interplay of transcriptional and
metabolic programming dictating macrophage function and ensuring tissue integrity. We previously
demonstrated that fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) mediates pro-repair macrophage function via interaction
with the nuclear receptor Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor γ (PPARγ) and identified a novel single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs202275, linked with a FABP5 enhancer region and COPD exacerbations.
However, the critical role of the FABP5/PPARg axis and the genetic variation rs202275 (T) in macrophage
phenotypic programming and whether they can be targeted for therapeutic purposes remains unknown. We
propose 3 aims to interrogate the role of the FABP5/PPARg axis in macrophage pro-repair phenotype relying on
1) metabolism, 2) transcription, and 3) function of lung macrophages. This work will provide an in-depth clinically
relevant understanding of the mechanisms by which decreased FABP5 leads to chronic lung inflammation in
COPD exacerbations, identify a novel target to reverse chronic inflammation in COPD, and validate the
repurposing of FDA approved PPARγ agonists used in type 2 diabetes."

Research: Emerging studies have characterized intricate neuro-immune interactions that influence immunity and
tissue homeostasis at various barrier surfaces. Thus, synergistic targeting of neuro-immune pathways may be a
novel therapeutic approach for treating various inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD). My recent study demonstrated that a cholinergic neuropeptide, neuromedin U (NMU), and intestinal tissue-
resident group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) cooperatively regulate the pathogenesis of IBD. However, the
etiology of IBD is highly complex, and patients with extraintestinal inflammation, such as chronic inflammatory
skin diseases, also present gastrointestinal complications and are at increased risk for IBD. Based on my new
preliminary data combined with my recent work, this proposal will investigate the role of NMU and ILC2s in
regulating such skin-gut inflammatory circuits. Completion of proposed studies will allow for the rational design
and development of novel therapeutics and preventative medicine for IBD and other inflammatory diseases.
Career Goals: My overarching career goal is to become an independent investigator at an academic institution
to study novel approaches to harness neuro-immune circuitries to treat inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, I
believe that training future scientists is also an essential aspect of being an independent investigator. Thus, I will
strive to become an inspirational mentor for my future trainees.
Career Development Plan: To successfully transition to independence, I must develop various scientific,
professional, and personal skills, including broadening my expertise in murine models of skin inflammation and
molecular and cellular techniques to modulate neuro-immune interactions in the skin and the intestine. I must
also cultivate collaborations and skills in writing, communicating, mentoring, and laboratory management. In
addition to the support provided by mentors and advisory committee members, I will participate in workshops
and programs led by distinguished scientists at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and the New York Academy of
Sciences to aid in developing skills in specialized experimental techniques and laboratory management.
Career Development Environment: I will conduct the K99 phase of the proposed research in the Artis lab (WCM),
which is located at the heart of the Tri-Institutional campus, comprising the WCM, The Rockefeller, and Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The laboratory has access to all the state-of-art equipment and core facilities
required to complete the experiments proposed in this proposal, including transcriptomic sequencing, optical and
high-throughput imaging, and the animal facility. Lastly, as part of Cornell University, WCM follows the `Open
Doors, Open Hearts, Open Minds' initiatives to improve diversity, inclusion, and accessibility on campus. Their
monthly town hall meetings will be an invaluable resource to ensure equal opportunity for future trainees in my
laboratory. Thus, the WCM campus is an ideal environment for my K99 mentored research training phase."

 This proposal seeks to develop and evaluate a novel culturally tailored family-based videogame, FamilyBond
(FamB), to prevent increases in substance misuse among urban Black mid-adolescents with early substance
use in primary care settings. Compared to white adolescents, Black adolescents who misuse substances are
more likely to die from a drug overdose, with an alarming 86% increase in drug overdose rates in ages 15-24
years from 2019 to 2020. Black adolescents have risk/protective factors for substance misuse that differ from
other racial/ethnic adolescents. Urban Black adolescents differ from rural Black adolescents in their perception
of harm from substances, substance misuse norms, and exposure to community violence, underscoring the
need for tailored interventions. Family-based interventions can address these factors, and digital interventions
can mitigate barriers to intervention access that Black adolescents and their caregivers face, facilitating wide
uptake. However, digital family-based interventions for urban Black adolescents with early substance misuse
are lacking. The scientific objective of this proposal is to apply theoretically and empirically driven approaches
to develop and test FamB, an intervention to prevent increases in substance misuse among Black adolescents.
 Research Aims are: 1) To develop FamB and assess its usability among Black adolescents and parents, 2)
to assess the feasibility and effect size of FamB among 60 Black parent-adolescent (14-17-year-old) dyads in
a) lowering adolescent intention to misuse substances (primary outcome), b) improving parental self-efficacy
regarding parent-adolescent substance misuse communication, and c) improving parent-adolescent

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a complex congenital anomaly where an early embryologic insult
disrupts diaphragmatic and pulmonary development, often resulting in severe, acute cardiopulmonary
dysfunction post-natally and affects 2-4 per 10,000 births in the US, amounting to approximately 1500 children
every year with an annual societal cost approaching $400 million. The CDH Study Group (CDHSG), established
in 1995, is a consortium of institutions dedicated to improving the lives of families/patients affected by CDH
through collaboration, data collation, investigation, and dissemination. Previous trials in CDH suffered limitations
common to many uncommon disease investigative efforts including limited enrollment, prolonged trial conduct,
inflated resource utilization, and suboptimal power, all for unconvincing evidence. The overarching goal of this
multi-institutional initiative is to leverage the strength of collaboration, experienced clinical investigator
leadership, and innovative trial design/analysis to address clinical questions in CDH. An important example is
the use of inhaled Nitric Oxide (iNO) in the postnatal stabilization phase of clinical care in CDH. Despite mounting
evidence concluding that, among patients with CDH, iNO is ineffective (and potentially harmful) and costly, most
clinicians maintain equipoise over its effectiveness, and use remains near universal. Our investigative approach,
a pragmatic, multi-center, de-implementation trial, with a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized design, within the
construct of an established registry, will address the clinical and cost-effectiveness of iNO in CDH. Nineteen
participating centers will de-implement iNO - randomized at the center level. We will include 900 total neonates
with CDH. Our first specific aim is to determine if de-implementation of iNO in the post-natal resuscitation /
stabilization phase affects the composite outcome of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) use and/or mortality
(composite primary outcome), as well as ECLS use, mortality, and/or oxygenation in CDH (secondary outcomes).
Our second specific aim is to establish the cost-effectiveness of de-implementing iNO as a therapy in the post-
natal resuscitation / stabilization phase of CDH management, which will be assessed as the incremental health
system costs (savings) per prevented ECLS use and/or death. Our third specific aim is to evaluate factors that
influence iNO de-implementation at the individual physician and site level to inform strategies to improve de-
implementation throughout the trial. We believe this initiative, including an innovative design and collaborative
approach, will serve as a foundation for ongoing trials in CDH and will serve as pivotal example for advancing
the adoption of cost-effective, evidence-based strategies in neonatal and pediatric care."
10985971,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 I am an implementation scientist, youth substance use and mental health services researcher, clinical
psychologist, and descendant of Okinawan-Japanese immigrants to Hawaiʻi. I propose to use a community-
based participatory research approach to study the implementation of a culturally grounded substance use
prevention curriculum, Ho`ouna Pono. The intervention has been created, evaluated, and spread through
several NIDA-funded grants to address the high rates of substance use in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander
youth, especially in rural areas. Our work has revealed that many implementation barriers intersect at the
youth, family, and teacher levels, indicating a pressing need for community-led implementation efforts. In this
Racial Equity Initiative Visionary Award, I propose an innovative combination of implementation science and
participatory methods to spread and sustain Ho`ouna Pono in the Windward District of the Hawaiʻi State
Department of Education. I hypothesize that Ho`ouna Pono adoption and sustainability will increase by using
community-led innovation tournaments, which actively promote engagement and ownership in the
implementation process. I also hypothesize that real-time assessments of implementation through ecological
momentary assessment will enable rapid and accurate implementation and intervention adaptation. These two
innovative approaches have never been tested for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander youth living in
geographically remote and rural areas, making this a novel high-risk, high-reward study. Moreover, this is the
first study to use ecological momentary assessment to facilitate implementation of youth substance use
prevention.
 I intend to challenge the existing research paradigm through this Racial Equity Initiative Visionary
Award through redistributing power to community to lead the research effort. Traditionally, implementation
science and research has privileged the researchers' voice, often leading to highly controlled, community-based
studies that create mistrust in the scientific process and produce unsustainable interventions with limited
community acceptability. These concerns are even more pronounced in populations that have systematically
been the focus of increased scientific inquiry, like indigenous and rural populations. The impact of this
paradigm-shifting project has the potential to change how implementation research is conducted by putting
community in the leadership role. Furthermore, it will build scientific skills and expertise directly into the
community to foster ongoing implementation and generalizability toward future implementation efforts. It is
imperative that studies with the potential for reshaping institutional structures and systems be conducted to
further advance racial equity, especially for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander youth. The proposed study
addresses this imperative."
10927428,"Non-human primates (NHP) such as baboon, cynomolgus macaque, rhesus macaque, and vervet are susceptible to the same age-related health challenges and diseases as humans. The overall aging trajectory in NHP is also influenced by stressors and lifestyle similar to humans. Research in NHP allows for controlled environments, providing longitudinal data with less “noise” than in human studies. The genetic, metabolic and physiologic similarities between NHP and humans make findings in NHP directly translatable to our understanding of human disease processes, including genetic predispositions and early molecular indicators of these processes. In the R21 phase of this project, we will 1) harmonize existing samples and data in four NHP species that can be leveraged to better understand molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human aging, and 2) implement the Monkey Inventory and Data management of Samples (MIDAS), a LabKey Server data management system, for integration of omic data and pedigree data with clinical and research data from Aim 1. In the subsequent R33 phase, we will demonstrate the unique value of this harmonized, comparative cross- species resource for aging studies using integrated omics and clinical measures to quantify aging in liver and plasma across the lifespan in these four NHP. We will 1) determine the biological age trajectory for each NHP species from multiple chronological ages that capture human equivalent 18-80 years, by measuring molecules known to reflect biological age including gene expression, DNA methylation, and proteins in liver samples (n=48 for each species (F, 24; M,24)); and 2) identify circulating molecular signatures that correlate with liver specific signatures of aging that precede clinical markers of aging common to the four NHP species Alignment and harmonization of data and samples for these four NHP cohorts will provide a critical resource translating discoveries to humans, and supporting interdisciplinary studies of aging across the lifespan."
10746466,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of prematurity and is the leading respiratory cause of childhood morbidity. BPD results in a significant burden to families and increased health care utilization. In the United States alone BPD accounts for over $2.4 billion in healthcare costs annually.  Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) an accepted and important contributor to BPD.  Exposure to oxygen and positive pressure ventilation leads to developmental arrest and parenchymal injury in the immature preterm lung. Because even brief exposure to positive pressure ventilation is injurious, avoiding invasive intubated mechanical ventilation is the most widely acknowledged strategy to prevent VILI and the long-term sequela of BPD.  Therefore, time on ventilators and rates of successful extubation are important endpoints of therapy.  Lung protective strategies prioritize non-invasive respiratory support for preterm infants with respiratory failure, but failure rates of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy are high.  In meta-analysis of available trials, both synchronized and non-synchronized non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) are superior to CPAP for preventing extubation failure in preterm infants.  A stronger effect size was observed for synchronized NIPPV vs. CPAP than for non-synchronized NIPPV vs. CPAP.  However, until recently no FDA-approved reliable methods to provide synchronized NIPPV for preterm infants were available in the US  Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA), an FDA approved technology, is a novel method to synchronize ventilatory support with infant respiratory drive. This effective non-invasive synchronization matches electrical diaphragmatic activity to deliver synchronized and accurate tidal volumes in proportion to the neural signal.  To date, the clinical impact of non-invasive NAVA (NIV-NAVA) on clinical outcomes in preterm infants has not been established.  In these clustered UG3/UH3 and U24 applications, we propose a pragmatic, unblinded, phase III clinical trial in 478 extremely preterm infants of 24 0/7- 27 6/7 weeks gestational age to determine if NIV-NAVA, compared with non-synchronized NIPPV, prevents extubation failure within 5 days of extubation from mechanical ventilation."
10925413,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT - OVERALL
The Penn State Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) was formed in 2007 to accelerate the impact
of biomedical research on health. Penn State has almost $1 billion in research expenditures, and its College of
Medicine (CoM) and Penn State Health system serve about 2.0 million people in largely rural regions of central

The unique biospecimens and data from the Developmental GTEx (dGTEx) project create an exciting
opportunity and need for novel methods development. In this project, we propose to develop a set of statistical
methods and analytical approaches that are designed to extract insights into human and non-human primate
development from the multi-modal and multi-tissue data from dGTEx post-mortem donors. Analysis of the
dGTEx data requires statistical models that can take advantage of the rich structure and diversity of the data
across ages and modalities, while addressing some of the inherent challenges. Models explicitly informed by
age can capture developmental trajectories of gene regulation, genetic effects, and tissue structure. The range
of data modalities also creates an opportunity for novel methods to capture additional effects and improved
resolution at the cell-type, isoform, and structural levels. However, these data are also inherently complex,
representing a mixture of cell types along with biological and technical noise. The ambitious study design of
dGTEx also comes with challenges of donor recruitment that limit sample size. The methods proposed here
are designed to leverage the benefits of temporal multi-modal data, while addressing data complexity and
limited sample size. In our first aim, we will analyze transcriptome variation across the human lifespan, with
improved transcript annotation and new methods to characterize how gene expression, alternative splicing and
cell type composition change during development and how they contribute in driving phenotypic change.
Secondly, we will use multi-modal data from GTEx to capture changes in gene regulatory networks during
development. From the dGTEx histology images and spatial transcriptomics data we will model developmental
trajectories of tissue structures, and describe their molecular characteristics as well as role in disease. In our
third aim we will map and characterize genetic regulatory variation in dGTEx and apply predictive models for
improved predictions of regulatory variants in pediatric tissues. In addition to empowering biological discovery,
this work has the potential to uncover disease risk factors and mechanisms that originate or manifest during
early life."
10993530,"ABSTRACT (from Parent Grant)
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer and, despite advances in treatment, it
is still one of the leading causes of childhood death in the United States (US), and survivors face significant
lifelong treatment-related morbidities. Children of Latino ethnicity have the highest and fastest-increasing risk of
ALL in the US, and have lower survival than non-Latino whites; however, this ethnic disparity in incidence and
outcome is not fully understood. Elucidating the increased risk of ALL in Latino children may reveal novel insights
in the etiology of ALL in both Latino and non-Latino populations, and may highlight potential avenues for disease
prevention. We hypothesize that germline genetic variation plays an essential role in the increased ALL risk in
Latinos, that this risk is imparted via Native American ancestry, and that ALL risk alleles were selected in Native
Americans during European colonization of the Americas due to their beneficial effects on immune response to
new infections. We have assembled the largest ever case-control set of childhood ALL in Latinos, including over
5,400 cases and 27,000 controls from three independent studies in California, plus studies in Texas, Children’s
Oncology Group/St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, and Guatemala. In our first aim, we will perform three
complementary approaches to discover novel common risk loci associated with childhood ALL: i) a genome-
wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis, ii) admixture mapping to capitalize on the recently admixed
nature of Latino genomes, and iii) a transcriptome-wide association study to identify novel loci and to pinpoint
causal genes at known and novel risk regions. In our second aim, we will characterize the genetic variants in
terms of their association with local Native American ancestry and whether they exhibit evidence of directional
natural selection on the Native American branch of the human population tree. We will also characterize the
aggregate effects of common variants on childhood ALL risk and how this varies by ethnicity, via comprehensive
modeling of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for ALL in Latinos and in non-Latino whites. Finally, we will incorporate
our genetic findings into epidemiologic analyses, by accounting for common (PRS) genetic variants in ALL risk
models for immune-related risk factors in Latinos and non-Latino whites, including cesarean delivery and in utero
cytomegalovirus infection, both of which have shown stronger effects on ALL risk in Latinos and are potentially
modifiable risk factors. The results of this study will shed light on the etiology of childhood ALL in general and of
the increased risk of ALL in Latino children, which will help to alleviate this ethnic disparity and may inform future
approaches for childhood leukemia prevention."
10993536,"Our lab is dedicated to the mechanistic understanding of macromolecular function through the visualization of
structure, dynamics, and regulatory interactions. Towards that goal, we use cryo-EM, together with biochemical
and biophysical assays. Our areas of study are centered on the characterization of the regulatory molecular
mechanisms governing the function of microtubules and of human transcription/epigenetic complexes.
Microtubules (MTs) are essential polymers in eukaryotic cells built of ab-tubulin dimers. Dynamic instability, the
switching between growing and shrinking phases due to the coupling of the assembly process to the exchange
and hydrolysis of GTP in b-tubulin, is an essential property for MT function. Many MT cellular partners
modulate MT dynamics or utilize it to carry out specific functions. In the last 5 years, we confirmed and
complemented our past studies, which used non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs to characterize conformational
changes in MTs that accompany GTP hydrolysis, now using of GTP-hydrolysis tubulin mutants. We also
defined the mode of binding and action of cellular factors that regulate MT assembly, dynamics and
organization in the cell and described the effect of tubulin acetylation on MT structure and function. We will
continue this work with the central theme of adding complexity to our studies in order to bring us closer to the
regulated function of microtubule cellular systems as we also add techniques complementary to our major tool,
cryo-EM.
Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is critical for growth and survival, and of obvious significance to
human health. Its initiation involves RNA polymerase II (Pol II) together with TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF,
and TFIIH. Regulation is achieved by sequence-specific activators or repressors, co-factors, and chromatin
remodeling/modifying complexes. During the last funding period we defined the structures of human TFIID and
TFIIH, as well as other large transcriptional coactivators like the human SAGA, and the yeast NuA4 and RSC
complexes. We will now characterize the human TIP60 complex, the binding of transcriptional co-activators to
chromatin substrates, and pursue the dynamic visualization of TFIID engagement with promoter DNA to gain
further knowledge of how these complexes work in the nucleus to regulate gene expression.
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is an epigenetic gene silencer that methylates lysine 27 of histone H3
and is essential for cellular differentiation and development. After obtaining the structure of human PRC2 with
its cofactors JARID2 and AEBP2 and its interaction with a di-nucleosome, we have now defined how PRC2
recognizes mono-ubiquitylated nucleosome, the substrate created by the other major Polycomb complex,
PRC1. We will now further characterize the regulatory landscape of PRC2 looking into other histone
modifications, different forms of PRC2 (i.e., other cofactors), the role of PRC2 auto-methylation, and binding of
PRC2 to RNA"

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, with the number of cases estimated to rise to 13
million by 2050 in the US alone
. While amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau are known to be the key neuropathological
hallmarks of the disease, imaging and postmortem studies highlight significant variability in disease severity and
progression even in subjects with similar burdens of Aβ and tau accumulation. This uncertainty in the trajectory
of disease progression results in substantial challenges for patients and their families in understanding disease
prognosis, as well as the research community in understanding heterogeneity in the rate of Aβ and tau
accumulation, cognitive decline and likelihood of progressing to dementia. Building upon prior work from our
group and others, we will develop a prognostic score, termed the Tau Progression Index (TPI), a multi-
component and multimodal measure that can predict tau accumulation, neurodegeneration,
and cognitive/functional decline. Two components of the TPI are based on MRI measures of structural and
functional connectivity that have been shown in recent reports to explain the rate and pattern of spread of tau
pathology. The other two components are based on regional patterns and interactions between Aβ and tau
accumulation in the early stages of AD. For instance, a recent report by our group highlights the importance of
co-localized (overlapping) and non-co-localized accumulation of Aβ and tau in predicting conversion from
cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and/or AD.
In this project, we will recruit 130 non-demented participants with evidence of Aβ and tau pathologies based on
18F-florbetaben and 18F-MK6240 PET scans from 10 ongoing NIH-funded studies with more than 1700 planned
and 650+ existing enrollments. Our laboratory serves as a central neuroimaging processing hub for these 10
NIH studies, allowing us a unique opportunity to identify subjects with PET-confirmed evidence of AD pathology
at no additional cost. These selected subjects will then undergo our advanced MRI acquisition protocol and
processing pipeline to extract reliable subject-specific functional and structural connectivity. Subjects will also
undergo detailed cognitive and clinical assessments. Subjects will be evaluated at baseline and at a 2.5-year
follow-up visit, which will include Aβ and tau PET, our advanced MRI and clinical/cognitive assessment. By
combining subject-specific structural and functional connectomes with the patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation,
our developed TPI will give a single prognostic score for each individual. We aim to show that this score
will predict the trajectory of tau spread and disease progression. By incorporating spatial/network-based patterns
of tau deposition and brain connectomes into a prognostic tool for patient counseling and clinical trials, our TPI
is an important step towards personalized medicine for AD."
11000108,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cell death pathways play a central role in several biological processes—from programmed cell death during
the early stages of development to destroying infected cells that serve as niches for pathogens, such as
bacteria. Thus, proper cell death is critical to multiple biological processes and diseases and must be precisely
regulated and coordinated. The processes that regulate cell death pathways are not well defined, and this gap
in knowledge limits the ability to design targeted treatment and prevention strategies for diseases that result
when cell death is dysregulated.
A critical regulatory point for several cell death pathways is receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase
1 (RIPK1), which serves as a pivotal decision point for several cell death and inflammatory pathways. Our lab
has performed foundational studies on RIPK1, identifying this protein as a regulator of caspase-8-dependent
gasdermin D activation and inflammasome-mediated responses following exposure to the bacteria Yersinia.
Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen in Yersinia-infected primary macrophages, we identified putative
regulators of RIPK1/caspase-8-induced cytotoxicity, including the splicing factors Raver1 and Ptbp1, which
were among the top five hits. These identified splicing factors are potential regulators of RIPK1, and elucidating
their mechanism of action will be an important advance in understanding cell death and inflammation.
We generated Raver1-/- mice and cell lines, and our studies indicate that Raver1 and Ptbp1 promote canonical
RNA splicing of the RIPK1 kinase domain. We hypothesize that Raver1 and Ptbp1 control the splicing of
RIPK1 and determine the potency of cell death and inflammation signals. In Aim 1, we will determine the roles
of Raver1 and Ptbp1 on RIPK1/caspase-8 mediated cytotoxicity and inflammation by examining macrophages
and other cells deficient in Raver1 or Ptbp1. In Aim 2, we will define how Raver1, Ptbp1, and other factors
influence RIPK1 by examining how these factors control the splicing, expression and nonsense-mediated
decay of RIPK1. In Aim 3, we will assess the impact of Raver1 splicing on cytotoxicity and inflammation in vivo
to test the hypothesis that the absence of Raver1 profoundly alters host resistance to infection and
inflammation using our Raver1-/- mouse line.
This proposal will address an essential gap in knowledge by elucidating how a central node in multiple cell
death pathways is regulated. The completion of these aims will establish novel roles of Raver1 and Ptbp1 in
regulating key inflammatory and cytotoxic responses and enable novel targeted strategies to prevent and treat
diseases that result from dysregulation in cell death pathways."

HCHS/SOL and SOL-INCA studies have large samples of diverse and representative Latinos, including those of
Mexican, Puerto Rican, Central American, Cuban and Dominican origin. Over 14-years of longitudinal
cognitive and functional assessments, plasma Amyloid Tau Neurodegeneration (ATN) biomarkers,
neuroimaging, deep behavioral and cardiometabolic phenotyping, and multi-layered `omics, these study data
provide fertile resources for new scientists of diverse cultural and disciplinary backgrounds to stimulate and
produce new brain aging science on diverse Latino groups facing excess ADRD disease burden. This conference
series will create a unique space for bringing leading and aspiring scientists together to work on high-priority
scientific areas, including methodological, behavioral, social and neuroscientific ADRD-related topics.
Conference participants will learn about the “state of the science” of Latino cognitive aging, and the “state of
the data” by hearing about existing studies in the topic areas. They will also learn the “state of the methods”
necessary to address complex study designs, meet with leaders in these respective fields, and have the
opportunity to apply their understanding by developing new research questions for manuscripts and novel
specific aims for grant proposals. The conference series will result in a measurable increase in the scientific

11001857,"Cervical cancer (CxCa) stands as a significant cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally.
Specifically, in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), comprising Cameron, Hidalgo, Willacy, and Starr counties, the
highest CxCa mortality in the U.S. has been identified. The initiation of HPV infection represents a pivotal event
in the malignant transformation of the cervical zone, established as the primary cause leading from intraepithelial
lesions to CxCa. The most prevalent cytopathologic manifestations of cervical HPV infection are low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions situated in the cervix's transformation zone. The prevalence of HPV infection
and its various genotypes differs significantly worldwide. Different populations may harbor distinct HPV
genotypes within their genital tracts. Nevertheless, factors such as high poverty rates, poor nutrition, unknown
environmental influences, socio-behavioral elements, and limited education along the Mexican border might also
significantly contribute to this health disparity. Understanding the disease pathology and devising new
approaches to combat it in specific populations necessitates crucial information regarding HPV prevalence, HPV
genotypes, and the frequency of HPV 16 E6 genomic variance among women from diverse populations, along
with their associations with socio-behavioral factors. However, this vital information, concerning either HPV
prevalence or the distribution of HPV types, remains unavailable for RGV women, who are profoundly affected
by CxCa. Consequently, we propose investigations to gather this critical information regarding RGV women. We
believe this knowledge will be immensely valuable in mitigating the CxCa disparity among this highly
underserved population. Our hypothesis posits that analyzing HPV genotype prevalence, frequency of HPV
16 E6 genomic variants, and immunological factors will illuminate the cause of CxCa disparity in RGV
women. In aim 1, we will determine the prevalence of HPV infection and identify the specific HPV types of
present. This analysis will involve cervical mucosa samples collected from women in rural RGV. Samples from
Caucasian women will also be analyzed for comparison. In aim 2, we propose investigating the existence of Ig
types (representing the humoral response), cytokines (representing the cellular response), and genetic
polymorphisms within immune response genes in cervical mucosa samples. Aim 3, achieved using PDX mouse
models of HPV16 E6 variants, is designed to explore the frequency and incidence of different HPV16 E6 genomic
variants, investigating their oncogenic, metastatic potential, and role in drug resistance, all contributing to the
aggressiveness of the disease and poor therapeutic outcomes of CxCa. The outcomes of this study will be
instrumental in developing innovative prevention and therapeutic strategies to alleviate the CxCa disparity among
the RGV Hispanic women population."

patient outcomes, develop management strategies, and reduce health disparities. 4) To challenge and stimulate
the scientific interests of trainees, attracting a new generation of junior investigators into the field of sarcoidosis.
The AASOG 2024 Planning Committee has identified outstanding thought leaders in sarcoidosis as well as
selected experts from outside the field to achieve the mission of improving the collective clinical and scientific
approach to sarcoidosis. Each session will consist of several presentations followed by dedicated time for
discussion to stimulate collaboration and innovation. A major thematic focus of the conference is addressing
health disparities in sarcoidosis through a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach. The program aims to achieve
this by continuing AASOG’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity with conference faculty including
approximately 50% women, 20% from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, 17% early career faculty, 17%
non-physician team members, including 4 patients. Participation of trainees and junior faculty is facilitated by an
oral abstract session, poster sessions, and a clinical case discussion session. Networking and collaboration
opportunities will include meal and coffee breaks, a structured speed mentoring event, a dinner reception and a
breakout group session. The conference will conclude with a high-level summary and review of the impact and
common themes from the conference to identify key future directions for basic, translational, and clinical research
in sarcoidosis. Attendees will receive Continuing Medical Education credit and can attend in person or virtually
to facilitate participation and dissemination of knowledge in the field."

The delivery of small molecules, proteins and biological drugs, nucleic acids, and other molecular therapies
relies on the site of the disease-causing target within the body and is highly dependent on the ability to manage
solubility, stability, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetics of the drug. The Drug Carriers for Medicine and
Biology Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and its accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) provide
key platforms for discussion and dissemination of critical developments in the design of drug delivery systems
to meet the many unique challenges of this field. Addressing these issues requires an interdisciplinary
approach that engages researchers in basic biology and physiology, chemistry, and physics that inform design
as well as engineering and clinical perspectives. The GRC provides a unique environment that successfully
brings these groups together to discuss and debate fundamental questions about delivery and to share new
innovations in the field. The specific aims of this GRC/GRS are: 1) to provide a forum for discussion of the key
barriers to delivery and physiological understanding to inform carrier design, 2) to facilitate discussion in an
intellectually and culturally diverse environment, 3) to discuss new innovations and cutting-edge research, and
4) to create opportunities for early career investigators to build relationships and partnerships for professional
advancement. These aims will be accomplished via a carefully curated program describing cutting edge
research, elongated discussion sessions following each talk, four poster sessions to highlight research from
early career investigators, and social events to facilitate idea exchange and networking. The subtitle for the
2024 GRC in Drug Carriers for Medicine and Biology is: “Drug Carrier Design for Cell and Tissue Specific
Delivery”. Areas of focus include lipid nanoparticle-mediated delivery, therapeutic carriers for reproductive
health, biomaterials, immunoengineering-enabling delivery systems, nanosystems, cell and tissue-selective
delivery, and sensing. The GRS that precedes the GRC enables graduate students and postdoctoral
researchers to examine the field and address important questions from their own perspectives as early
investigators while also providing important networking opportunities. Speakers will be selected from research
trainees across a broad range of institutions and disciplines. The 2024 GRS theme, which is “Trafficking,
targeting, and tropism-based strategies for the localization of drug carriers”, will provide a forum for discussion
that connects ongoing laboratory research with issues that might ultimately determine translational success,
such as off-targeting. The GRS will also feature a plenary speaker who will provide a deep perspective on this
question and discussion leaders chosen to provide background and perspective during the discussions."

Point of Care Diagnostics for Liver Disease using Fluorescent Nanosensors
 Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis is a major driver of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Rapid diagnosis of liver
fibrosis is crucial to optimizing patient outcome and minimizing economic impact of this disease. Current
strategies for detecting liver damage (fibrosis/cirrhosis) use biomarker and mechanical strategies that are
expensive and difficult to translate into Point of Care (PoC) platforms. Robust PoC liver diagnostics would
enable regular monitoring of chemotherapy patients and game-changing diagnostics for the developing world.
In preliminary studies we have demonstrated that polymer-based sensor arrays on paper substrates can
generate serum ‘signatures’ that can diagnose liver fibrosis with clinical relevance. In our proposed research
we will build on this foundation to create effective lateral flow device (LFD) diagnostics for liver fibrosis. In our
multi-pronged strategy, we will:
Aim 1: Synthesize engineered polymer conjugates (Rotello) and use these as sensor elements to provide
 multi-channel outputs serum sensing. Protein/serum selectivity will be guided by integration of
 synthesis (Rotello) with computational/machine learning tools (Van Lehn) in a feedback-driven cycle.
 Thesse studies will be performed in solution to facilitate sensor optimization.
Aim 2: Fabricate LFD devices and immobilize polymers downselected from Aim 1 onto surfaces to provide
 prototype sensing systems suitable for PoC use. (Rotello) These sensors will be tested and optimized
 using model sera generated by spiking healthy serum.
Aim 3: Apply LFDs downselected from Aim 2 to profile liver fibrosis using pathological samples and liver
 diagnostics insight provided by Rosenberg and Peveler. These studies will focus on detection and
 staging of liver fibrosis, using statistical methods developed by C. Rotello.
Aim 4: Effective sensor systems identified in Aim 3 will be explored using proteomics by Vachet. These
 studies characterize protein binding to the polymer sensors, providing insight into how the sensor works
 and potentially new biomarkers for fibrosis.
 The key driver of the proposed research is the development of PoC systems for diagnosis of liver fibrosis;
effective achievement of this goal would provide strategies that could be translated to numerous disease
states. The focus on polymer-protein affinity and selectivity will provide new insight into fundamental aspects of
these interactions, and the integration of machine learning into this process will develop new polymer design
strategies biomedical applications."
10981719,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a common, disabling disorder among adolescents, interfering
with their schoolwork, physical and social development. It occurs most often in adolescent females post-
menarche. The combination of orthostatic symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, weakness, or brain fog
with a 40 bpm rise in heart rate in the first 10 minutes of a tilt table test without a drop in blood pressure
defines the disorder. Two striking and nearly universal features of POTS are (1) its onset after a major
threat such as an infection or trauma and (2) its association with many co-morbid disorders such as
migraine headache, fibromyalgia, functional gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, and
others that commonly fall under the classification of chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPC).
Although we and others have repeatedly reported these curious associations, no study or
pathophysiologic theory has attempted to include either of these observations in a model for the
fundamental etiology of POTS. Here we propose that the brain region responsible for the orchestration of
“life or death” response to an acute major threat, the periaqueductal gray region (PAG) in the midbrain,
does not properly reset after a threat has passed (explaining the observation that POTS onset follows a
threat) and continues in a chronic state of threat readiness. We further hypothesize that this chronic
state impacts the two major areas of known control by the PAG: cardiovascular autonomic regulation,
resulting in POTS, and pain signaling from end-organs, resulting in COPC’s. Such PAG dysregulation
likely occurs through the vagus nerve, known to be abnormal in POTS. We will test this hypothesis in 3
aims comparing 60 adolescent and young adult females with POTS to 60 healthy female subjects, 40 of
whom will just had an infection severe enough for a hospital admission. In aim 1, we will study the natural
history to understand whether POTS and COPC’s flare simultaneously and are typically associated with
a preceding identifiable threat, and whether the healthy controls after infection develop any limited
symptoms of POTS or COPC that eventually recede. In aim 2 we will image the PAG both at rest and
during a “looming threat task” which probes the PAG’s responsiveness to threat. We expect the PAG to
be more threat-responsive in the POTS subjects and in the healthy subjects immediately in the wake of
the infection compared to subjects without POTS or recent infection. Aim 3 will consist of assessing
cardiovascular vagal function through heart rate variability (HRV). We expect that more severe POTS
subjects will show lower HRV in association with greater PAG threat readiness, and that changes in PAG
threat readiness will be associated with changes in HRV. This project is the first proposal of a unifying
hypothesis explaining all the major features of POTS, and the potential for new treatment approaches."
10981752,"Polymicrobial infections involving fungal and bacterial pathogens are increasingly common among hospitalized
patients. However, there is a paucity of research focused on studying polymicrobial infections. The fungal
pathogen Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive fungal infection and the third most common
cause of nosocomial bloodstream infections in the US. Invasive fungal infections with C. albicans have
devastatingly high mortality rates compared with bacterial infections. Bloodstream fungal infections, which are
mostly monomicrobial, result in a 40% mortality rate. In contrast, intra-abdominal fungal infections (IAI), which
are often polymicrobial involving both fungal and bacterial species, result in a 50-75% mortality rate, which far
exceeds bacterial mono- or polymicrobial IAI mortality rates (20%). Fungal involvement also leads to increased
rates of relapse and more severe disease scores. The mechanisms associated with this exacerbated mortality
are currently unknown. The objective of this proposal is to delineate host and microbial mechanisms contributing
to synergistic lethality during polymicrobial fungal-bacterial IAI. Our central hypothesis is that polymicrobial
fungal–bacterial IAIs promote synergistic effects on mortality induced by microbe-microbe interactions that
increase bacterial toxin production, leading to upregulation of immune signaling pathways, dysregulation of
hemostasis and coagulation, and altered bone marrow remodeling. This hypothesis will be tested by modeling
polymicrobial interactions with C. albicans and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which is
the most commonly co-isolated bacterial pathogen from fungal-bacterial co-infections. The first specific aim of
this project is to interrogate the mechanisms by which Candida induces of S. aureus toxin production during
polymicrobial IAI. The second specific aim will define bacterial mechanisms and virulence regulators that drive
dysregulated hemostasis and coagulation that contribute to lethality during polymicrobial IAI. The third specific
aim will functionally characterize the consequences of Candida-induced S. aureus toxin production on bone
marrow homeostasis and trained innate immunity. Completion of this project will identify both new mechanisms
that underlie exacerbated pathogenicity of polymicrobial infections and therapeutic approaches to improve
outcomes of IAI."
10988558,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a highly-prevalent form of skin cancer with an estimated 1.8M
new diagnoses annually in the United States alone. While typically less aggressive than many other forms of
cancer, this high prevalence still results in significant levels of mortality, including approximately 15,000 deaths
each year in the U.S. This mortality risk combined with the large volume of cSCC cases creates a tremendous
need for optimizing treatment escalation strategies, so that patients at risk for poor outcomes can benefit from
more aggressive treatments while low-risk patients can be spared the corresponding side effects and costs.
Here, we propose to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to predict cSCC prognosis and ultimately aid
in treatment selection. The models will be trained and validated using a unique dataset of 1,360 cSCC tumors
with corresponding histopathology slides, clinical outcomes, and labels for known risk factors. The
histopathology whole slide images will be used as model input, where we propose a curriculum learning
strategy to mitigate overfitting while training in a weakly-supervised, multiple instance learning fashion. We will
first develop models to predict the presence of known risk factors, including poor differentiation, desmoplasia,
and the invasion of certain histologic structures. While these factors have been shown to correlate with poor
prognosis, they are challenging to consistently detect in clinical practice. Next, we will develop AI models to
directly predict prognosis, exploring the potential of these models to identify prognostic biomarkers not
previously identified. We will subsequently validate the performance of these models and use interpretability
techniques to investigate the features learned. This validation includes a clinical integration simulation study,
where the risk predictions of the AI models will be compared to the retrospective use of adjuvant therapy in
clinical practice. Altogether, accomplishment of this proposal would serve as initial steps in reducing the burden
of a disease that affects millions of patients per year, while developing methods to address common challenges
in computational pathology and especially the important task of prognosis prediction."
10988734,"Multiple BTB-ZF family transcription factors are essential for immune system development and/or essential
immune system functions. Some BTB-ZF transcription factors function, essentially, as “toggle switches” that
control key decision points during development. For example, the commitment of lymphocytes into the T or B
cell lineage requires LRF and commitment to the CD4 or CD8 T cell lineage requires ThPOK. Loss of
expression of the necessary BTB-ZF gene results in loss of cell lineage identify and dedifferentiation. Other
BTB-ZF family members control essential or unique effector functions of lymphocytes. Zbtb20, for example,
defines the function of natural IL-10 producing Tregs that are necessary for intestinal homeostasis. Bcl6 is
required for both the development of T follicular helper cells and germinal center B cells and Zbtb32 is required
for the proliferative burst of NK cells in response to viruses.
In this application, we show that the function of PLZF, the BTB-ZF transcription that controls the phenotype
and innate like effector functions of invariant natural killer (NKT) cells, requires Yin Yang 1 (YY1). YY1 is a
multi-faceted transcriptional regulator that belongs to the Polycomb protein family. YY1 is ubiquitously
expressed and is important for multiple, diverse biological processes. YY1 functions to regulate gene
transcription directly, via chromatin modifications, via direct interactions with other transcription factors and
even by impacting higher order functions such as by 3D chromatin looping or phase separation.
The goal of this application is to discriminate between different possible mechanisms by which YY1 controls
PLZF. In doing so, we anticipate that we will significantly advance the understanding of the regulation of BTB-
ZF master regulator transcription factors. We anticipate that we will also learn more about how the ubiquitously
expressed, multi-faceted transcription regulator YY1 controls discrete biological functions in different cell types.
Advances in these areas would fill substantial knowledge gaps and have the potential to impact both the
understanding of immune responses and, most likely, other biological systems where BTB-ZF genes play
important roles.
Overall, our application seeks to understand how a lineage specific transcription factor (PLZF) is controlled by
a ubiquitously expressed co-factor (YY1) resulting in lymphocyte subset discrete effector functions."
10978803,"Our long-term goal is to determine how cholinergic signaling drives adaptive sound processing in the auditory
midbrain and how this computational flexibility is altered in auditory gating disorders, hearing loss, and aging.
As the midbrain link between the auditory brainstem and forebrain, the inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical
processing center that influences which auditory information gets presented to the forebrain. Computations in
the IC are modulated by cholinergic projections from brainstem cholinergic systems, including a dense
projection from the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT). PPT neurons convey information about states of
arousal, rewards, and the salience of sensory stimuli, including sounds. While previous in vivo studies have
shown that cholinergic drugs elicit diverse effects on IC neurons and that cholinergic signaling can drive
plasticity in the IC, the cellular and synaptic logic of cholinergic modulation in the IC have remained largely
unknown. This gap in knowledge has persisted due to the technical obstacles created by the diversity of
neuron types and convergence of ascending and descending pathways in the IC. This is a critical gap in
knowledge because understanding how cholinergic signaling influences specific populations of IC neurons and
their synaptic inputs is a prerequisite to understanding how cholinergic signaling links changes in internal and
external states to changes in auditory processing. We have recently overcome previous obstacles to progress
by developing molecular genetic techniques to label and manipulate specific populations of IC neurons and
their sources of synaptic input. Based on our past and preliminary data, the current proposal tests the overall
hypothesis that the effects of cholinergic signaling in the IC are largely determined by two factors: (1) the
muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors expressed in specific populations of IC neurons and their
synaptic inputs and (2) the subcellular location and timing of acetylcholine release. We propose four aims to
test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we use pharmacology and patch clamp recordings targeted to fluorescently
labeled populations of IC neurons to determine cellular mechanisms of cholinergic signaling in distinct
populations of excitatory and inhibitory IC neurons. In Aim 2, we combine optogenetic circuit mapping with
pharmacology and patch clamp recordings to determine how muscarinic signaling modulates specific sources
of synaptic input to the IC. In Aim 3, we use electron microscopy to identify ultrastructural relationships
between cholinergic boutons and IC neurons. In Aim 4, we use two-photon Ca2+ imaging in awake mice to
determine how and when cholinergic axons from the PPT respond to auditory stimuli. The proposed studies
will provide a functional and ultrastructural map of how cholinergic signaling alters excitability in distinct
populations of IC neurons and their synaptic inputs. The fundamental insights gained will be essential to
guiding and interpreting future in vivo and behavioral investigations into cholinergic effects on auditory
processing in the IC in normal and disordered conditions."
10978804,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a degenerative disease of the joint. It has been
challenging to manage and treat TMJOA due to our limited understanding of the molecular, cellular, and neuronal
mechanisms underlying TMJOA. The goal of this proposal is to use multi-modal single-cell and imaging
technologies to establish a high-dimensional, comprehensive molecular, cellular, and innervation map of TMJ
under healthy and OA conditions in mouse models that mimic human TMJOA. We will further validate Netrin-
1/Dcc as the potential therapeutic target of TMJOA. A major strength of this collaborative project is to integrate
the findings, skills, and distinct expertise of investigators including PI Jianfu Chen (Neuroscience), co-Is Mildred
Embree and Yang Chai (Craniofacial biology and TMJOA), collaborator Xu Cao (Neuroskeletal pain) and Hu
Zhao (TESOS volume imaging), which cannot otherwise be accomplished by the individual investigators
separately. Strong published and preliminary studies support comprehensive team of scientific approaches in
unveiling the mechanisms of TMJOA, including different TMJOA mouse models, methodology for joint pain
behavior, dynamic changes in joint pathologies and innervation during OA, 3-D imaging methods to map sensory
nerve connectome in the TMJ at micron resolution, antegrade and retrograde tracing of joint innervation,
chemogenetic functional assays of neural circuits, and single cell RNA-sequencing approaches. Importantly, our
preliminary studies have identified Netrin-1/Dcc as key mediators of TMJ cell-cell interaction and potential
therapeutic targets for mitigating TMJOA pain. These exciting preliminary data put us in a unique position to
generate the first comprehensive molecular, cellular, and innervation map of TMJ with or without OA and to
identify new therapeutic targets. Our guiding hypothesis is that TMJOA causes significant alterations in chromatin
accessibility and gene expression of disease relevant cell types including osteoclasts and synovial fibroblasts in
TMJ, which in turn cause maladaptive nociceptive innervation leading to joint pain and degeneration. To test our
hypothesis, we will: (1) create a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic cell atlas for the TMJ
in TMJOA model mice and identify molecular changes that accompany TMJOA in each cell type. (2) functionally
map TMJ nociceptive innervation during OA progression. (3) validate Netrin-1/Dcc as mediators and therapeutic
targets of TMJOA pain."
10978333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acamprosate and naltrexone are major medications used in the treatment of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
However, response to treatment with these drugs is variable, with only ~50% of patients achieving optimal
outcomes. As a result, it would be important to identify molecular mechanisms underlying individual variation in
AUD drug treatment outcomes. That information could potentially facilitate the development of individualized
AUD pharmacotherapy regimens as well as the development of novel AUD therapeutic agents. During the
current funding cycle, we performed a series of “Pharmaco-Omic” studies designed to identify biomarkers
associated with acamprosate response for AUD patients enrolled in our Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized
Treatment of Alcohol Dependence (CITA) clinical trial—one of the largest acamprosate AUD clinical trials
and one for which we have generated a series of multiple omics datasets. Using those data, we identified
novel biomarkers associated with variation in acamprosate treatment outcomes. Those biomarkers included, for
example, the FNDC4 gene and a series of other genes—genes which we now propose to study further by
performing functional studies of the AUD biomarkers that we have already identified and to extend those studies
to include a series of protein biomarkers for both AUD drug response and AUD pathophysiology. Finally, we
will also expand our studies to include the application of iPSC-derived brain organoids from both our
AUD patients and control subjects to make it possible to identify genes and biological pathways that
contribute to acamprosate and naltrexone treatment response. In summary, the studies proposed in this
application represent a systematic attempt to identify and study molecular mechanisms underlying and
associated with variation in AUD drug treatment response phenotypes and AUD clinical outcomes in
response to drug therapy. Our use of “multiple omics” to study samples from AUD patients treated with these
drugs, followed by “functional omic” studies of those samples and concluding with the generation and study of
patient-derived brain organoids generated from the same patients make this series of studies truly unique
and—based on our preliminary data—highly promising for the identification of novel candidate genes and
pathways. The results of the proposed studies would represent a significant step toward greater understanding
of the biology of acamprosate and naltrexone treatment response in AUD, potentially leading to the development
of better and more effective AUD drug therapy, an outcome that would represent a significant advance in the
treatment of this disorder."
10978363,"SUMMARY: Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a severe and life-threatening disease that increases mortality rates
by 7-fold. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH, WHO Group 1) is the most severe subtype, with a median
survival of just three years. PAH must be distinguished from another subtype called Pulmonary Venous
Hypertension (PVH, WHO Group 2) because PAH treatments can harm PVH patients. Unfortunately, the current
diagnostic and prognostic process for PAH is slow, taking 2-4 years after symptom onset, and relies on a series
of costly, inconclusive, noninvasive tests ending with invasive catheterization for conclusive diagnosis. Delays
and invasive diagnostics worsen patient suffering and jeopardize the chances of early effective treatment. Thus, there
is an urgent need for a streamlined, accurate non-invasive tool for PAH diagnosis, classification, and prognosis.
Our project aims to develop a '4D Right-Heart Virtual Catheter (vCath)' capable of providing a comprehensive
hemodynamic analysis of all right heart chambers in less than two minutes, utilizing a single 4D Flow MRI scan.
Our 4D vCath technology combines advanced mathematical modeling and fluid dynamics with 4D Flow MRI to
create a personalized digital catheter for streamlined, simultaneous analysis of multiple advanced hemodynamic
parameters. With our innovative solution, patients can receive a full set of diagnostic and prognostic
hemodynamic assessments of all right heart chambers from a single noninvasive MRI scan. Our technology
enables the accurate diagnosis of PAH, differentiation of PAH from PVH, and precise assessment of PAH
severity prognosis, eliminating the need for multiple costly tests, expediting early diagnosis, and enabling
personalized severity monitoring. This approach has the potential to widen access to essential care for
vulnerable PH patients who cannot undergo invasive CATH or multiple tests. Our multi-center project
encompasses 3 specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an automated and rapid 4D RH vCath for a comprehensive
assessment of right heart hemodynamics and perform extensive inter-center and inter-vendor uncertainty
quantification in healthy controls. Aim 2: Conduct a multi-center cross-sectional study involving 165 subjects
from three sites (Northwestern, Mayo Clinic, and UT Southwestern), including PAH patients, PVH patients, and
healthy controls. The study aims to differentiate between PAH and PVH subtypes and assess the correlation of
4D vCath metrics with invasive Cath and MRI measures of right heart dysfunction in PH patients. Aim 3: Conduct
a multi-center longitudinal PAH outcome study, including a 1-year follow-up for PAH patients evaluating the
prognostic significance of 4D vCath for personalized evaluation and monitoring of PAH severity.
If successful, this project has the potential to revolutionize PH management by accelerating noninvasive
diagnosis, personalizing prognosis, and increasing access to timely care for a broader spectrum of patients
including those who are ineligible for invasive tests. This innovative approach holds promise for significantly
improving the outcomes and quality of life of individuals suffering from PH, particularly those with PAH."
10978719,"ABSTRACT
Pregnancy is a unique, early moment of cardiovascular stress in young women that may “unmask”
cardiovascular disease (CVD) propensity. Preeclampsia (PreE)—characterized by new-onset hypertension and
proteinuria—has been linked to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction that may persist for years post-partum, and
an increased risk of developing heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) over the decade following
pregnancy. It is unclear if PreE simply represents a failed stress test or directly contributes to the pathophysiology
of future CVD. Women and minorities are traditionally understudied in HFpEF, despite their disproportionate risk.
This is the first large prospective study to investigate the hypothesis that PreE leads to persistent functional,
hemodynamic, structural and biochemical cardiovascular changes that mirror early HFpEF. By defining the echo,
proteomic and hemodynamic risk profile for early HFpEF, this will afford the opportunity for future studies to
mitigate disease through pharmacologic/lifestyle interventions in a targeted population. We hypothesize that
persistent structural-functional myocardial alterations in women with PreE are linked to pre- and post-gravid
cardiometabolic risk factors and functional capacity and select pathways of vascular and inflammatory stress
central to HF risk. We will use perturbational hemodynamic studies to elaborate myocardial phentoypes defining
of HFpEF in women with PreE. We address our central hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims (SA): SA1: To measure
relation between post-partum subclinical LVDD and pregnancy-specific risk factors in 250 women with PreE and
250 normotensive women (25% Black) through rest and provocation echocardiographic imaging, SA2: To
quantify the hemodynamic consequences of early persistent LVDD in women with PreE, SA3: To identify
differences in cardiovascular pathways of vascular remodeling and inflammation and their association with
subclinical myocardial dysfunction in women with PreE. For this study, we will leverage the infrastructure of our
NIH funded multidisciplinary cardio-obstetrics clinical research team for recruitment, retention, and risk factor
modification (U01HG013189, R21NR020857). A fundamental strength of this proposal is the ESI PI’s experience
in recruiting and retaining women at this critical stage in CV development. Our targeted enrollment of Black
women addresses clinical and investigative gaps in this population at high short and long-term CV risk following
a preeclamptic pregnancy. Successful completion of these studies in a large group of women across race will
define high-risk PreE-linked structural/functional changes to support risk stratification and future interventional
studies at this critical moment in CVD development in women."
10985181,"Neurons are highly polarized cells that exhibit distinct moieties that serve to receive (dendrites) and transmit
(axons) electrochemical signals. In a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, loss of neuronal polarity represents
a hallmark of pathogenesis, and coincides with loss of the endomembrane organization in neurons. Despite a
growing inventory of compartment-specific factors and machinery, we lack a fundamental understanding how
neuronal polarity is established and maintained. Specifically, a vast knowledge gap exists with regard to how
bulk routing of cargo is achieved in neurons. Biosynthetic cargo, such as plasma membrane receptors and
channels involved in relaying the electrochemical signals between neurons, must be selectively delivered to
either dendritic or axonal surfaces to support neuron function. Biosynthesis of secretory cargo in neurons occurs
in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a compartment that extends throughout dendritic and axonal parts of the
neuron. At nanoscale domains of the ER, the ER exit sites (ERES), cargo is routed via membranous carriers
toward the Golgi apparatus. Golgi acceptor membranes remain near ERES, forming a 300-nm, nearly spherical
interface that exhibits a high extent of long-range order. In addition to a ribbon-like Golgi in the perinuclear region
of the cell soma, recently, additional Golgi elements termed Golgi outposts, or Golgi satellites, have been
detected at the base of dendritic arbors – prompting the view that Golgi outposts could route cargo into the
dendrite, while putatively, somatic Golgi might route cargo into the axon. In the past years, the powerful
framework of biomolecular condensation has gained attention as a mechanism putatively capable of
compartmentalizing cytosol and structuring membrane compartments, with proteins forming dynamic and flexible
networks by the means of a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Recent evidence points to the ability of multiple
proteins in the early secretory pathway to undergo LLPS – supporting the view that the early secretory pathway
may be structured by self-organizing protein collectives. We will differentiate human induced pluripotent stem
cells (hiPSCs) into mature cortical neurons that are stably transfected with fluorescently tagged ER-Golgi
interface components as molecular ‘beacons’ to enable cryo-correlative light and elecron microscopy (cryo-
CLEM) to guide cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling in conjunction with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-
ET). Our goal is to dissect the molecular architecture of the dendritic and somatic early secretory pathway at
molecular resolution in situ. This will yield an unprecedented opportunity to systematically compare the molecular
composition of individual secretory hubs, and to identify the role of condensates in the organization of these
critical cellular structures while revealing putative adaptations that might enable selective routing of cargo. Our
approach will fill critical knowledge gaps in the organization of secretory compartments in neurons, and lead to
the innovation of experimental and computational tools for the community. It will further provide a reference point
for the analysis of neuron dysfunction under various neurodegenerative conditions."
10985639,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
As the overall prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD) grows, there is an urgent need to improve diagnosis rates and identify people earlier in their disease
process. An early diagnosis could not only help implement timely measures to reduce or prevent further
progression, but also help individuals and families prepare for future financial and care needs. This work aims
to gain a better understanding of the individual- and system-level characteristics that influence diagnosis,
alongside local culture and practice, and how diagnosis can moderate the effects of cognitive decline and its
impact on employment, future care, and quality of life. Our first aim examines whether older adults
experiencing cognitive decline during their working life are more likely to experience an earlier, unplanned exit
from the workforce than individuals who do not experience cognitive decline. Making use of harmonized,
longitudinal survey data across countries, we examine the cognitive and employment trajectories of older
adults (born in 1931-1960) from the US, England, and 28 European countries, first observing these individuals
during employment age and following them throughout working life and after labor force exit. Our second aim
uses linked survey and claims data to assess the concordance between harmonized, survey-based cognitive
tests and claims-based diagnosis of MCI and ADRD in the US and six other high-income countries with
different approaches to detection. Our analysis of how concordance/discordance in dementia prevalence
varies across countries and over time, and for which populations, can help identify scope for cross-country
learning. Our third aim is to develop communication-efficient, federated learning algorithms for counterfactual
analyses to quantify the relationship between individual characteristics and time to diagnosis and
institutionalization across populations in US and peer countries, all the while ensuring strict adherence to each
country’s data protection principles. Ultimately, our project aims to leverage longitudinal, harmonized, patient-
level data across high-income countries to compare health outcomes for older adults, to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the effects of cognitive decline on employment for older adults, and to inform policies related
to the detection and care of MCI and ADRD."
10988074,"ABSTRACT. Psychological pain, which refers to feelings of shame, guilt, humiliation, fear, angst, and dread,
has emerged as an important clinical construct. The experience of psychological pain is complex; its
multifactorial influences and consequences are poorly recognized, inadequately managed, and under-
estimated in the general population. Additional challenges are noted in investigating pain experience in adult
Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color (BIPOC), who are more likely to be stigmatized, discriminated
against, and often lack support and resources that enable them to treat their pain (i.e., psychiatric or mental
health services) compared to their white counterparts. In understanding pain experience among marginalized
groups, it is crucial to acknowledge that systemic inequities extend into various aspects of life, including
healthcare. BIPOC people often experience sub-par healthcare due to discrimination based on race, gender
and/or other sociodemographic factors. Because Emergency Care (EC) settings can be critical entry points
for individuals who use substances, BIPOC people are confronted with the additional intersectional stigma
that arises due to their dual characteristics as ethnic minorities as well as people who use substances. By
addressing this intersectional experience, we aim to improve not only the immediate health and well-
being of these marginalized patients, but also to inform broader policy and clinical guidelines
surrounding substance use disorder diagnosis and treatment. In Aim 1, we first propose the use of EMA
data from the parent project to measure daily experience of pain in order to test whether psychological pain is
a mediator between discrimination and polysubstance use (N=270). Second, we propose the use of focus
group data from the parent project to qualitatively examine the social and cultural relevance of the experience
of psychological pain in the context of discrimination and polysubstance use among BIPOC adults (N~70). In
Aim 3, we propose collection of an independent set of data through surveying 100 BIPOC adults being treated
within the Emergency Department at Los Angeles General Medical Center (LAGMC) (N=100) to document and
explore the relationships between psychological pain, healthcare discrimination, and substance use among
BIPOC patients. While the parent study focuses on nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis—the three most commonly
used substances in the US, Aim 3 broadens the study scope to include opioids, methamphetamines,
cocaine, and benzodiazepines, as these are among the top substances linked to U.S. Emergency
Department visits in 2022 and are also among the most stigmatized. Together with the parent study, this will
be the first study to provide an in-depth description of the impact of discrimination on substance use behaviors
in the context of daily and prolonged psychological pain among BIPOC adults. By conceptualizing pain as the
mediator, future studies may develop momentary intervention tools which target alleviating subjective
experiences of pain associated with societal stressors."

Pioneering research in cancer biology over the past four decades has uncovered a repertoire of oncogenes and
tumor suppressors that initiate and maintain tumorigenesis across diverse cancer types. Such genetic alterations
constitute an important aspect of intra-tumor heterogeneity which is associated with a poor prognosis and
resistance to therapy. The recent application of single-cell RNA-sequencing to tumor biology has shed further
light on the composition and dynamics of intra-tumor heterogeneity. The Yanai & Wong labs and many others
have provided evidence that such heterogeneity is not exclusively explained by genetic causes, but rather also
through the process of cellular plasticity. Emerging evidence also points to a crucial role for cellular plasticity in
the process of drug resistance. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), tumors treated with a KRASG12C inhibitor
have been shown to adapt by undergoing an adeno-to-squamous transition (AST). While this line of evidence
supports a major role for cellular plasticity in tumor adaptation to treatments, we lack an understanding of the
determinants, dynamics and strategies for preventing cell state transitions. In this proposal we seek to determine
the molecular programs that maintain the chromatin landscape using cutting-edge multi-omic approaches
coupled with clinically-relevant NSCLC murine models and their derivative organoids. In Aim 1 we propose a
systematic study of the adeno-to-squamous plasticity seeking to identify and delineate its chromatin-mediated
mechanisms. Our approach seeks to identify and test means for restricting the ability of cancer cells to undergo
AST. We first determine the dynamics of chromatin landscape changes during AST in murine-derived LUAD
organoids. Then we will map functional vulnerabilities along AST using a Perturb-Seq approach, and finally, we
will test for the potency of restricting AST with small molecule inhibitors against chromatin modifiers. In Aim 2,
we propose to predict the dynamics of cellular adaptation to context-specific targeted therapies used to treat
NSCLC. We will further seek to apply these predictions to primary tumor samples and correlate with clinical
outcomes with the goal of predicting the adaptive process. Overall, the impact of this work will be to provide
insights into cellular plasticity in lung cancer in clinically-relevant settings, and the identification of strategies for
synergistic treatment combinations to inhibit cell-state transitions and to eliminate the emergence of aggressive
subpopulations."

Approximately 12% of couples are infertile and 1% of the female population worldwide experiences primary
ovarian insufficiency (POI) which results from a reduction of the ovarian follicle reserve that often leads to
premature menopause and infertility. Important pathological outcomes associated with early menopause
include osteoporosis, cardiovascular and early cognitive decline. Although several genes have been linked to
women with POI, about 90% of the cases are idiopathic. By uncovering the developmental and molecular
mechanisms underlying the establishment of the initial pool of primordial follicles and the maintenance of the
adult ovarian reserve in the mouse, we will be poised to better understand, diagnose and treat POI in the
future. We have discovered and characterized the roles of a protein called TAF4b that is essential for
establishing the healthy ovarian follicle reserve in the mouse ovary. TAF4b is a gonadal-enriched subunit of the
general transcription factor TFIID, a large multiprotein complex composed of the TATA-box binding protein
(TBP) and 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Our approach to studying the regulation of ovarian follicle
development by TAF4b has elucidated the ovarian functions of TAF4b in the context of a TAF4b-deficient
mouse model. Collectively, these studies have revealed that TAF4b-deficient female mice suffer from
hallmarks of POI including persistent estrous, elevated serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and
accelerated ovarian reserve depletion. In addition to our own work, a number of additional studies have linked
the potential function of human TAF4b in the regulation of fertility in women. Strikingly, the genetic networks
regulated by TAF4b in the mouse ovary appear to be conserved during human fetal oocyte development.
Together, these data implicate the potential deregulation of TAF4b-regulated processes in the context of
human POI and female infertility. Based upon our previous studies, we hypothesize that related TAF4b-
regulated transcriptional events and chromatin modifications in the developing mammalian oocyte serve to
properly establish the initial ovarian reserve and fertility in women. By uncovering the late embryonic oocyte-
specific molecular and developmental functions of TAF4b in transcription, chromatin modification and fetal
oocyte attrition, we aim to identify novel genes, pathways and expression mechanisms in place to ensure the
successful production of high-quality oocytes in women and perhaps one day better diagnose and/or manage
patients with POI and other related deficits of human ovarian health."

Pain is one of the most common reasons for children to visit an emergency department (ED) and is associated with short-
and long-term consequences when inadequately treated. Intravenous (IV) morphine is the prototypical and most
commonly administered parenteral analgesia for treating moderate to severe acute pain in children. However, IV
morphine is associated with acute adverse events such as respiratory depression and hypotension. In addition, there is
hesitation amongst caregivers and clinicians to administer opioids to children, leading to withholding or under-dosing
analgesics in children with pain and thereby perpetuating the undertreatment of pain and the resulting short- and long-term
sequelae. Ketamine is an NMDA-antagonist that has the potential to improve both short- and long-term sequelae of acute
pain experienced by children presenting to the ED. IV ketamine has been shown to be an effective and safe analgesic
when given using sub-dissociative doses to adults with acute pain in the ED or pre-hospital setting. Sub-dissociative
ketamine's analgesic efficacy and favorable safety profiles make it an attractive alternative to morphine. In addition,
ketamine may improve pain-related function and decrease potential long-term sequelae of acute painful events such as
chronic pain and medication dependency, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. The aims of this study
are to demonstrate that IV sub-dissociative ketamine is as effective as IV morphine for treating acute pain in children and
that its rate of cardiorespiratory events is substantially less compared to morphine. Additionally, we aim to determine if
children who receive ketamine will have better levels of pain-related function during the first week after ED presentation,
and have greater odds of experiencing more favorable post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression outcomes up to 6
months following their ED visit. We will achieve these aims by conducting an 8-site phase 3 randomized clinical trial
within the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) comparing IV sub-dissociative ketamine to
IV morphine in children presenting to the ED with acute pain. We will enroll 1010 children 6 to 17 years of age with
moderate to severe acute pain and require IV morphine for analgesia. In addition, we will study children who most
commonly receive parenteral opioids in the ED, namely those with abdominal pain or extremity fractures. We will collect
measures of pain intensity and analgesic efficacy and assess for acute adverse events during the child's ED course and
conduct follow-up procedures assessing pain-related function, analgesic use/misuse, mental health and behavioral
outcomes up to 6 months after the index ED visit. The findings of this study have the potential to fundamentally change
how acute pain is managed in children and improve both their short- and long-term health. Achieving our aims would
provide the necessary evidence to inform guidelines and support a transition from morphine to a non-opioid analgesic
such as sub-dissociative ketamine as the primary treatment modality for children with moderate to severe acute pain."
10990860,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Salivary gland (SG) morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration requires programs of self-renewal,
proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor epithelial cells. Identification of the transcriptional and signaling
networks that govern these cellular processes is critical to better understand how they impact normal SG
development and disease. However, the gene-regulatory mechanisms that control cell fate and lineage choices
in the SG are not well understood, particularly in the broader context of the chromatin environment. To address
this knowledge gap, we have focused our studies on the master Transcriptional Factor (TF) p63, especially the
epithelial enriched DNp63 isoform which plays an indispensable role in the SG. We have shown that during SG
development, DNp63+ cells are enriched in the epithelial cells of the developing placode and initial bud. Utilizing
genetic lineage tracing, we have demonstrated that p63+ multipotent precursor cells give rise to all epithelial cell
lineages of the SG during development and adult gland maintenance. Additionally, we have shown DNp63
maintains the adult SG basal and myoepithelial (MEC) stem/progenitor cell populations through modulating TGF-
b/Activin signaling. Moreover, DNp63 directs MEC cellular plasticity during homeostasis and in response to injury
and regeneration. Our comprehensive analysis and preliminary results from genetic and genomic datasets have
led us to a broad hypothesis that p63 serves as a linchpin regulator in both normal and injured states of
the SG and asserts its molecular effects by direct regulation of target genes, including key transcription
and chromatin modifying factors, and by an integrated modulation of the higher-order chromatin and
the epigenetic landscape. This hypothesis will be tested in two aims using well-characterized p63 mouse
knockouts for SG development and regeneration and ex-vivo explants. Our studies will be powered by cutting-
edge techniques of single cell genomics and epigenomics and chromatin based protein interaction. In Aim 1, we
will evaluate the role of p63 during the early stages of salivary gland development and branching morphogenesis
with a focus on Midkine (Mdk), a member of the pleiotrophin (PTN)/MK family of secreted heparin-binding growth
factors. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of p63 in submandibular gland (SMG) tissue repair and regeneration
using well established regeneration and injury induced mouse model systems and define the transcriptomic,
chromatin landscape of these cells at single cell resolution. Finally, we will perform proteomic and integrative
analyses to identify and examine the hierarchy of p63 and its targets and co-regulators in the regulatory network
in SG. This work is innovative and significant because our proposed use of sophisticated technologies to examine
transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation will lead to new discoveries into SG organogenesis
and regeneration. Long term, such knowledge will enrich existing molecular paradigms of cell-specific regulatory
networks and signaling pathways and guide therapeutic interventions in human patients with SG dysfunction."

 Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem that has damaging effects at the
individual and societal levels. Major health disparities exist for rates of IPV across age, gender, and race or
ethnicity. Women experience IPV at almost twice the rate of men, and Black women are disproportionately
killed by intimate partners compared to most other racial groups. Homicide is the second leading cause of
death for Black female youth between the ages of 15 and 24, with more than half of the deaths perpetrated by
an intimate partner. The most common method used to kill intimate partners is firearms, and firearm access as
well as threat with a firearm have been identified as key precursors to firearm-related IPV fatalities. Little to no
research has examined patterns of firearm-related IPV or factors associated with firearm-related IPV
involvement. The goal of the proposed project is to address the limitations of previous research by
investigating patterns of nonfatal firearm-related IPV involvement among individuals at different stages of
development and use a social-ecological framework to examine community, interpersonal, individual, and
situational modifiable risk and protective factors that characterize patterns of firearm-related IPV victimization
and perpetration. This goal aligns with NICHD’s research priority to effectively inform prevention strategies to
address the leading causes of traumatic injury and death among children and adolescents. These goals will be
addressed through secondary data analysis from two Federally funded projects, which provide data from local
samples of 496 middle and 1,177 high school youth and a nationally representative sample of 1,674 adults.
The specific aims are to 1) identify distinct patterns of firearm-related IPV victimization and perpetration within
the broader context of IPV, and 2) examine the demographic characteristics and modifiable risk and protective
factors that characterize IPV subgroup membership. I will test whether subgroup membership differs by age
group, gender, and race/ethnicity in each sample. The identification of patterns of individuals who display
patterns of firearm-related IPV and understanding how subgroups differ across stages of development will help
to identify sensitive time periods when prevention strategies may have the greatest impact. This approach will
also inform how firearm-related behaviors fit within the broader context of IPV as well as identify subgroups of
individuals at the greatest risk of firearm-related IPV involvement. Lastly, the identification of modifiable risk
and protective factors will inform prevention strategies by identifying targets for preventing firearm-related IPV.
Moreover, the research and training outlined in this proposed application will equip me with the skills and
support needed to pursue a successful career as a research scientist, including knowledge of relevant
theoretical models and their application to prevention and policy efforts, competencies in advanced statistical
methods, and dissemination and grant-writing skills."

 This NCI Early-stage Surgeon Scientist Program proposal for Dr. Filipe de Carvalho describes a
research plan and career development program leading up to an academic career as an independent Urologic
Oncologist surgeon-scientist investigator. Dr. De Carvalho is a urologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
committed to an independent research career focused on accelerating the development of therapeutic
strategies to target the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment in bladder cancer. This Early-stage
Surgeon Scientist Program will allow Dr. De Carvalho to become proficient in tumor-associated macrophage
biology in bladder cancer with the ultimate goal of developing novel macrophage-directed therapeutic
strategies for bladder cancer patients. Dr. De Carvalho will be mentored by Dr. Eliezer Van Allen and co-
mentors Drs. Kent Mouw and Elizabeth Mittendorf, leaders in bladder cancer genomics and cancer
immunology. Dr. Van Allen is Chief of Division of Population Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and has
mentored over a dozen of young investigators that moved to successful independent academic positions. Dr.
De Carvalho also gathered an outstanding scientific advisory committee and collaborators that excel in mouse
models, statistics and cancer genomics to guide career development and scientific progress.
 The research proposal focuses on tumor-associated macrophages, which are immune cells with a
critical role in tumor growth and immune evasion. Recent evidence revealed a therapy-induced conversion of
normally anti-tumor TAMs to a tumor-permissive phenotype. The central hypothesis is that cisplatin
induces chronic immunosuppressive IFN signaling in cancer cells leading to a TAM-infiltrated phenotype and
immune evasion in treatment-resistant tumors. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: 1) Determine the mechanism and effectiveness of targeting TAMs to improve sensitivity of bladder
cancer to combined cisplatin and immune checkpoint inhibition. 2) Dissect the tumor-TAM crosstalk that
mediates cisplatin resistance. These studies are expected to dissect how TAMs inhibit cytotoxic T-cells in
cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer in territories of immune evasion across bladder tumors as well as position
Dr. De Carvalho to submit a competitive R01 near the completion of this Program."
10994449,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the primary driver of morbidity and
mortality in lung transplant recipients. Currently there is a need to identify clinical and molecular biomarkers of
CLAD, where the latter has the potential to inform targetable pathways for intervention. There is growing
evidence to hypothesize that a key component of CLAD pathobiology is the recruitment of profibrotic
monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAM) upon injury to the lung epithelium. Profibrotic MoAMs
stimulate the activation, differentiation, and proliferation of myofibroblasts. With sustained injury, MoAMs are
continually maintained through colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) signaling through its cognate receptor
(CSF1R), leading to progressive fibrosis. T-regulatory cells dampen ongoing injury and have been shown to
mitigate CLAD in preclinical models and are also associated with more favorable lung transplant outcomes in
humans. Our group demonstrated that recipient-derived MoAMs express profibrotic genes in mice and humans
and that administering a CSF1R antagonist improved fibrosis in a murine model of CLAD. Translating these
findings in humans requires analyzing longitudinal data collected before CLAD diagnosis. Where most studies
focus on measurements made at one or two points in time, often when CLAD has significantly progressed, the
proposed work will leverage a machine learning approach developed by our group to determine clinical states
and their sequences that develop after lung transplantation. This work will examine associations between
these clinical states with flow cytometry, single cell and spatial transcriptomic analysis of BAL fluid across time
to identify early, predictive indicators of CLAD. Specifically, the proposed work will address the hypothesis that
the emergence of pathogenic MoAM and loss of tissue-resident donor-derived T-regs in serially sampled BAL
predict CLAD and ACR respectively. Aim 1 will determine whether the CSF1-driven maintenance of profibrotic
MoAMs precedes the clinical diagnosis of CLAD. Aim 2 will determine whether the paucity of tissue-resident
donor-derived T-regs is associated with CLAD after ACR. Both aims consist of 1. Combining flow cytometry
and single-cell transcriptomics to quantify cell abundances and ligand receptor analyses relevant to either aim
unique to CLAD BAL and 2. Integrating these molecular features with clinical data in machine learning models
for CLAD (aim 1) and ACR (aim 2) prediction. In leveraging these data-driven and machine learning
approaches, the long term goal of the proposed work is to reveal therapeutic targets and elucidate early signs
of ACR and CLAD for timelier intervention and to ultimately reduce lung transplant failure. The candidate and
her mentors have designed a detailed training plan that utilizes the support of diverse mentors and resources
in immunology, single-cell genomics, machine learning, and translational research. Ultimately, this training plan
enables the candidate to develop the rigorous computational and scientific skills to become an independent
physician scientist in the realm of biomedical machine learning and translational immunology."
10994551,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
With an increasingly aging and diversifying US population, the prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD) is expected to rise. The expected increase highlights the importance to address modifiable
risk factors to decrease the burden of ADRD and lead to better health outcomes. Obesity is a modifiable risk
factor that continues to pose a public health concern. Mid-life obesity is considered a risk factor for ADRD,
however late-life obesity appears to have either a null or protective association with ADRD. Potential
explanations for these mixed findings are selective survival bias, competing risk of mortality, inverse causality,
and BMI’s estimation of adiposity. These conflicting results affirm the need for a lifecourse approach to fully
delineate the contribution of obesity at different ages as a risk or protective factor on ADRD and cognitive
decline. This project will further evaluate the association between lifecourse obesity and ADRD and cognitive
change, while addressing selective survival and competing risk biases that frequently impact findings from
observational cohort studies on aging.
Data will be leveraged from three ongoing well-characterized diverse cohort studies of long-term Kaiser
Permanente members: the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences Study (KHANDLE) (n=1712),
the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR) (n=764), and the LifeAfter90 Study (LA90) (n=999).
These harmonized cohorts provide up to 60 years of data with repeated BMI and cognitive measures. BMI will
be measured using height and weight collected from health records. Adolescent BMI will be any BMI readings
between the years 10-20. Mid-life BMI will be from the ages 40-60 years, and late-life BMI will be from ages 65
years and above. Participants will be grouped into four categories based on their BMI: obese, overweight,
normal, and underweight. Cognition will be measured using the Spanish English Neuropsychological
Assessment Scale annually for KHANDLE and STAR and twice a year for LA90 participants. To address
methodological concerns of selective survival and selection bias, Aims 1,2, and 3, will use inverse probability
weighting. Aim 1 will examine different lifecourse pathways to evaluate the risk of adolescent, mid- and late-life
obesity on cognitive decline. Aim 2 will address competing risk bias and evaluate the risk of mid- and late-life
obesity with ADRD. Aim 3 will determine the mediating impact of lifecourse obesity on the association between
gender and ADRD and cognitive decline to better understand the influence of lifecourse obesity on the well
characterized gender differences in ADRD and cognitive decline.
The results from this proposed study have potential public health impacts by addressing the role of a
modifiable risk factor over the lifecourse on ADRD. These results will contribute to a better understanding of
the epidemiology of ADRD and cognitive decline in diverse populations."
10994556,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cardiomyocytes are the working muscle cells of the heart, and their number is intrinsically tied to heart function
and resilience. Too few increases the stress on each cardiomyocyte, leading to pathological changes and a
vicious cycle of cell death and fibrosis. In hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), the right ventricle (RV) is the
single working ventricle for life. This puts a lot of stress on the cardiomyocytes, often leading to heart failure
early in life. Given that the RV is expected to do twice the usual work in these hearts, the usual number of
cardiomyocytes is too few in HLHS. The goal of this proposal is to investigate how the cardiomyocytes of the
fetal heart with reduced left ventricular inflow grow differently than normal, whether by proliferation,
hypertrophy, or apoptosis. This information will help us to develop therapies to increase cardiomyocyte number
in hearts of these most vulnerable infants. Although prior studies by experienced investigators have not
perfectly modeled clinical HLHS, each has added new and important information. We have newly established a
fetal sheep model of impaired left ventricular inflow, similar to the hemodynamic pathology of HLHS.
Comparing fetal sheep chronically affected by impaired left heart inflow versus those with normal
hemodynamics, we will assess changes in the physical and hormonal factors that we know regulate
cardiomyocyte growth, maturation and survival before birth. We will then look at the hearts themselves to
determine how they have grown, and how they function. We will study the cardiomyocytes to understand their
contribution to heart growth, and to test how they respond to the regulatory factors changed in the fetus.
Finally, we will test ways to intervene and increase cell number in the heart of the fetus with reduced LV inflow.
Ultimately, this work will help optimize cardiomyocyte number in babies with HLHS in order to strengthen their
hearts for life-saving surgery and make them more resilient against heart failure for life."

Adipocytes are highly specialized cells that have a number of functions including lipid storage, insulin sensitivity,
and significant endocrine capabilities. Obesity is the primary disease of fat cells and the most common metabolic
disorder in the industrial world. Obesity affects > 30% of the adult population in the United States and is a major
risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. Diminished or
excess adiposity and/or altered adipocyte function can have a substantial negative impact on metabolic health.
Substantial advances in understanding adipocyte biology have revealed that adipose tissue is a vital contributor
to systemic metabolic health. Therefore, the identification and study of proteins that contribute to adipocyte
function can enhance our understanding of a variety of metabolic disease states.
KAT8 is a lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) that has been shown to play a role in DNA damage repair, autophagy,
apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. Although KAT8 is an important component of many cellular processes and has
been linked to several types of cancers, it is clear that it has cell- and tissue-specific roles, and the function of
KAT8 in adipocytes is poorly defined. Our unpublished data indicate that adipocyte KAT8 is important for
systemic metabolic health. A large genome-wide association study identified KAT8 as part of a novel locus that
significantly contributed to body mass index and other metabolic phenotypes. In vivo studies reveal that adipose
tissue KAT8 protein levels are altered by obesity in mice. These data coupled with our results from new KAT8
mouse models indicate that there is a strong rationale for investigating the function(s) of KAT8 in adipocytes.
The long-term objective of our proposed studies is to understand how adipocyte KAT8 contributes to adipose
tissue function and systemic metabolic homeostasis. These studies are significant because they will provide
novel insights into the roles of KAT8 in regulating fat cell function, adipose tissue production of reactive oxygen
species, and the adipose tissue microenvironment within subcutaneous and visceral white adipose depots as
well as brown adipose tissue."
10980817,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Less-than-ideal kidneys recovered from deceased donors continue to be discarded at a rate of 40-50%, but
evidence shows that many discarded kidneys could have yielded good outcomes and reduced the needlessly
high mortality on the transplant waitlist. Ensuring appropriate utilization and preventing discards of usable
kidneys requires expert pathologist interpretations of preimplantation biopsies, as such expert biopsy
interpretations strongly correlate with post-transplant outcomes above and beyond clinical characteristics.
However, organ offers often occur in the middle of the night, and many transplant centers lack 24/7 availability
of an experienced kidney transplant pathologist, so expert interpretations are often unavailable in real time.
Instead, clinical decision-making relies on the unreliable and inconsistent interpretations of on-call general
pathologists. Preimplantation biopsy interpretation from non-experts carries a high risk of inappropriate discard;
in fact, biopsy findings are cited as justification for nearly 40% of discards. We hypothesize that applying
modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including a novel self-supervised deep learning framework that
we have recently developed called Histomorphological Phenotype Learning to identify histopathologic clusters,
could ensure universal access to reliable preimplantation biopsy interpretation and reduce discards. This is
feasible as digital imaging is becoming the standard amongst organ procurement organizations (OPOs), and
AI-assisted histopathological interpretation has proven superior in other clinical scenarios.
Leveraging an array of >10,000 biopsy images shared from 4 OPOs, and externally validated with images from
another 8 OPOs as well as an international cohort, we will compare self-supervised and expert-supervised “AI-
pathology assisted” (AIPA) biopsy interpretations to those of an on-call pathologist (standard of care). We will
also compare AIPA to existing kidney biopsy scoring systems. Further, we will study stakeholder attitudes and
catalog facilitators and barriers to implementation of AI-assisted preimplantation biopsy interpretation, to
encourage rapid clinical adaptation to improved biopsy interpretations. To improve the clinical utility of
preimplantation biopsies and reduce inappropriate organ discard, we propose the development AIPA with the
following aims: (1) to use self-supervised and expert-supervised learning to construct a comprehensive
unbiased atlas of histopathology in preimplantation deceased donor kidney biopsies, (2) to develop and
externally validate AIPA-derived models and compare interpretations and association with clinically relevant
post-transplant outcomes, and (3) to develop consensus for the implementation of AIPA in clinical practice.
Our findings will be immediately clinically useful to kidney transplant providers and patients across the US in
evaluating the 50,000 kidneys recovered for potential transplantation per year. More reliable pre-transplant
biopsy interpretations will reduce discards, facilitate more appropriate utilization, and improve the clinical utility
of preimplantation biopsy for the increasing numbers of less-than-ideal kidneys being recovered."
10982148,"Project Summary / Abstract
Biological systems operate within fluctuating environments, and, therefore, are inherently tasked with accurately
responding in real-time to a myriad of signals. Recent evidence suggests that a memory of inflammation can be
encoded and retained in the epigenome of cells even following resolution of the initial stimulus. The presence of
`inflammatory memory' suggests that preservation of tissue homeostasis also incorporates an evolutionary
adaptation in which future responses are educated by past experiences.
Inflammation is essential to the disruption of tissue homeostasis, and, in the pancreas, can destabilize the identity
of terminally differentiated acinar cells. Recently, we have employed lineage-traced mouse models to delineate
the chromatin dynamics that accompany the cycle of metaplasia and regeneration following pancreatitis, and
unveiled the presence of an epigenetic memory of inflammation in the pancreatic acinar cell compartment. We
have observed that despite histologic resolution of pancreatitis, acinar cells fail to return to their molecular
baseline after several months, representing an incomplete cell fate decision – one wherein there is persistent
MAPK signaling, AP-1 activation, and IL-33 in the pancreas microenvironment. In vivo, this epigenetic memory
controls lineage plasticity, with diminished metaplasia in response to a second inflammatory insult but increased
tumorigenesis with an oncogenic Kras mutation. We have demonstrated that both persistent chromatin and
transcriptional changes constituting memory can be specifically recalled in the response to oncogenic stress.
Together, our findings have defined the dynamics and recall of an epigenetic memory of inflammation that
impacts cell fate decisions.
In this proposal, we focus on building an understanding of the molecular underpinnings of memory of
inflammation. Specifically, we will leverage our lineage-traced mouse models of pancreatic inflammation to
establish an understanding of AP-1 binding to chromatin and its interaction partners (Aim 1). We will also employ
specific genetic and pharmacologic perturbations to AP-1 factors and MAPK signaling in vivo to articulate
whether epigenetic memory is reversible (i.e. inducing epigenetic `amnesia') (Aim 2). Third, we will examine the
role of IL-33 as a cell-extrinsic factor driving the memory phenotype (Aim 3).
Together our studies will define the molecular mechanisms that govern epigenetic memory of inflammation in
the pancreas. In so doing, we expect to uncover the key cell types, transcription factors, and signaling
intermediates that lead to persistent molecular alterations following transient injury. In turn, this work will shed
new light in to how memory can be targeted to abrogate the diminished threshold for tumorigenesis. By analyzing
the rational means for inducing epigenetic `amnesia', we will exploit the therapeutic opportunity that the durability
of epigenetic memory offers to address the lasting implications of an inflammatory insult."
10982239,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
 To achieve robust control of cellular decision-making, including differentiation, a quantitative, mechanistic
description of signaling pathway dynamics and regulation is required. Indeed, signaling pathways dictate dif-
ferential gene expression, which is often the first step in differentiation. Measuring the concentration, distribu-
tion, and interactions of signaling proteins in live cells lays the foundation for building predictive models of sig-
naling. Quantitative imaging of live cells is especially important in cells and tissues that have feedback loops,
because feedback is an inherently dynamic situation.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to to synergistically use systems biology modeling and cutting edge
quantitative imaging to build a predictive model of the NF-kappaB/Dorsal gradient, which patterns the dorsal-
ventral axis of the 1-3 hr old Drosophila embryo. The central hypothesis is that negative feedback decreases
the response time of the Dl gradient, through Dl/Cact interactions within the nuclei, thereby allowing the gradi-
ent to rapidly achieve proper levels. To test this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims will be performed:
 Specific Aim 1: Determine the functional role of Cact in the nucleus. It is hypothesized that nuclear-
localized Cact ensures Dl levels rapidly reach steady state, so that gene expression is properly specified along
the DV axis. To test this hypothesis, measurements will be performed to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics
of Dl, Cact, and Dl/Cact complex in the nuclei (vs cytoplasm) along the DV axis of blastoderm stage embryos.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the functional role of the cact negative feedback loop. It is hypothesized that
weakening negative feedback will prevent the Dl gradient from reaching steady state, which will lead to impre-
cise gene expression domains. To test this hypothesis, methods described in Aim 1 will be used to measure
Dl, Cact, and Dl/Cact complex in embryos that lack the negative feedback loop. Expression patterns of Dl tar-
get genes will also be measured. Specific Aim 3: Understanding a system at the mechanistic and quantitative
level naturally leads to the formulation of a mathematical model. Ultimately, the long-term goal is to use predic-
tive models to aid in process control of biological decisions. The goal in this Aim is to make the Dl gradient
model predictive. Therefore, the model will be constrained with measured data, used to make a series of spe-

 The work will lead to several positive impacts, including, a detailed, mechanistic description impacts the
understanding of NF-κB in vertebrate systems, an understanding of the diversity of dynamical behavior exhibit-
ed by negative feedback in the NF-κB pathway, and approaches generalized to other systems."
10981554,"The overarching goal of this proposal is to add to the understanding of the complex interaction between the
tumor and the host organism to facilitate new therapeutic approaches in cancer medicine. Specifically, we aim
to establish the mechanistic explanation for the observation in two IL-6 associated murine models of cancer
cachexia that KD delays tumor growth but accelerates cancer cachexia and shortens survival. We discovered
that this uncoupling may be a consequence of the biochemical interaction of two simultaneously occurring
NADPH-dependent pathways. Within the tumor, increased production of LPPs and, consequently, saturation of
the glutathione system leads to ferroptotic death of cancer cells. Systemically, redox imbalance and NADPH
depletion impairs the biosynthesis of corticosterone, the main regulator of metabolic stress, in the adrenal
glands.
The proposal seeks to build on these discoveries in three ways. First, we will determine specific
polyunsaturated fat enriched diets and ferroptosis inducing drugs, including licensed medications, that
exacerbate the anti-cancer effect. Second, after validating that glucocorticoid deficiency is a critical component
of survival reduction of the host organism, using plasma, liver, and adrenal focused assays, we will use
systematic pharmacological rescue experiments to enable a therapeutic window for KD intervention. Third, we
will track how oxidative stress induced GDF-15 elevations may conspire with IL-6 elevations to drive cachexia
associated anorexia via neuronal circuits and thereby cause the negative energy balance that accelerates
cachexia onset in KD fed mice.
The results of this research may be of interest to scientists and medical professionals. A combination of
administration of synthetic GCs may improve food intake, normalizes glucose homeostasis and utilization of
nutritional substances, delay the onset of cancer cachexia and extends survival of tumor-bearing mice fed KD,
while not counteracting the reduced tumor growth induced by the KD-induced ferroptosis. These studies will
emphasize the importance of considering the impact of cancer treatments on the host and the tumor."

We aim to advance sepsis research and clinical diagnosis by introducing a new redox trapping formulation for
preservation of blood specimens. The new formulation is anticipated: 1) to prevent artifactual oxidation and loss
of specimen integrity during storage, 2) to enable studies of redox metabolism which underlines the dysregulated
immunometabolic response in sepsis, and 3) to improve analysis of differentiating redox molecular markers
associated with demographic features (age, gender and racial ethnicity). Our combined expertise of redox
biochemistry and innovation in patented redox chemical reagents, sepsis mechanisms, trial design and clinical
expertise will be applied first to validate the new redox trapping formulation (R21 Phase) and then to scale-up
by deploying this for collection of blood specimens at sites participating in the EMbedded Precision in Acute Care
Trials (EMPACT) Network (R33 Phase). This is a newly formed network of premier critical care clinical trials sites
designed to conduct precision clinical trials and discovery research in sepsis. Successful accomplishment of our
aims will improve staging of septic patients and clinical precision research for discovery of new therapeutic
targets for treatment of sepsis. More specifically, during the R21 Phase we will investigate the compatibility of
the new redox formulation with high-end mass spectrometry and single cell technologies to evaluate its
performance for measurement of redox and other biomarkers. The new formulation will be compared with current
standard of care procedures for blood collection for clinical and research purposes (gold standard). To further
validate this formula in sepsis patients, we will then evaluate its effects on standard clinical lab tests in a pilot
study using prospectively collected paired single timepoint samples from critically ill patients with sepsis. We will
further determine the advantage of redox trapping formulation by linking the measurements to physiologic and
outcome data collected passively through the Wake Forest Critical Care Data Analytic Platform. Upon
accomplishment of key metrics at the completion of R21 Phase, we will work with the EMPACT Network in the
R33 Phase to collect blood specimens from 150 patients at 3 timepoints across the continuum of their disease
progression using the standard methods and the new redox formulation. Analysis using high-end omics
technologies will produce information-rich and redox-specific datasets, which will be integrated using
bioinformatics approaches and linked to clinical data captured passively via the EMPACT data warehouse to
generate new hypotheses for sepsis research. Lastly, we include a plan to share cryopreserved specimens,
clinical and molecular data with investigators at the institution to support discovery or hypothesis-driven research
through pilot mechanisms under the Center for Redox Biology and Medicine and Critical Illness, Injury and
Research Recovery Research Center directed by MPIs Furdui and Files, respectively, and with outside
investigators via EMPACT."
10988867,"Summary
The selective absence of IgM in humans, a rare genetic disorder, is linked to enhanced autoimmunity, as well
as increased risk of infections, consistent with studies in mice. In mice, most spontaneously generated “natural”
IgM is produced by broadly autoreactive B-1 cells, cells that develop in multiple waves during the fetal and early
neonatal period, through a developmental path that is controlled in part by epigenetically regulators of fetal
hematopoiesis (Lin28/Let7). Their distinct developmental processes select for a unique and self-reactive Ig-
repertoire that characterizes these B-1 cells, which in turn defines their transcriptional profile. Our recent studies
have identified two distinct subsets of nIgM-secreting B-1 cells in bone marrow and spleen: B-1 plasma cells (B-
1PC) and non-terminally differentiated B-1 cells (B-1sec). The distinct pathways these cells take to becoming
nIgM-producing cells, and thus the mechanisms controlling these autoreactive, yet functionally critical nIgM-
secreting B cell subsets, is largely unknown. Filling this gap in knowledge is important as it may identify novel
control mechanisms of B cell-mediated autoimmunity, guide the identification of human B-1 orthologues, and
eventually their manipulation for therapeutic or prophylactic uses. We have been involved in a large-scale
phenotypic reverse genetics screening effort of 14 weeks-old C57BL/6 mice with single, known gene deficiencies
(“knockouts”), generated by an NIH-supported consortium. We used two multicolor flow cytometric panels to
screen the spleens of 4,390 mice (3F/3M mice per genotype) and 617 distinct genotypes for changes in leukocyte
populations. Using an unbiased data analysis approach, we recently identified 18 knockout mice with significant
and selective changes in splenic B-1 cells. 17 of those have not previously been shown to affect B cell
development or differentiation. One, Rac-2 was previously shown to affect B-1 and marginal zone B cells
demonstrated the validity of our approach. Aim 1 of this application is to explore the functional impact of 7 of
these novel genes on the development of B cell subsets, especially the nIgM-secreting B-1PC and B-1sec in
spleen and bone marrow and their B cell extrinsic and intrinsic expression. In Aim 2 we propose to study the
functional impact of the genes, by measuring antibody production from birth – 14 weeks of age by ELISA and
ELISpot and assessing the repertoire via auto-antigen array. Neonatal allotype-chimera approaches will
determine to which extent validated genes regulates B-1 cells and their differentiated nIgM secreters in a B cell-
intrinsic versus extrinsic manner. Expected results would identify novel genes and/or regulatory pathways
selectively responsible for the regulation of natural Ig production. This would enable future follow-up studies to
define the molecular mechanisms by which each of the identified genes regulate these cells and might help to
develop gene-signatures that could aid the identification of B-1 orthologues in humans or other model species.
It may also reveal pathways that more broadly control antibody production by autoreactive B cells."

Our proposal aims to uncover the intricate relationships between environmental, genetic, and 'omic factors in
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) development. Given the limitations of environmental and genetic studies in fully
elucidating T2D risk, we intend to identify their combined effects in diverse populations and their role in insulin
resistance and beta-cell dysfunction. Central to our research is the exposome, representing environmental and
behavioral factors, and the genome, representing polygenic risk, and its influence on insulin resistance, beta-
cell function. Are there different genetic and exposomic pathways to insulin resistance and beta-cell
dysfunction? Circulating blood 'omic assays, such as the metabolome and proteome, will be instrumental in
deducing exposomic and genomic phenotype pathways related to insulin secretion and resistance that, in turn,
ultimately lead to T2D. Aim 1. Perform and create software for exposome-wide by genome-wide polygenic
predictors study (E by PRS) against insulin resistance, B-cell function and incident T2D. We hypothesize that it
is possible to identify differences of the effect of the exposome and the genome across the diabetes physiome,
including measures of insulin resistance (e.g, HOMA-IR), beta-cell function (HOMA-B, insulin levels), elevated
glycemic traits (e.g., HA1C%) in CDC NHANES with linked Medicare, Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Multi-
ethnic Study on Atherosclerosis (MESA), Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA),
and Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB). We will deliver software and data to identify the architecture of
the longitudinal exposome and polygenic predictors in T2D and glycemic traits.
Aim 2. Catalog circulating biomarkers associated with the exposome and the genome and relate these
biomarkers to incident diabetes across biobanks. We hypothesize that circulating `omics will capture
endogenous responses to the exposome and genome, called Exposure Biomarkers (ExBs), and Genome
Biomarkers (GeBs), respectively. Biological responses will be associated with incident T2D, and output a
database of predictions between the genome, exposome and circulating `omics (the “genome-exposome
atlas”), deriving new biomarkers of exposure. We will use genetic approaches, including Mendelian
randomization to infer causal effects between the ExB biomarkers and T2D. We expect this application to
develop a new systems genetics/physiology approach for discovering elusive exposome, and exposome by
PRS interactions, in T2D. Our open data and analytic products and pipelines will increase the value of existing
federal resources, making exposome and genome research accessible to diabetes researchers."
10978722,"Project Summary:
Accumulating genomic damage to neurons is a cardinal feature of Alzheimer’s disease and the normal aging
process. Although cognitive stimulation has been shown to attenuate the debilitating effects of Alzheimer’s
disease on brain function, stimulus-dependent neuronal activity also poses an inherent risk to genomic stability
across the long lifespan of central nervous system (CNS) neurons insofar as activity-driven transcriptional
responses proceed via the transient induction of local DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs), which must be
repeatedly repaired. DSB accumulation is an early feature of Alzheimer’s disease. Yet, the extent to which these
Alzheimer’s disease-associated breaks represent unrepaired sites of activity-induced DSBs, and whether
postmitotic neurons employ distinctive repair mechanisms to maintain genomic integrity in the face of these
challenges, remain unclear. In the course of investigating features of the neuronal activity-dependent
transcriptional program, we uncovered a biochemical coupling of neuronal activity to DNA repair mechanisms.
We find that a novel form of the NuA4 chromatin remodeling/DNA repair complex assembles around the
neuronal-specific activity-regulated transcription factor NPAS4 at activity-responsive gene regulatory elements
in the mouse brain, with NPAS4:NuA4 disruption leading to local defects in DNA repair, increased genomic
instability, and shortened lifespan. To gain further insight into the nature of these recurrent neuronal activity-
induced DNA break/repair mechanisms and their contribution to Alzheimer’s disease- and aging-associated
cognitive decline, we propose: 1) to map the landscape of activity-induced DSBs in wild-type mice and mouse
models of Alzheimer’s disease, 2) to assess the contribution of stimulus-induced neuronal DSBs to age-
associated genomic alterations, and 3) to characterize the specialized DSB repair mechanisms active in human
postmitotic neurons with the hope of finding inhibitors or activators of the repair process that might ultimately
serve as starting points for the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed
studies will thus provide new insights into the distinctive DNA repair systems active in CNS neurons, clarify the
contribution of recurrent neuronal activity-induced DNA breaks to Alzheimer’s disease- and age-associated
genomic instability, and ultimately provide new opportunities for the development of therapeutic strategies to
combat Alzheimer’s disease."

Illicit drug use is pervasive, yet treatment rates remain disproportionately low. Individuals with substance use
disorder (SUD) encounter numerous obstacles to engagement in treatment. Addressing the specific needs of
groups least likely to receive treatment requires integrating their perspectives into user-centered design.
Between 2015 and 2020, the rate of fatal opioid overdoses in Virginia increased from 10.8 to 25.1 deaths per
100,000, with significantly greater increased mortality for African Americans. There are racial disparities in
rates of prescriptions for medications for opioid use disorder and completion of office-based treatment
programs. To better understand the needs and barriers faced by adults with SUD in underserved, high-poverty
communities in Richmond, VA. In the initial phase of our project, the Virginia Patient Engagement Resource
Center (PERC) is set to establish and sustain a patient advisory panel. Comprising approximately 15 members
from Richmond and the surrounding region, this panel will include people in recovery as well as peer recovery
navigators. Employing diverse engagement strategies, we aim to create an inclusive, accessible, and
productive structure, drawing lessons from existing literature and fostering authentic engagement.
Collaborating with the panel, our focus will be on building their capacity as consultants to researchers striving
to enhance SUD treatment and research. We will implement a consultation process co-developed with the
panel to facilitate discussions with researchers regarding their grant proposals, ongoing research projects,
and/or emerging research outcomes. The impact of the panel on both its members and participating
researchers will be systematically evaluated. Moving into the second phase, the PERC will adopt a community-
based participatory (CBPR) approach to investigate patient experiences. The CBPR approach recognizes the
importance of engaging stakeholders equitably across all facets of research and is particularly important in
addressing the needs of vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations often excluded from health research.
Research on patient experiences will include a survey of individuals not yet in recovery as well as qualitative,
participatory, arts-based research that aims to empower participants to explore and articulate their
experiences. Data and insights gleaned from the research and collaboration with stakeholders will inform the
design of responsive interventions or tailoring of existing evidence-based strategies. In the third phase, we will
plan and conduct two pilot research projects focused on increasing treatment initiation and retention. Testing
strategies proposed by stakeholders, our goal is to establish a proof of concept regarding the impact of patient
panels on SUD intervention efforts. Our broader objective is to gather multiple perspectives on the feasibility
and accessibility of SUD service delivery to inform program modifications tailored to the needs of underserved
patients, ultimately improving treatment initiation and retention rates."
10983207,"This proposal is in response to a request for applications for the Continuation of ChiLDReN, the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network. Over the past twenty years, through a coordinated effort, investigations of cholestatic pediatric disorders have been advanced and we have established a robust database and biorepository for further research. Little is known about the pathogenesis, natural history, and optimal treatment strategies for the rare pediatric liver diseases investigated by ChiLDReN. We at The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) propose to continue to participate in this Consortium, and thereby advance the field through collaborative research. CHOP has been a highly productive member of ChiLDReN for the last 20 years. In this application, we propose to continue our participation in all aspects of the ChiLDReN consortium, including observational and interventional study protocols, genomics initiatives, ancillary studies and dissemination of research findings. Only through collaboration can we improve the quality and efficiency of care provided to all individuals diagnosed with one of the diseases studied by this network.
We have assembled a team of physicians and scientists who contribute substantially to the intellectual and practical needs of the Consortium. The Core Staff includes the Principal Investigators, the Co-Investigators, the Program Manager and the Research Study Coordinators. Other interested scientists and clinicians will participate as determined by Consortium protocols. Our team will continue to collaborate fully with the SDCC and the other investigators to advance scientific discoveries in rare pediatric liver diseases. We will continue to follow patients in the active observational clinical protocols, including PROBE, BASIC, LOGIC, MITOHEP, PSC and Genetic Collection Study, and enroll new participants with biliary atresia and PSC. We will continue to collaborate with the SDCC to implement procedures for uniform data collection, handling and transmittal of data, as well as data audits and other data quality control procedures. We will continue leadership and committee membership in administrative roles, study protocols and disease working groups. The team at CHOP will continue to lead and actively participate in writing groups for Network studies, to promote the dissemination of new knowledge in these rare liver diseases. We will continue to develop new ancillary and translational studies leveraging the robust data and samples previously collected in the ongoing network-wide studies. With the continuation of the Childhood Liver Disease Research Network, robust collaboration among Centers will lead to advances in the field to improve outcomes for children with rare liver disease."

 I am an Assistant Professor at the School of Nursing at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)
in Galveston, Texas. The purpose of this resubmitted K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
Development proposal is to provide me with the knowledge, analytical skills, and experience necessary to
become a successful investigator. This K23 award will graciously provide the necessary support to accomplish
my 5-year career goals: (1) to learn more complex, multivariate statistical methods, such as latent class
analysis and regressions utilizing longitudinal data; (2) to strengthen my proficiency in mixed-methods analysis;
(3) to develop content knowledge about the sociocultural context of Black male youth who are most at risk for
recurrent firearm injury; and (4) to obtain the necessary career development skills (i.e., writing, dissemination,
and networking) to become a federally funded independent investigator who informs healthcare practice with
evidence. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a mentoring and advisory team of high-caliber
researchers, led by Dr. Jeff Temple (primary mentor), Vice Dean of Research and Scholarship and Director of
the Center for Violence Prevention at UTMB, and Dr. Shannon Juengst (co-mentor), Clinical Investigator at
TIRR Memorial Hermann and an expert in patient outcomes research, rehabilitation, latent class analysis, and
instrumentation.
 The psychosocial and behavioral health outcomes of non-fatal firearm injuries are understudied. During
the K23 period, I will accomplish the following aims: (1) identify the psychosocial and behavioral health sequela
of interpersonal firearm injury, including the associated risk for repeat victimization across 1 year, and (2)
identify latent classes of participants who cluster around similar responses and thus share similar risk of repeat
victimization and firearm propensity (access, ownership, carriage, attitudes). I hypothesize that (1a)
participants with higher levels of psychological distress, lower mental cognition, and more engagement in risky
behaviors will have a heightened risk of recurrent firearm victimization. I further hypothesize that this risk is
mitigated by the protective effects of adult social support, economic mobility (e.g., aspirations for work and
school), and safe environments. Second (2a), I hypothesize that at least 3 subgroups of participants exist,
exhibiting low-, middle, and high-risk for repeat victimization and firearm propensity.
 Addressing these aims will have a tremendous impact on understanding the burden of non-fatal firearm
injuries among individuals who are transitioning into young adulthood and developing life trajectories. Findings
will also inform healthcare strategies (e.g., screening for associated psychosocial and behavioral risk factors)
and form the basis for larger research and implementation studies to build and evaluate effective hospital-
based violence intervention programs."
10985351,"Project Summary
In 2022, more than 6 million individuals suffered from Alzheimer's disease and related
dementia (ADRD) in the United States, and this figure is projected double to 12.7 million by
2050. As ADRD progresses, individuals experience cognitive decline and require significant
long-term care and help with essential daily activities. As the U.S. population ages, the demand
for elder care, especially for patients living with ADRD, is outpacing the supply. We propose
examining the different components of ADRD caregiving within a comprehensive framework by
using a novel modeling approach, macro-simulation. Using the family as a decision-making
unit, we will simulate individual- and family-level economic and well-being outcomes based on
the rich literature and datasets on ADRD caregiving and its impacts. We will then aggregate
these outcomes based on a structural macroeconomic model to assess the overall implications of
family care decisions.
Families often face difficult tradeoffs in making care arrangements and deciding how to allocate
family resources to meet the needs of their elderly members. Our proposed approach models the
decision-making process of the family when determining the combination of formal and
informal care while considering a wide array of factors such as care needs, the availability of
caregivers, and the cost of formal care. Simultaneously, the framework incorporates the supply
of formal paid care in the market, how it depends on labor market conditions and how it
responds to changes in demand for paid care. We combine data from various nationally
representative household surveys to simulate a dataset that is unique in scope to characterize
health, socioeconomic, and well-being outcomes, and family composition. Our ultimate goal is
to develop an analytic tool that informs the design, targeting, and implementation of effective
public policies that address care challenges. We use our comprehensive framework to simulate
demographic trends, including growth in aging population, and policy interventions that affect
the demand and supply of care to examine their effects."

 Quaovi Sodji, MD, PhD is a Tenure track Assistant Professor in the Department of Human Oncology at the
University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. His long-term goal is to use his
acquired clinical and research expertise in radiation oncology, drug discovery and cancer immunotherapy to
develop treatments that can improve the lives of patients with solid tumors including the pediatric cancer
neuroblastoma. He aims to develop a translational research program investigating the use of low-dose targeted
radionuclide therapy (TRT) to sensitize tumors to killing by chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells.
 The purpose of this career development award is to provide Dr. Sodji with the support and mentorship needed
to develop a successful translational research program. His proposal will be performed under the primary
mentorship of Zachary Morris, MD, PhD, an expert in immuno-radiobiology and Christian Capitini, MD, an expert
in CAR T cell therapy. Other members of his mentorship committee include Paul Sondel, MD, PhD, an expert in
immunogenetics, Jamey Weichert, PhD, an expert in radionuclide chemistry and Bryan Bednarz PhD, an expert
in nuclear medicine. The training plan includes formal coursework, seminars, national conferences, and hands-
on training activities to expand expertise in 1) tumor immunology and CAR T cell engineering, 2) radiochemistry
and dosimetry, and 3) laboratory management, mentoring, and grantsmanship.
 CAR T cells are “living drugs”, tailored to each patient that can directly recognize and kill cancer cells. They
have been very effective against blood cancers, but not against solid tumors including one of the most common
childhood cancers, neuroblastoma, which is very deadly cancer when it relapses. This limitation of CAR T cells
in solid tumors has been attributed to their inability to penetrate the tumors and the loss of their killing potential
over time. TRT, a form of radiation where a radioactive chemical is linked to a drug that can selectively deliver it
to cancer cells, has been shown to increase the infiltration of immune cells into tumors and the susceptibility of
tumor cells to immune-mediated destruction. The goal of this proposal is to use TRT to deliver radiation to all
tumors throughout the body to overcome the factors that presently limit the success of CAR T cells against solid
tumors like neuroblastoma. This proposal aims to 1) identify the amount of TRT-emitted radiation that CAR T
cells can safely withstand, 2) determine if and how this form of radiation increases the potential of CAR T cells
to kill tumor cells and 3) evaluate whether TRT in combination with CAR T cells is effective in eradicating tumors
in murine models of neuroblastoma. This proposal will lay the groundwork to justify the evaluation of this
combination therapy in clinical trials for patients with neuroblastoma. Our anticipated findings will have enormous
translational potential as a therapeutic approach that could be tested in any cancer for which a tumor-selective
TRT agent and a tumor surface antigen-specific CAR T cell could be engineered."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application is for Dr. Lolita Nidadavolu,
Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology at the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine. Dr. Nidadavolu’s long term goal is to establish an independent research career
in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) focused on disease-associated changes in innate immune signaling and cell-free
DNA (cf-DNA). To achieve this goal, the candidate has assembled an interdisciplinary team that includes experts
in AD, clinical trials, gerontology, chronic inflammation, microglia biology, and biostatistics. The proposed
research for this Career Development Award addresses the critical need to further understand chronic
inflammation in AD, which may lead to development of novel treatment options targeting inflammation. Microglia,
the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are major contributors to chronic inflammation in AD.
However, a knowledge gap remains in understanding factors that contribute to microglial activation and
dysfunction in AD. One proposed contributor to AD-associated microglial activation is cell-free DNA, which is
released following cell death processes and can be measured in serum. Prior studies demonstrate that
individuals with elevated levels of cf-DNA in serum have lower cognitive test scores and a higher risk of
developing AD. Additional preliminary evidence shows that patient-derived cf-DNA is sufficient to upregulate
inflammatory cytokines in microglia in vitro. The hypothesis of this proposal is that cf-DNA are associated with
microglia activation and can activate pro-inflammatory pathways known to be upregulated in AD. This proposal
will use serum and autopsy samples from Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC) Religious Orders Study
and Memory and Aging Project (ROS-MAP) participants as well as Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine Center of
Excellence in Alzheimer’s Disease (PMCoE-AD) and the Johns Hopkins Older American’s Independence Center
(OAIC) to examine associations between cf-DNA and disease-associated microglial activation. First,
associations will be examined between serum cf-DNA levels and microglia activation (Aim 1). Next, functional
changes in microglia phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory pathway activation will be studied in human inducible
pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia exposed to purified cf-DNA from individuals with AD and normal cognition
controls (Aim 2 and 3). The successful completion of the proposed research will lead to a better understanding
of associations between cf-DNA and microglia activation in AD. Additionally, the collaborations and training in
this Career Development Award will provide the coursework, research experience, clinical trial skills, and
mentorship to solidify the applicant’s expertise as an independent clinician scientist and leader in microglia
function and dysregulation in AD."
10988836,"Project Summary/Abstract
This project responds to PAR-24-022 for the Trailblazer Award for new and early-stage investigators. It will test
the hypothesis that injury-induced cell-specific dysregulation in mitochondria bioenergetic and metabolic
functions transforms them into neurodegenerative factories that control the onset of acute neuroinflammation,
neuronal damage, and the AD-like pathology spread in the long term. Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) launches a
complex cascade of poorly understood neurochemical and neurometabolic abnormalities that lead to long-lasting
disabilities and morbidity 1-4. These secondary injury effects are potentially preventable and manifest in energy
failure, metabolic dysregulation, chronic glial neuroinflammation, and death of the surrounding tissue 5-7, and
recently, researchers implicated TBI as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders, such as
Alzheimer’s (AD) 5-8, Parkinson’s disorders (PD) 9,10, or Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) 9 later in life.
The devastating long-term consequences of brain injuries urge the scientific community to understand complex
intercellular, organellar, and molecular interactions and their contribution to injury progression if we want to
succeed in the effective development of diagnostic biomarkers and treatments for TBI patients. Based on the
extensive analysis of existing human data and some preliminary experiments from our group, where we observed
alterations in the metabolism based on the transcriptomic analysis, secreted metabolites, and miRNA 22-24,35, we
postulated that disruption in mitochondrial function is one potential regulator of injury-induced AD-like phenotype
progression 8, 9,10. Thus, this project aims to study the cell-specific mitochondria dysfunction hypothesis using a
novel approach to studying brain injury and injury-induced AD-like neurodegeneration progression by going from
human-based data collection to hypothesis testing in a human in vitro model with genetically inserted fluorescent
tags to mitochondria. We will combine neurobiology with neurometabolism to determine in Aim 1) injury-induced
intracellular and extracellular mitochondria alterations and validate in Aim 2) the molecular mechanism
associated with injury-induced cell-specific mitochondria reuptake. We anticipate building a comprehensive
understanding of spatial-temporal changes in mitochondria bioenergetic and metabolic functions after injury and
the molecular mechanisms involved in injury-induced AD-like neurodegeneration progression associated with
intercellular transfer of dysfunctional mitochondria. This proposal encompasses a novel combination of molecular
engineering, genetic, and molecular approaches to provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the
response to brain-like tissue injury over a prolonged period with high spatiotemporal resolution. This would help
develop criteria for risk assessment and allow for more accurate sensing of neuropathologic damage in TBI
patients."

Cardiac diseases remain the leading cause of human morbidity and mortality. Cardiac microtissues/organoids
built from human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) provide promising
platforms for disease modeling and long-term treatment (e.g., through transplantation). However, recapitulating
the intricate environment of the human heart, especially the global cell maturity, has proven challenging in vitro.
One primary hurdle is the lack of consistent delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the deep-layer tissue, leading to
unbalanced tissue development that eventually impairs the full functional maturation for precision studies.
Existing artificial vascular systems are either confined to planar substrate or limited in resolution, falling short of
the spatial coverage and resolution in the capillary network of a living organ for efficient media delivery. Moreover,
no concurrent sensing network and bioelectronic data analytics are available to provide real-time and
comprehensive assessment (e.g., link to molecular cell mechanisms) of the delivery effect across the 3D tissue.
To fill in the gaps, we aim to develop an ultra-flexible and stretchable bioelectronic microarchitecture that
integrates a capillary-like network for efficient media delivery and a tissue-like sensing network for tissue-state
feedback. The system will be seamlessly integrated with cardiac microtissues to improve tissue development.
We will also translate the real-time physiological feedback to molecular cell mechanisms to enable
comprehensive quantification of the delivery effect.
To realize the goals, Aim 1 will focus on constructing the flexible bioelectronic microarchitecture, optimizing the
converged delivery and sensing functions, integrating the system in cardiac microtissues, and evaluating the
interfacing intimacy and media delivery efficiency. Aim 2 will focus on the comprehensive analysis and
optimization of delivery effect, through the multiple efforts of performing long-term electrical recording, employing
in situ electro-sequencing to combine 3D spatial transcriptomics with electrical recording, and using analytics to
connect functional phenotypes to molecular cell mechanisms. The success of this work will provide a
transformative platform for improving cardiac tissue engineering. This platform can be readily translated to other
tissue systems for improving function and development."

While early findings suggested that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) depend mainly on glycolysis, emerging
evidence from our lab and others has shown that mitochondrial metabolism, and particularly fatty acid oxidation,
is essential to HSC fate determination. We hypothesize that mitochondrial metabolism is remodeled at the
initiation of the fate choice process to meet the changing needs of proper HSC function. However, our
understanding of the relationship between HSC self-renewal and lipid metabolism remains limited. A leading
goal of our research is identification of the key metabolic pathways directing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate
decisions. The goals of our ongoing study are three-fold: (1) In Aim 1, we will induce the selective consumption
of metabolites localized in the mitochondria to identify metabolic targets of fatty acid metabolism that affect HSC
fate; (2) in Aim 2, we will use pharmacological or genetic modulation of key genes impacting fatty acid oxidation
or its downstream targets to define the metabolic crosstalk between mitochondria and the cytosol; and (3) in Aim
3 we will evaluate the coordinated process that yields HSC division symmetry in vivo, and analysis of division
balance will provide insights into the in vivo relevance of fatty acid metabolisms to HSC fate choice. If successful,
our research will positively impact the field by providing a deeper understanding of the metabolic cues
coordinating HSC fate decisions, and will suggest potential methods of shifting the division balance of HSCs
toward self-renewal through metabolic manipulation to improve clinical outcomes after transplantation.
In this diversity supplement, we propose to include Mr. Carlos Hurtado Muñoz as a primary member in our R01
project, which focuses on studying the roles of lipid metabolism in the maintenance of HSCs. Carlos is a young
scientist with an impressive research background despite his age, highlighting his dedication to translational
research. Throughout his undergraduate career, he devoted every summer to full-time research at various
academic institutions, equipping him with the essential understanding and technical skills required to excel in
our project. We will develop Mr. Hurtado Muñoz’ participation in this project as part of a structured training
experience. We describe in this proposal how his project activities will involve activities that are designed to
foster transferrable skills. These skills will not only be related to the field of hematology/stem cell biology but also
project management, communication, leadership, and supervisory skills, and training in ethics and integrity. Mr.
Hurtado Muñoz has defined his career goal explicitly as a future independent physician-scientist. Our goal during

10991927,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The human ability to retrieve information from past experiences is essential for everyday living, shows robust
improvement across childhood, and is impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders.
Yet we know little about the neurophysiological mechanisms subserving this core cognitive ability in the
developing brain. Memory retrieval relies on precisely timed dynamic interactions between key brain regions,
but noninvasive techniques, commonly used to probe the neural basis of human memory development, are
unable to measure both the spatial and temporal properties of memory at high resolution. Intracranial EEG
(iEEG) in patients with surgically implanted electrodes for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy provides the
resolution needed to characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of memory and is thus a powerful tool for
examining the neural basis of human memory. During the prior funding period, the investigators established
pediatric iEEG as an invaluable tool for elucidating the neurophysiological basis of memory formation in the
developing brain. In this project, they will investigate memory retrieval and test the contributions of two
complementary processes to successful retrieval: the enactment of strategic control mediated by the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and the representation of mnemonic content in the MTL and visual cortices. Guided by strong
preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that the robust improvement in memory ability between childhood
and adulthood is largely supported by the enactment of strategic control mediated by the PFC. In contrast, the
contribution of the reinstatement of mnemonic content in the MTL and visual cortices to successful retrieval is
largely stable across development and is a core component contributing to children’s memory. These
hypotheses will be tested with iEEG data collected from 50 pediatric epilepsy patients and fMRI data collected
longitudinally from 100 typically developing children, adolescents, and young adults by pursuing these specific
aims: Aim 1) Identify strategic control-dependent retrieval mechanisms mediated by PFC and Aim 2) Identify
content representation-dependent retrieval mechanisms in MTL and visual cortices. To establish the
translational relevance of the mechanisms identified with iEEG and fMRI, the investigators will link measure of
retrieval obtained with iEEG or fMRI to individual differences in standardized memory scores (Aim 3). This will
pave the way to utilizing these measures in the design of interventions to alleviate memory deficits in children.
Moreover, findings from this project will provide crucial insights for the feasibility of mapping of memory
networks in children with focal epilepsy which can influence diagnostic and therapeutic surgical approaches,
and ultimately improve quality of life in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. At the completion of this
project, the investigators will have identified how mechanisms in the developing brain that coordinate memory
and bear broad translational relevance for the treatment of memory deficits prominent in many psychiatric and
neurological disorders."

10993234,"Project Summary
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease with a greater prevalence and severity in adult women than
men. Mounting evidence suggests that sex differences in asthma are related to female steroid sex hormones,
including estrogens. Estrogens have significant effects on lung function and responses to allergic challenge in
male and female lung, acting via receptors including the estrogen receptors α and β (ERα and ERβ) and the G
protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER). Prior studies from Dr. Silveyra’s laboratory (PI) have reported
influences of circulating sex hormone levels in the lung inflammatory response to allergen challenge, using
transgenic mouse models coupled with house dust mite (HDM) exposure. In this study, we will expand the
studies conducted in the parent grant to characterize intracellular signaling cascades mediated by the GPER in
the asthmatic bronchial epithelium. We hypothesize that the GPER mediates sex-specific responses activated
during HDM allergen challenge. To test this hypothesis, we will assess the effect of HDM challenge in GPER
signaling using human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) from asthmatic females and males (Aim 1). We will
also evaluate sex differences in GPER signaling pathways and second messengers activated by HDM and
estrogen in HBEC from asthmatic patients (Aim 2). The training plan of the proposed PDS diversity supplement
is integrated with the experimental approach and will enable the candidate to gain scientific knowledge and
communication skills, become proficient in molecular endocrinology and cell signaling bench skills, and obtain
preliminary data to apply for independent research funding as a postdoctoral fellow. Training and mentoring will
involve meetings with the primary mentor, Dr. Silveyra, her investigative team at Indiana University
Bloomington, two additional faculty advisors (Dr. Hocevar and Dr. Owora), coursework, and seminars.
Coursework will be supplemented with training in laboratory techniques to establish an understanding of the
pathophysiology of lung diseases and research design to assess sex-specific mechanisms and incorporating
sex as a biological variable. This combination of mentoring, bench training, and coursework will equip the
candidate to build his research career and work towards providing a better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms and pathways underlying lung diseases that differentially affect males and females."

This application requests funding to support the 2025 International Workshop on Pulmonary Imaging, a three-
day meeting to be held from February 20-22, 2025, and the eighth iteration of this workshop to take place at the
University of Pennsylvania. The majority of requested funds will be used to cover the cost of travel and lodging
for junior researchers—undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows and junior
faculty—presenting at the workshop. A smaller portions of these funds will be allocated to help pay for publication
costs related to workshop materials as well as live webcasting so that interested individuals around the world
who are unable to attend in-person still have the opportunity to view and participate in the proceedings.
As pulmonary disease represents the third leading cause of mortality worldwide (rising to almost 4 million deaths
annually), there is an increasing need for novel imaging techniques to provide earlier/more accurate diagnoses
and improved treatment monitoring. The field of pulmonary imaging is more expansive today than ever—
spanning an unprecedented range of techniques for structural, functional and molecular lung assessments being
developed across the disciplines of physics, biology, engineering, chemistry, computer science, medicine and
more. Given its rapidly-evolving nature, the existence of a regular forum in which scientists and clinicians in the
field can meet with and communicate their ideas to one another is of the utmost importance. In the absence of
other scientific meetings with a similarly focused agenda, our previous workshops have succeeded in providing
just such a forum—creating a valuable opportunity for rigorous, collaborative exchange.
The specific aims of the proposed workshop are as follows: (1) host a one-day workshop on pulmonary fibrosis;
(2) keep the pulmonary imaging community informed regarding the most recent developments in structural,
functional and molecular lung imaging; (3) investigate the use pulmonary imaging to non-invasively assess
treatment efficacy for interstitial lung diseases (ILDs); (4) explore novel approaches for integrating deep learning
with pulmonary imaging to improve diagnosis and phenotyping and predict disease progression; (5) broadcast
the full workshop program live online, allowing interested parties free, real-time access to the proceedings.
Finally, we intend to hold a one-day boot camp the day before the conference focused on pulmonary fibrosis.
This boot camp will consist of ~5 one-hour presentations on topics related to this central theme, with significant
question and answer time, and a final discussion panel during which the goal will be to synthesize the most
important issues covered over the course of the event. Finally, the 2025 workshop will expand its focus to include
new dedicated sessions on topics such as pulmonary vascularization, small airways disease, ILDs—and
specifically idioopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)—while also the maintaining recent emphasis on assessing
treatment response through imaging, the integration of deep / machine learning techniques, and bridging the
gap between current clinical practice and innovative imaging technologies."

Abstract
Molecular imaging (MI) technologies are being used in multiple disciplines to transform our understanding of
biology and pathogenesis, to drive detection to earlier and earlier stages of disease and refine therapies for
nearly all human diseases. The field of MI represents a fusion of diverse scientific fields, including instrumentation
physics, molecular biology, medicine, engineering and chemistry, and has a major impact on all areas of
biomedicine. The World Molecular Imaging Society (WMIS) embodies the field of MI as an organization
dedicated to developing and promoting preclinical and clinical imaging using all modalities that have the
capability of providing cellular and molecular information in living subjects. The tools and technologies supported
by the WMIS, and featured at its annual meeting called the World Molecular Imaging Congress (WMIC), are
changing the fields of oncology, infectious disease, neurology, cardiology, rheumatology, and endocrinology. A
distinguishing feature of the WMIS is the highly-integrated, multimodal nature of its program that begins with
scientific innovation and extends to patient care. As an international scientific educational organization, active
members of WMIS include basic and translational scientists, clinicians, young researchers and students from a
wide variety of disciplines, with a common goal of understanding human biology and the critical cellular and
molecular components of disease through in vivo imaging with quantitative multimodality MI. As an annual event,
the WMIC is the only comprehensive, international meeting in the field of MI. The WMIC provides a platform for
a wide array of scientists and clinicians with diverse areas of expertise to interact, present, and discuss cutting-
edge advances in MI, and as such the meeting attracts scientists from academia, industry, and government. The
main goal of the WMIC 2024 is to explore the expanding role of Molecular Imaging and its impact on advancing
in healthcare. We will accomplish this by the following aims of this proposal: 1) presenting the latest advances
and applications of MI; 2) improving the understanding of biological processes and using the gained insights to
develop imaging and therapies that help us to better prevent, detect and treat disease; and 3) bring together an
international community to promote and expand the use of MI to build a thriving scientific community that fosters
innovation through the creation of an equitable, diverse, and inclusive workforce. We work diligently to secure
travel funds for promising young scientists, post-doctoral and graduate students, to attend the meeting and to
bring their innovative studies to the meeting and are committed to supporting young investigators, as they drive
innovation in the field and apply MI in the clinic. The funds from this R13 will cover costs to support travel and
attendance for the most promising young investigators, at the graduate and postdoctoral levels, especially
encouraging women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities, enabling them to attend the
WMIC in Montreal on September 9 – 13, 2024."
10994019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. AD
encompasses a range of pathophysiologic processes including accumulation of amyloid-beta, neurofibrillary
tau tangles, neuronal degeneration, and neuroinflammation. There is now strong evidence suggesting that
changes in brain dynamics during sleep are related to development of underlying neuropathology. Previous
studies have examined correlations between scalp EEG features and coarse summary measures of PET
amyloid and tau, but the more precise link between neural electrophysiology and amyloid/tau pathology at
site-, region-, and network-levels has not yet been analyzed in detail. Characterizing these spatially and
functionally specific patterns is critical for future early detection of AD using sleep-related biomarkers,
development of sleep interventions to slow disease progression, and electrophysiological monitoring of
amyloid/tau-centric treatments. Meanwhile, over the past several years, our group has made significant
advances in EEG source localization methods that enable localization of cerebral currents in cortical and
subcortical regions at a resolution that is comparable to PET and fMRI. In this project, we propose to
measure high-density EEG during sleep in humans, alongside PET and MRI, across the stages of AD from
Preclinical to Mild Cognitive Impairment to mild AD dementia."
10993879,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Fatigue, the most distressing symptom, affects between 60-90% of all individuals with breast cancer. The
prevalence of fatigue increases to 80-96% when these individuals are receiving chemotherapy, a common
treatment modality. This high prevalence of fatigue is a concern for clinicians, patients, and their families as
fatigue is a debilitating symptom that interferes with the individual’s physical wellbeing, including their ability to
perform daily activities, and decreases social functioning. However, a lack of understanding of what causes
fatigue makes tailoring interventions to reduce fatigue difficult. Yet, while investigators have researched many
biological pathways in relation to fatigue, one mechanism that deserves further investigation is the oral
microbiome. Compelling evidence suggests that the microbiome influences symptoms such as fatigue and
physical well-being. Importantly, individuals with breast cancer have been found to have dissimilar oral
microbiomes to health controls, which are then further altered during chemotherapy. Additionally, studies on
individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome have suggested that the oral microbiome might play a role in the
development of fatigue. Given the high prevalence of fatigue experienced by individuals with breast cancer,
exploring this relationship between oral microbial changes, fatigue, and physical well-being is urgently needed.
Investigating the oral microbiome of individuals with breast cancer has the potential to inform our
understanding of the biological process of fatigue in a cancer that affects millions of individuals annually. The
objective of this longitudinal study is to inform our understanding of a biological mechanism associated with
fatigue and physical well-being and clarify the impact of chemotherapy on the oral microbiome in individuals
with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. This study will use data and biospecimens that have been
collected through the Duke University 1000 Patient Project (1KP). The 1KP project is an ongoing clinical data
repository in which patients, including individuals with breast cancer undergoing a mastectomy, are consented
for comprehensive data (demographics, disease, fatigue, and physical well-being) and biospecimen collection,
such as oral microbiome samples, at multiple timepoints pre and post operatively over the course of 6 months.
The aims are to: Aim 1. Characterize oral microbial changes (relative abundance, alpha diversity) prior to
chemotherapy and up to 6 subsequent months in 25 individuals with breast cancer. Aim 2. Explore whether
oral microbial changes (relative abundance, alpha diversity) are associated with fatigue and physical well-being
measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System in 25 individuals with breast
cancer receiving chemotherapy. Results from the proposed study will enhance the understanding of the
relationship between the oral microbiome and fatigue in individuals with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy
and inform future research on the creation of tailored intervention to ameliorate fatigue and enhance physical
well-being in individuals with breast cancer."
10992407,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal cancer of the female reproductive system, with over 21,000 new ovarian
cancer diagnoses and 14,000 deaths annually in the US. The total lifetime number of ovulations is a key risk
factor for developing ovarian cancer. Factors that repress ovulation reduce the risk of ovarian cancer, such as
oral contraceptives, pregnancy, lactation, and late menarche. The most common and deadly histotype of ovarian
cancer, termed high grade serous cancer (HGSC), likely originates from the fallopian tube epithelial cells, and
not the ovary. The frequent detection of tumors in the ovary, which resulted in the name “ovarian cancer”,
suggests that the ovary provides a unique anatomical location for tumor migration and expansion. Since most
research supports that the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE) is the source of ovarian cancer, it becomes critical to
understand how ovulation contributes to tumor initiation in this site. Our team developed three-dimensional
organotypic cultures supported in a state-of-the-art microfluidic platform that supports the ovary to produce
dynamic hormone profiles that closely mimic the 28-day human reproductive menstrual cycle and ovulation on
platform. This R01 renewal builds on this successful collaboration to expand our technology and models to
elucidate the mechanisms whereby blocking ovulation prevents FTE carcinogenesis and ovarian colonization.
We hypothesize that ovulation and the ovarian microenvironment contributes to the development FTE-derived
high grade serous tumors and that ovarian secreted factors drive primary metastasis. Aim 1 leverages our ability
to ovulate multiple ovaries in our MPS system called PREDICT-MOS to investigate mechanisms of
transformation. Using a unique panel of isogenic cell lines that include non-tumorigenic cells, preneoplastic lesion
models, and tumor models all derived from fallopian tube origin we will investigate how secreted factors from the
ovary produced during ovulation impact proliferation, soft agar colony formation, and spheroids. We will
determine if ovarian secretions increase DNA damage, replication stress, and copy number variation. Lastly, we
test if exposure to ovulation drives tumor formation. Aim 2 will focus on the notion that ovulation generates a
preneoplastic lesion and increased stemness through a secretory cell outgrowth using innovative iPSC-derived
fallopian tube organoids. Organoids will be engineered to model early tumor lesions and monitored in terms of
transformation in response to ovulation on platform. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanisms responsible
for fallopian tube tumor cell colonization of the ovary. Proteomics of ovulatory secretions found both versican
and IGF2 are higher after ovulation. We will investigate prevention of ovarian colonization by blocking versican
and IGF2 signaling in cell lines, 3D bioprinted models, primary tissue, and in vivo. Overall, this grant will employ
unique devices, primary human tissues, and three dimensional preneoplastic and tumor models to unveil new
biological targets to reduce tumor initiation and spread of fallopian derived high grade serous cancer in the
ovarian microenvironment."
10982411,"PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains an important treatment for hematologic
malignancies such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma, acute leukemias, and myelodysplastic syndromes.1 A key
component of HCT is the cytotoxic preconditioning required to reduce the burden of malignancy, suppress the
host immune system, and enable engraftment and tolerance of the donor hematopoietic cells.2 Unfortunately,
conditioning regimens invariably damage the tissues where donor cells engraft and expand (e.g., bone marrow
and thymus), leading to significant morbidity and mortality.1 Recent data suggests that radio-resistant thymus
vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are critical cells in endogenous thymus regeneration as they provide the conduit
for progenitor cell entry into the thymus, express ligands important for early thymic seeding, and secrete
regenerative associated factors (RAFs) such as BMP4.3–5 Understanding how the vascular network, and in
particular ECs, respond to cytotoxic therapy may give us insights that will enable the development of improved
therapies and restoration of adaptive immunity after acute injury.4,5 But how do these regimens change the
microenvironment of these tissues (especially the thymus) and impact the recovery of the hematopoietic and
adaptive immune systems? To address this question, we need new methods to directly analyze the live thymus
in its native site.6 Our previous intravital imaging work demonstrated that cytotoxic therapies drastically change
the bone marrow (BM) vascular integrity, oxygen tension (pO2), and cell behavior.7,8 In the thymus, we also
observe widespread changes in vascular structure suggesting functional damage. We hypothesize (a) that the
native cortical and CMJ vascular compartment is heterogenous with functionally distinct blood vessels; (b) that
these distinct vessels are made up of specific sub-types of ECs; (c) that this heterogeneity diminishes as the
thymus matures and/or after cytotoxic conditioning; and (d) that cytotoxic conditioning causes abnormal
hemodynamics in the blood vascular system leading to spatially and temporally restricted changes in blood flow,
vessel permeability, and tissue oxygenation. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following aims: (1) Utilize
novel high-resolution intravital imaging and two-photon oxygen microscopy to directly image and functionally
characterize the native thymic cortical and CMJ blood vascular physiology; (2) Define EC heterogeneity and
subtypes using flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing, and immunostaining and identify age dependent
functional and anatomical alterations in EC and vascular heterogeneity; and 3) Utilize high-resolution imaging
and two-photon phosphorescence oxygen microscopy to characterize the thymus microenvironment over time
after myeloablative (MAC) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) to identify physiological changes impacting
the recruitment of progenitors to the thymus in the context of HCT. The studies outlined in this proposal have the
potential to elucidate the microenvironmental effects of cytotoxic preconditioning on the thymus in ways that
have not been previously possible through use of novel imaging techniques for direct thymus evaluation."
10981619,"ABSTRACT
 Sickness behaviors represent a range of behavioral changes that manifest in response to infection or
inflammation. These changes include reduced physical activity, diminished social interaction, and altered feeding
behavior. It is suggested that these behavioral shifts are integral to the body's immune response against
pathogens, serving to conserve energy, deprive pathogens of nutrients, and contain the infection within the host's
community. Nevertheless, the mechanisms behind the initiation of sickness behaviors at the level of neurons
and neural circuits remain largely unexplored. This research endeavors to fill this knowledge gap by identifying
a neural substrate that acts as a point of interaction between the immune and nervous systems.
 Cytokines, signaling molecules produced by various immune cells, play a pivotal role in mounting the
body's immune response against pathogenic threats. A growing body of evidence suggests that cytokines can
also function as neuromodulators by acting on receptors expressed on neurons within the central nervous
system. IL-1β is one such cytokine that has been strongly associated with the generation of sickness behaviors.
In support of this idea, our data has revealed enrichment of its receptor, IL-1R1, within the dorsal raphe nucleus
(DRN), a brain region well-known for its involvement in regulating behaviors altered during sickness. These
observations suggest that IL-1β might act directly on IL-1R1-expressing neurons of the DRN (IL-1R1DRN) to
promote the expression of sickness behaviors.
 In this application, we will test this hypothesis using a range of molecular, genetic, and systems
neuroscience methods. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will comprehensively examine IL-1R1 expression in the DRN
and monitor the activity of DRN neurons in response to IL-1β and inflammation. In Aim 2, we will manipulate the
activity of IL-1R1DRN neurons to investigate their role in modulating sickness behaviors. We will also explore
whether IL-1 receptor expression itself in the DRN is essential for generating sickness behaviors. Finally, in Aim
3, we will identify downstream targets of IL-1R1DRN neurons that mediate sickness behaviors while
simultaneously asking whether IL-1R1DRN relies on a single target to induce all sickness behaviors or if it utilizes
different targets for generating distinct types of sickness behaviors.
 In summary, our study will identify IL-1R1DRN and its associated targets as the primary neural circuits
influenced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in driving behavioral changes during sickness. Successful
completion of this research will offer neural circuit-focused insights into how changes in the immune system
under inflammatory conditions can lead to corresponding alterations in behavior."
10980876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Athymic patients, or those born without a thymus, have a complete absence of functional T cells; such patients
will die within the first two years of life without functional T cells from complications associated with
immunodeficiency. There are several causes of athymia, including 22q11.2 deletion (i.e., DiGeorge Syndrome),
which is estimated to occur in 1 in 3,000 to 6,000 live births with reports suggesting even higher prenatally (as
frequent as 1 in 992). Roughly 0.5-1% of these patients have a complete lack of T cells called Complete
DiGeorge. These patients all require a thymic implant to restore T cells in their immune system to prevent death.
Current treatment approaches rely on harvesting primary tissue from children during open-heart procedures, an
approach that is not scalable and is limited by scarcity of tissues. Moreover, supply is further limited as there
must be minimal HLA matching between donor and recipient, which may contribute to post-thymus implant
autoimmunity. Thymmune Therapeutics, Inc. (“Thymmune”) has developed proprietary insights in thymic
differentiation from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and is using this knowledge to develop a cell-based
therapy (“THY-001”) for patients with athymia that addresses the key issues associated with current
treatment methods (i.e., collection and availability of tissues). The Thymmune team has a collective 100+
years of drug development experience to support this effort. Importantly, our previous development work has
shown that upon transplantation, our thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPs) differentiate in vivo into thymic
epithelial cells (TECs), forming thymic like tissues, though the composition of these grafts are variable. In this
SBIR Fast Track proposal, Thymmune will improve upon its existing protocol to produce its TEPs in a scalable
and reproducible manner necessary for clinical applications and establish the thymopoietic potential of this
therapy in vivo for the treatment of athymia. In Phase I, we will develop a differentiation protocol for TEPs in full
suspension conditions to enable industrial scale-up of THY-001 and derive a set of biomarkers that can be used
to define the cell product in anticipation of regulatory requirements for taking THY-001 into the clinic. In Phase II
work, we will test the in vivo function of the iPSC-TEPs that we have developed following our optimized protocol
developed in Phase I. Also in Phase II, we will develop a protocol for thymic engraftment in skeletal muscle
transplantation since current practices for thymic cell tissue therapy experiments in animals transplant tissue
directly into the subrenal capsule, which is not a clinically viable site. This SBIR Fast Track proposal will
establish the necessary protocols for commercial production of TEPs, determine their efficacy in vivo,
and establish a translatable method for transplantation to advance THY-001, Thymmune’s stem-cell
derived thymic cell therapy to treat patients with athymia. Following this work, we will test our cell product
in large pre-clinical animal model and prepare for submission of pre-IND and IND applications."
10981084,"OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) Center for Climate and Health
Equity (CECHE) unites multi-disciplinary researchers including cutting edge climate scientists with
epidemiologists, physicians, exposure and data scientists, community engagement scholars, urban planners
and health policy experts to advance cutting-edge climate health research. These interdisciplinary teams are
critical in identifying innovative solutions to promote equity and address climate change threats in urban areas.
CECHE's vision is to use team science and a cumulative impacts framework to advance innovative solutions-
based research and policies to combat climate health inequity and fulfill its mission of responding to priorities of
the most vulnerable environmental justice (EJ) communities in Chicago, the nation, and beyond. The center’s
initial research theme “nature-based solutions for mitigating adverse climate health impacts in Chicago and
beyond” is in direct response to community partner priorities. As a minority-serving institution, ranked 13th
among top public universities and 8th in social mobility, UIC is an ideal institution to establish CECHE and
promote diverse perspectives into climate change and health research. The Administrative Core (AC) will
provide overall management and evaluation of the Center's activities. An internal advisory committee, external
advisory committee, and community advisory board will govern the AC. The AC will also support
communication across the center, support career advancement, and create a pilot project program to
accelerate innovative climate and health research. The Community Outreach and Engagement Core (COEC)
will use an iterative process for capacity building and identification of climate solutions working in collaboration
with community EJ partners, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Using a train-the-trainer model, COEC
will also establish a Climate Health Institute to build capacity and train community health ambassadors within
EJ communities. COEC leaders, with EJ partners, will also conduct innovative urban health design studies to
create nature-based toolkits for promoting health benefits of green infrastructure (GI) and policy development
at local, regional, and national levels. The Geospatial Data Analysis Core (GDAC) will build a highly resolved
spatiotemporal data architecture linking GI with environmental factors (PM2.5, O3, heat, flooding), electronic
health records, and different types of nature-based GI features across multiple spatial and temporal scales,
advancing multidisciplinary nature-based research. These scales include satellite imagery of tree canopy, the
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and Google Street View with land use and cover data. The
Research Project will examine how features of urban GI 1) impact air quality and heat islands, 2) mitigate
flooding, and 3) influence cardio-respiratory outcomes such as hospitalizations and ED/ER visits in Chicago.
Over time, CECHE will work with other Climate and Health Centers to become a pioneer in urban climate
health equity and share innovative strategies for building climate-resilient and healthy communities."

interventions are fragmented with limited quantitative or qualitative health assessments; 2) transdisciplinary,
community-driven and team science training is limited across disciplines and for junior investigators; and 3)
community partners need additional capacity and support to advocate for community solutions to complex
climate and health challenges facing urban populations. The AC aims to overcome these gaps and will ensure
overall success of the center by addressing several specific aims. It will work to Develop and maintain an
administrative infrastructure and serve as a centralized hub (AIM1 )to provide scientific leadership and fiscal
management, coordinate center activities, and optimize the use of shared resources promote the mission and
vision of CECHE. A centralized website and social media platforms will be used to build external awareness of
center resources and engage the public in the center’s activities. Build capacity for and catalyze new
collaborative climate change and health research (Aim 2) across UIC and the Chicago Metropolitan Area by
supporting community partner-driven research and the translation of research findings into nature-based
solutions to improve environmental health equity. We will use evidence-based team science approaches to
accelerate multidisciplinary research, including organizing symposia, workshops, annual retreats, and
Community Café seminars. A pilot award program and a mini-grant program for community partners will
support capacity building and advance interdisciplinary research. Foster career development, accelerate
success of new investigators and implement a plan for enhancing diverse perspectives across CECHE (Aim 3)
by pairing senior and junior investigators across colleges; providing career development programming,
including grant writing workshops and editing services; and training climate science, engineering, urban
planning, medical and public health researchers for multi-disciplinary climate and health research. To ensure
rigor and success the AC will also monitor and evaluate all center activities and support a data integration plan.
This will enable growth and sustainability of CECHE as a vibrant center for urban climate health equity
research. Metrics and outcomes from each core will be tracked, including collaborative partnerships, pilot and
other external grants, peer review publications, career advancement, and integration of community partner and
other key stakeholders throughout all center activities. As Chicago’s flagship “hub” to improve environmental-
related health equity, CECHE will catalyze transdisciplinary research programs in Chicago and beyond."
10978241,"In ribosomopathies, perturbed expression of ribosome components leads to tissue-specific phenotypes, such
as limb and craniofacial defects as well as bone marrow failure. A key example of a ribosomopathy is Diamond
Blackfan Anemia (DBA) which results in an erythroid-specific disease manifestation. What accounts for such
tissue-selective manifestations as a result of mutations in the ribosome, a ubiquitous cellular machine, has
remained a mystery. Our preliminary data strongly support that translational dysfunction may contribute to
disease pathogenesis. In particular, our findings show that translational specificity to gene expression upon
ribosomal protein (RP) haploinsufficiency may arise from an intermediary pathway, the p53-4E-BP1-eIF4E
axis, which becomes activated and links RP haploinsufficiency to selective changes in cap-dependent
translation, namely mRNAs with structured 5’UTRs that require eIF4A helicase activity or that have a specific
sequence element. This preliminary data strongly supports the rationale to examine translational control and
protein synthesis within the hematopoietic compartment, which has been previously unattainable to resolve
and has limited our understanding of DBA pathogenesis. Strikingly, while it has been known for over 20 years
that RP mutations lead to bone marrow failure associated with ribosomopathies, there has not been any
genome-wide studies to pinpoint specific translation impairments underlying hematological abnormalities in-
vivo. This is at least in part due to a technical limitation in being able to employ technologies such as ribosome
profiling analysis for small numbers of cells. In Aim 1, we will utilize a new technology optimized for small cell
numbers to characterize the translational landscape of gene expression for the first time within the early
erythroid lineage of the hematopoietic compartment of a faithful DBA mouse model. This will enable
characterization of the global translation landscape of gene expression underlying hematopoietic dysfunction in
vivo in DBA for the first time. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that the translation factor 4EBP1 play a
causative role in alterations in transcript-specific translational control underlying DBA disease pathogenesis
and address the fundamental question of whether shared structural features are present in the 5’UTRs of
selective mRNAs that account for specificity to gene expression changes underlying ribosomopathies. In Aim
3, we will undertake a state-of-the-art chemical screen to, for the first time, identify translational activators that
have the potential to transform the treatment of DBA. In particular, by leveraging over 130,000 diverse
compounds available at the High Throughput Screening Knowledge Center (HTSKC), the chemical space will
allow for mechanistically novel hits to emerge, including those that directly target the protein synthesis
machinery. Together, this proposal holds the potential to transform our understanding and treatment of an
entire class of human diseases."

KCNH2 encodes the pore-forming subunits of the voltage-gated potassium channel called hERG1. Loss-of-
function KCNH2 variants cause the cardiac disorder long QT syndrome type II and are linked with intrauterine
fetal death and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Clinical data suggest that the mechanisms of sudden
cardiac death differ in the immature and mature myocardia, but how KCNH2 variants trigger sudden cardiac
death in the immature heart is not fully understood. We identified a novel KCNH2-encoded protein (hERG1NP)
that is targeted to the nuclei of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent
stem cells. hERG1NP, which mapped to the distal hERG1 C-terminal domain (Distal-CT), is targeted to the
nucleus by a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) within the hERG1NP N-terminus. Using hERG1’s distal C-
terminal domain (Distal-CT) as a surrogate for hERG1NP, we found that co-expressing the Distal-CT with the full-
length hERG1 channel reduces hERG1 current density and alters hERG1 channel gating, compared to GFP
controls. Deleting the NLS from the Distal-CT abolished its targeting to the nucleus and its effects on hERG1
currents. These data demonstrate that the putative hERG1NP is a regulator of hERG1 function and that hERG1
regulation by the Distal-CT is dependent upon targeting into the cell nucleus. In this grant we will use molecular
biology, site-directed mutagenesis, and confocal microscopy to identify the nascent hERG1NP polypeptide and
define the mechanisms that regulate hERG1NP biogenesis and activity in cardiac tissues. We will also use patch
clamp electrophysiology, confocal microscopy, and molecular biology to define the mechanisms by which
hERG1NP regulates hERG1 channel function and cardiac electrophysiology. Last, we will use two new gene-
edited stem cell lines: (1) a cell line where hERG1NP expression is selectively disrupted, and (2) a double knock-
in line carrying a KCNH2 mutation within the hERG1 NLS that disrupts nuclear targeting of the hERG1NP. We
will use these lines to define the impact of hERG1NP on cardiac currents (INa, ICa, IKs, Ito, & IK1) and identify
mechanisms of proarrhythmia subsequent to hERG1NP dysfunction. We will also measure the impact of hERG1NP
on cardiomyocyte development and maturation, and identify targets of hERG1NP activity (RNAseq & ChIP-Seq).
The overall goal of this work is to define mechanisms regulating cardiac hERG1NP function, the role of hERG1NP
in cardiac physiology, and mechanisms by which hERG1NP dysfunction contributes to human disease."
10978544,"One-in-four adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experiences a major adverse cardiac
event (MACE). Critically, individuals who experience MACE are 4-5 times more likely to die than those with
pneumonia alone. Hospitalization for CAP is also tied to a greater risk of MACE (up to 10-fold within 30 days of
hospitalization) and cardiovascular (CV)-associated death in convalescence for at least 5 years. Thus,
pneumonia damages the heart and this is linked to MACE and CV-associated death during and after
hospitalization. Of note, studies on Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), a Gram-positive bacterium and the leading
cause of CAP, have historically focused on events that occur in the respiratory and nervous systems. Indeed,
although Spn-mediated cardiac damage/dysfunction is now well-established clinical problem, no specific
treatment is available to combat this devastating condition. To address this unmet medical need, we will focus
on identifying potential mitigation strategies to alleviate the cardiac damage following pneumococcal disease.
Our preliminary studies have revealed the excessive recruitment of multiple components of the S100A8/9-
NLRP3-IL-1β signaling circuit in the heart of Spn-infected animals. Therefore, aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
the S100A8/9-NLRP3-IL-1β signaling circuit is critical to mediate Spn-induced excessive cardiac inflammation,
adverse remodeling, and dysfunction. These studies will be accomplished by employing a combination of mouse
genetic models (S100A9 and NLRP3 knockouts (KOs)) and pharmacological agents (S100A9 inhibitor
(Paquinimod, in vivo), and NLRP3 inhibitor (CY-09, in vivo)). Although macrophages (MΦs) are heterogeneous,
a distinction has emerged between circulating monocyte-derived C-C chemokine receptor 2+ (CCR2+) MΦs that
prolong inflammation (detrimental), versus tissue-resident or circulating CCR2- MΦs, which are critical to resolve
inflammation and promote healing (protective). Our preliminary studies revealed excessive cardiac recruitment
of proinflammatory CCR2+ MΦs in Spn-infected hearts, which persist in the myocardium even after antibiotic
clearance of the infection. Hence, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that Spn promotes adverse cardiac remodeling
by excessive recruitment of proinflammatory CCR2+ MΦs. CCR2 KO mouse model and novel anti-CCR2
monoclonal antibody (MC-21) will be employed to determine whether inhibiting the CCR2+ axis attenuates the
Spn-mediated adverse myocardial remodeling. Thus, proposed studies will identify novel mechanisms by which
detrimental profibrotic and prolonged inflammation could be selectively targeted without hampering the
repairing/healing mechanisms. The human relevance of critical findings from the mouse model will be accessed
with blood samples from CAP patients. The interventional studies for mitigation approaches with the mouse
model will be further validated in the human cardiac tissue chip (heart-on-a-chip) model. We are confident that
accomplishing the proposed studies will put us in an ideal situation to carry out a modes clinical trial to alleviate
the cardiac burden of CAP patients."

Offspring of mothers with depression are 2 to 3 times more likely than offspring of never-depressed mothers to
develop anxiety and depressive disorders. Meta-analytic work shows that relations between maternal
depression and offspring internalizing symptoms are stronger in younger than older children, highlighting the
critical need to study causal risk mechanisms early in development among these high-risk (HR) youth to
develop targeted prevention efforts. Across studies, HR youth are characterized by alterations within the NIMH
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) construct of Positive Valence Systems (PVS). Specifically, reduced reward
responsiveness (RR), a PVS subconstruct, is consistently observed across behavioral and brain units in HR
youth and predicts internalizing symptoms during adolescence, suggesting that reduced RR represents a key
vulnerability marker to target with prevention efforts for HR youth. Yet, previous research in this area has
focused predominantly on adolescent samples despite increasing evidence that PVS impairments are apparent
in preschool-aged youth across internalizing disorders. Prior studies examining PVS function in HR samples
are also largely limited by a single PVS assessment, limiting our understanding of how maternal depression
impacts both overall levels and trajectories of PVS function in offspring during early development. To address
these gaps, we will use an innovative, multimodal, accelerated longitudinal design to chart trajectories of PVS
function across early childhood in a large sample (N=450) of biological offspring of mothers with and without
depression histories recruited across two sites. Children, ages 4-6 at baseline, will complete developmentally
sensitive tasks evoking neural (event-related potentials) and behavioral indicators of RR to tangible and social
rewards at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-ups, resulting in trajectories of PVS function from 4 to 8 years.
We will assess factors that protect against or exacerbate alterations in PVS development to identify HR youth
who could most benefit from PVS-related interventions. Specifically, our data suggest that maternal positive
emotion behaviors (i.e., positive affect, parenting, and socialization) can buffer against maternal depression
effects on child PVS function, whereas exposure to early life adversity (ELA), particularly deprivation
experiences, potentiates effects. Thus, maternal positive emotion behaviors and child ELA exposure at
individual and community-levels will be assessed at every time point, along with parent and clinician-rated
assessments of child’s internalizing symptoms and disorders. This unique design will allow us to examine the
effects of maternal depression on overall PVS levels and developmental trajectories in offspring during early
childhood (Aim 1), test PVS function as a mechanism of maternal depression effects on early-emerging
internalizing symptoms (Aim 2) and examine key risk and protective factors that moderate effects of maternal
depression on child PVS function (Aim 3). Findings from the project may lead to novel PVS prevention efforts
that could be delivered during early child development to break intergenerational risk cycles more effectively."
10985353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, particularly those that affect motor function and pain sensitivity are
major clinical challenges. Current medications are not curative and only address secondary symptoms of
disease. To restore peripheral nerve function after injury, Schwann cells adapt to counteract pathological insults
by undergoing a dramatic transformation to generate repair cells. This complex process, termed
transdifferentiation, requires coordination between multiple signaling and gene regulation programs. During
transdifferentiation Schwann cell myelination, metabolism, adhesion, phagocytic properties and the ability to
activate the immune system are adapted to preserve neuronal survival and function. Transcriptional studies of
nerve injury models have revealed that several canonical signaling pathways are altered after injury, including:
NF-kB, Ras, TGFβ, WNT, and MAPK. Despite the clear upregulation of WNT signaling components, how WNT
signaling contributes to the generation of the repair cell is unclear. Poor understanding of the molecular systems
controlling repair cell formation and function is a critical barrier towards identifying therapeutic targets to treat
nerve injury. We now have the genetic, sequencing and viral tools to dissect how signaling pathways individually
contribute to each of the hallmark repair cell phenotypes. We hypothesize that WNT signaling mediates repair
cell formation by promoting transdifferentiation and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of repair cells. This
grant will 1) provide functional tests of the role of WNT receptors and ligands in the control of repair cell formation
2) determine whether reduction of a WNT antagonist can restore peripheral nerve regeneration after injury. To
accomplish these goals, I will leverage my training in disease models of peripheral neuropathy to gain experience
in four critical areas: (1) viral vector design of CRISPR/Cas9 tools, and (2) RNA detection and quantification
techniques, (3) mechanisms of cellular reprogramming, and (4) professional development. To achieve these
training goals, I have assembled an exceptional group of mentors and scientific advisors with specialties in
understanding the roles that glia play during development, injury and neurodegeneration, virus-mediated
CRISPR/Cas9 delivery, and transcriptomics of myelinated tissues. With expert guidance from this group, the
proposed experiments will address the cellular mechanisms of repair cell induction. The results from this
application will serve as the basis for an R01 application to dissect how WNT signaling components orchestrate
the changes in transcription required to reprogram mature Schwann cells into repair cells and test whether WNT
intersects with other relevant intracellular pathways (e.g. MAPK, ERK) during Schwann cell reprogramming.

This K23 application outlines a career development plan that will advance Dr. Michael Devinney on his pathway
to becoming an extramurally funded, independent critical care physician-scientist. His long-term career goal is
to discover underlying mechanisms that contribute to delirium and its sequelae such as post-ICU cognitive
impairment and Alzheimer's Disease and related Dementias (ADRD).
Delirium is a syndrome of disrupted attention and consciousness that occurs in ~20% of the >19 million older
surgery patients and ~50% of the >5 million intensive care unit (ICU) patients in America every year. Delirium is
also associated with increased risk for long-term cognitive impairment and ADRD, yet there are no FDA-
approved drugs to prevent delirium, due to a major gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive
delirium. One possible mechanism that may underpin delirium (and subsequent post-ICU long-term cognitive
impairment) is neuroinflammation. Surgical trauma and critical illness induce systemic complement activation
and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, which could cause activated complement factors to enter the brain. These
activated complement proteins then can cause synaptic tagging for phagocytosis, which can disrupt the neural
connectivity necessary for human cognition. Indeed, complement-dependent synapse loss leads to memory
deficits in mouse ADRD models, and patients with ADRD have increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) C3 levels.
However, few, if any, studies have investigated the role of CSF complement activation in delirium and post-ICU
long-term cognitive impairment. In this proposal, Dr. Devinney will determine the role of CSF complement
activation in postoperative delirium, ICU delirium, and post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment. To do so, he will
leverage a unique perioperative CSF biorepository, and also recruit a prospective cohort of 120 older ICU
patients that will undergo CSF sampling, delirium assessments, and 6-month post-discharge cognitive testing
and dementia assessments. CSF complement activation will be measured with immunoassays, and unbiased
proteomics will be used to characterize CSF complement levels and to discover other novel pathways involved
in these disorders. CSF ADRD biomarkers will also be measured in both cohorts.
Dr. Devinney has co-designed a career development plan and a research proposal with his cross-disciplinary
mentorship team to accomplish the following short-term objectives: 1) Obtain expertise in the molecular role of
complement in synaptic dysfunction and ADRD 2) Develop a thorough understanding of the practical and ethical
considerations of ICU research, 3) Acquire the skills needed to lead larger studies of older ICU patients, and 4)
Gain expertise in the staging of ADRD. These objectives will be accomplished through formal training,
workshops, experiential learning, and focused mentorship. Thus, this K23 award will allow Dr. Devinney to
acquire the outlined research skills, knowledge, and experience to continue his pathway towards independence."

 In utero, organized and predetermined patterns of auditory structural and neural pathway
development set the stage for early language acquisition.15 The very low birth weight (VLBW)
preterm infant, born at 24-30 weeks gestation is at a critical stage of structural and functional
auditory development in a suboptimal environment.3, 15 The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU),
vastly different from the protected uterine environment, is full of high pitched alarms and harsh
mechanical sounds from lifesaving respiratory equipment positioned in close proximity to
developing auditory structures,8 putting VLBW infants at significant risk for speech and language
delays.2, 3 Compounding the suboptimal ambient auditory environment, NICU hospitalization leads
to sparse exposure to directed speech,210, 211 which has been correlated with poorer neurocognitive
outcomes on Bayley III testing at 18-36 months of age.2, 4 Preliminary data from our going
longitudinal project with VLBW preterm infants form birth through 18 months suggest that speech
input continues to be limited post NICU hospitalization. Further, delays in vocabulary growth are
already observed by their first birthday, although large variability exists.
 The proposed project harnesses our existing VLBW preterm cohort to examine how gestational
age, health and demographic factors, and initial language development trajectories, influenced by
parent-child communication patterns, contribute to the rapid emergence of language typically
observed in the second to third year of life. To capture this critical developmental phase, we will
follow the current cohort of VLBW preterm infants through 36 months (corrected age), longitudinally
collecting measures of quantitative (e.g., adult word count) and qualitative language input (e.g.,
proportion of infant- vs adult-directed speech, contingent responding) and language proficiency
(i.e., vocabulary size, speech processing efficiency, online novel word learning, Bayley IV
developmental scores), and compare their trajectories of language growth with those of age-
matched full-term infants. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of
factors that impact risk and resilience for language growth over time, both in full-term neurotypical
infants and in an at-risk preterm population. Examining factors associated with variability and timing
of language emergence within the VLBW preterm population compared to age-matched full-term
infants will inform our understanding of why some infants struggle while others flourish. Early
identification of infants at increased risk for language delays will provide opportunities for early and
targeted interventions to ameliorate health through improved language outcomes."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) enable anti-tumor immunity by blocking immunoregulatory receptor-ligand
interactions (e.g., programmed cell death protein 1 [PD-1] and its ligand [PD-L1]). Despite their widespread
success as an anti-cancer therapy, ICIs function poorly in patients with bone metastases, and bone loss
and elevated fracture risk are reported in patients receiving ICI therapy. My preliminary data indicate that
PD-1 global knockout or pharmacologic blockade decreases bone mass in both tumor naïve mice and mice with
bone-metastatic disease (E0771 tumor cells). Furthermore, PD-1 blockade reduces bone strength compared to
IgG control treatment in mice with bone metastases. These data are consistent with reports of bone loss and
fractures in patients treated with ICIs. I have also found that osteoclast activity and CD8+ T cell populations
capable of secreting pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines are elevated in the bone marrow after PD-1 blockade. I
therefore hypothesize that the detrimental effects of PD-1 blockade on bone stem from CD8+ T cell
expansion, which promotes osteoclast-induced bone destruction, and that tumor resistance to ICIs in
the bone microenvironment stems from T cell dysfunction. I propose to (1) determine how immune cells
influence PD-1 blockade-induced bone loss, and (2) investigate the mechanism behind T cell dysfunction and
tumor resistance to ICIs in the bone microenvironment. In Aim 1 (F99 phase), I will use T cell depletion and
adoptive transfer studies to investigate the role of bone marrow immune cells on PD-1 blockade-induced bone
loss in tumor-inoculated mice. I will also treat tumor-inoculated mice with α-PD-1 in combination with
bisphosphonates to assess prevention of bone loss. In both of these studies, I will assess the bone phenotype
via microCT and biomechanical strength testing, and the tumor and immune phenotypes via flow cytometry and
histology. In Aim 2 (K00 phase), I will utilize digital spatial profiling and scRNAseq technology to characterize T
cell infiltration into bone metastases and identify key signaling pathways between tumor cells, immunoregulatory
cells (myeloid derived suppressor cells, tumor associated macrophages T regulatory cells) and cytotoxic T cells,
which are important in escape of bone metastatic tumor cells from the T cell anti-tumor response. I will use de-
identified human breast cancer samples to validate my findings and elucidate the mechanism(s) by which bone
metastases escape T cell surveillance (e.g., T cell suppression, T cell exhaustion, lack of T cell infiltration into
the tumor microenvironment, etc.). With the current lack of understanding of the mechanism behind bone loss in
patients treated with ICIs and tumor cell resistance to ICIs after bone dissemination, this proposal will help
manage bone health in the millions of patients receiving ICIs each year and confirm mechanistically whether
anti-resorptives reverse ICI-induced bone loss. Furthermore, I will uncover novel mechanisms of bone metastatic
immune evasion that, when targeted, may increase efficacy of ICIs in bone metastatic patients."

Early signs of age-related cognitive decline are associated with deficits in novelty processing. Older individuals
often mistake new events for familiar ones. This bias for familiarity is thought to cause memory interference,
which occurs when established memories from everyday life interfere with newly acquired information. The
brain dysfunctions promoting the reactivation of familiar memories and causing interference in aging remain
unknown. Studies show that older adults with reduced familiarity bias exhibit enhanced cognitive abilities,
emphasizing the need to investigate the neural circuits involved in familiarity and memory interference in aging.
In older adults, reduced LEC activity is linked to difficulty distinguishing new from familiar objects, indicating
insufficient activation by novelty-signaling inputs. The exact circuit changes that give rise to this dysfunction
have not been identified. Our latest research suggests that dopamine neurons (DANs) that project to the LEC
in mice deteriorate with age. Previously, we demonstrated that inhibiting DANs in young mice — thereby
simulating the aging effect — leads to a bias towards familiarity. Based on these findings, we propose that
aging-related decline in DAN functions predisposes the LEC to prioritize familiarity, enhancing memory
interference. In this project, we seek to investigate how dysfunction in LEC-projecting DANs affects memory
interference in old mice, using the latent inhibition paradigm. We will examine the role of LEC DA release in
promoting familiarity processing in Aim 1 and assess DANs' effect on reactivating neuronal representations of
familiar memories in the LEC in Aim 2. Experiments in Aim 1 will use fiber photometry and optogenetic
manipulations to measure DA transients in the LEC during the transition from novelty to familiarity and
establish a role of DA in memory interference. Aim 2 will determine if reactivation of neuronal representations
of familiar stimuli in the LEC during a recall phase is necessary to produce memory interference. We will use
activity-dependent tagging strategies to label neuronal presentations in the LEC and examine their modulation
by DANs. The project will determine the LEC microcircuits involved in proactive memory interference and will
build the foundation for further inquiry into why older adults are biased towards familiarity, hindering novelty
detection and learning in rapidly changing environments."

 Recent evidence from genetics, neuroimaging and postmortem studies collectively points to synaptic
pathways as a locus of pathophysiologic mechanisms of schizophrenia. In particular, dysregulation of
glutamatergic signaling has been among the most highly implicated for synaptic pathology of the illness.
Previously, we proposed Src kinase (Src) as one of the points of convergence for multitudes of molecular
alterations in glutamatergic complexes in the postsynaptic density (PSD) in schizophrenia. Our scientific
premise is that Src kinase and its aberrant associations with its binding partners form a
pathophysiologic subnetwork underlying altered PSD/glutamatergic signaling and thus represent
potential therapeutic targets. This premise is predicated on a series of observations we have made including
1) NMDA receptor (NMDAR) hypoactivity in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of
schizophrenia is associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2 in NMDAR complexes. 2)
NMDAR hypoactivity is driven by hypoactivity of Src kinase, which results from aberrant protein-protein
interaction (PPI) of Src with its signaling partners. 3) Molecular and behavioral phenotypes of NMDAR
hypoactivity can be rescued by modifying altered Src-PSD-95 association using a peptide, called Src activating
PSD-95 inhibiting peptide (SAPIP). Synaptic alterations lead to disrupted circuit activity via aberrant
interactions between pyramidal neurons (PNs) and interneurons (INs). The goal of this project is to determine
Src mediated NMDAR signaling alterations distinctly in PNs vs. INs and their differential responses to
potential therapeutic interventions. Previous postmortem assessments of glutamatergic signaling, by our lab
and others, were conducted in bulk tissues, not offering a cell type specific resolution. To address this, we will
employ two recently devised methods. The first is sequential immunoprecipitation (IP), in which the receptor
complexes in each cell type are captured first by GluN1, common to both cell types, followed by another round
of IP using a bait protein that is expressed exclusively in the cell type of interest and yet integral to the protein
complexes of interest. The second is multi-channel confocal microscopic analysis of synaptosomes combined
with cell type specific labeling and the proximity ligation assay (PLA). Employing these complementary
methods, we will examine postmortem DLPFC and test if Src kinase activity and their downstream signaling
are altered in PNs vs. INs in schizophrenia (Aim 1). In addition, we will examine how Src-NMDAR signaling is
modulated by SAPIP and other agents in each cell type (Aim 2). The results of this study will be the first to
address signaling and PPIs in postmortem brains in specific cell types and will inform the distinct constellation
of glutamatergic receptor complexes and signaling in pyramidal vs. interneurons."

Despite public health efforts to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), 11.7% of pregnant women in the U.S.
consume alcohol and 3.9% binge drink. PAE can lead to growth retardation, facial dysmorphology and
neurobehavioral disabilities, the key manifestations of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). Although the
growth deficits correlate with the cognitive and behavioral impairments, we lack mechanistic insight into the
basis for these growth deficits. A major driver of fetal growth deficits is maternal metabolic disruption, and
although alcohol is well-known to alter metabolism, surprisingly, this has been minimally investigated in PAE.
My preliminary data address this knowledge gap, and show that alcohol reduces maternal-fetal glucose pools,
with commensurate rise in fetal amino acid catabolites including urea. Although alcohol stimulates skeletal
muscle catabolism, I find no sign that this happens in alcohol-exposed dams. Instead, my preliminary studies
find that alcohol-exposed dams fail to undergo an expected adaptation to an insulin-resistant state. Moreover, I
find that alcohol-driven changes in maternal fasting glucose and insulin correlate with the alcohol-mediated
reductions in fetal body and brain weight. Launching from these data, this proposal uses an established mouse
model of PAE and tests the hypothesis that alcohol prevents the dam from entering an insulin-resistant
state, thus limiting fetal glucose availability, and thereby increasing fetal reliance on amino acids to
support gluconeogenesis instead of growth. The first phase of the K99 portion quantifies maternal-fetal
fed/fasted glucose levels, gluconeogenesis, and their related metabolite pools to understand how alcohol alters
maternal-fetal energetics to reduce fetal glucose availability. The second phase of the K99 portion quantifies
insulin signaling, and glucose storage and utilization in maternal liver, to test the hypothesis that alcohol
prevents maternal adaptation to insulin resistance. Finally, the R00 phase will identify the underlying
mechanism(s) that mediates this adaptive failure in alcohol-exposed dams, focusing on major candidate
drivers including leptin-resistance, and prolactin and placental lactogen activity. Future studies will test these
candidates functionally using organ-targeted transgenic and knockout mouse models. I will be trained in the
methodologies of whole-animal and cellular metabolic assessment and an in-depth understanding of
insulin/leptin signaling in pregnancy. I will also be trained in mouse behavioral assessment, looking toward
future studies of how these metabolic changes may impact cognitive function. This work provides novel,
mechanistic insight into the basis for the fetal growth deficits that typify FASD, focusing on key, heretofore
overlooked metabolic processes. These data may also inform the development of a metabolite fingerprint or
hormone test to identify at-risk pregnancies, and they will offer insights into nutrient-based interventions that
could improve gestational outcomes in those pregnancies."
10991547,"Anxiety disorders represent the most prevalent type of psychopathology across the lifespan. Fear/avoidance,
temperament precursors of anxiety symptoms, can be observed reliably in the first year of life. Thus, develop-
ment of fear, a critical component of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) negative valence constellation, is
important in its own right, and represents an early marker of anxiety symptoms. Fearful temperament has been
linked with a distinct neurophysiological signature – relative right frontal activation, detectable via electroen-
cephalogram (EEG) recording. Dynamic reciprocal effects between the left and right hemispheres contribute to
this asymmetry as well as associated behavioral states of fear/avoidance, and shape risk versus protection
with respect to anxiety. Maternal sensitivity not only effects fear development, but also moderates links be-
tween fear reactivity and anxiety symptoms. The present study addresses an important gap in research, exam-
ining reciprocal effects between changes in left and right frontal activation as a vehicle for transmission of anxi-
ety-related risk, along with fearful reactivity, considering maternal sensitivity as a moderator. It is hypothe-
sized that (1) dominance of right hemisphere change effects on left activation growth across infancy
and coupling of accelerated changes in infant fearfulness and shifts in the associated electrophysio-
logical signature will confer the risk for anxiety; (2) early maternal sensitivity will serve to attenuate
links between psychophysiological risk and anxiety, accentuating it later. The following specific aims are
proposed: Aim 1. Infant fearfulness: Modeling behavioral and EEG changes moderated by maternal sensitivity.
We will enroll mothers with infants (n=300) at three sites: Pullman, WA, Blacksburg, VA, and Jupiter, FL, re-
quired to provide racial/ethnic diversity in the overall sample recruited from otherwise demographically similar
communities, and because of data collection/processing demands associated with the longitudinal design. We
will conduct multi-method bimonthly assessments of infant fear from 6 to 18 months, relying on a planned
missingness design. Infant EEG will be recorded to measure frontal activation along with observations of ma-
ternal sensitivity. Dynamic latent change effects will be modeled for behavioral and EEG indicators, providing a
picture of development across infancy and setting the stage for Aim 2. Explaining anxiety onset: Contributions
of latent change in fear, electrophysiology, and sensitivity. Contributions of changes in fear and related electro-
physiology to the emergence of anxiety will be quantified, considering moderation of maternal sensitivity. Chil-
dren will be followed until 24 months of age, obtaining questionnaire and structured interview parent-report, as
well as observations of behavioral inhibition/anxious behaviors. Latent change scores for fear and frontal EEG
power on the left and the right will be modeled as predictors of anxiety, with maternal sensitivity as a moderator
of these links. Completion of the proposed evaluation is expected to clarify the role of fear development and
maternal sensitivity in the onset of anxiety symptoms, informing preventative efforts (e.g., parent training)."

critical role in sensory neurons such as olfactory neurons and photoreceptors. Specialized sensory neuron cilia
house all signal transduction molecules, and consequently, disruption of sensory cilia function as in ciliopathies
is associated with anosmia, loss of vision, and impaired hearing. Since cilia are directly exposed to the
environment, these structures are highly susceptible to damage by physical and chemical stimuli as well as
upon viral infection. Deciliation of olfactory neurons upon infection of sustentacular support cells by SARS-
CoV-2 is associated with the rapid onset of anosmia characteristic of this viral disease. Although olfactory
neuron cilia appear to partly regrow during recovery, the mechanisms regulating ciliary regeneration are
uncharacterized. Cilia/flagella in unicellular organisms have been shown to robustly regenerate following
truncation, and this regeneration is mediated in part via transcriptional upregulation of ciliary genes. However,
the mechanisms by which cilia growth state information is sensed and transduced to promote cilia regeneration
remains a major knowledge gap.
 In preliminary experiments, we have established conditions in which we can robustly induce
chemosensory neuron cilia truncation and regeneration in individual sensory neuron types in C. elegans. We
find that cilia regeneration requires a subset of conserved genes previously implicated in regulating axon
regeneration across species, and that moreover, induction of cilia regeneration is associated with upregulation
of a ciliogenic gene. The overall goal of this exploratory R21 is to exploit the experimental amenability of C.
elegans to identify the sensors, transducers, and effectors driving neuronal cilia regeneration and restoration of
chemosensory neuron functions.
The specific goals are to:
 Aim 1. Characterize the contribution of molecules implicated in axon regeneration to chemosensory
neuron cilia regrowth.
 Aim 2. Identify additional sensors, mediators, and effectors of cilia regrowth.
 Results from this exploratory work have the potential to identify new mechanisms by which cilia
regeneration is regulated in the nervous system, and how this regeneration is modulated as a function of
neuron type. Given the conservation of ciliogenic mechanisms, this work may identify potential therapeutic
strategies by which cilia structure and function can be restored following injury and infection across species."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. While
significant progress has been made in the past decades, our understanding of T1D pathogenesis remains far
from complete. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice develop spontaneous T1D and have been used extensively to
obtain mechanistic insight of this autoimmune disease. Pathogenic CD4 T cells promote T1D by secreting
inflammatory cytokines, enhancing the immunogenic functions of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and help
cytotoxic CD8 T cells that directly kill beta cells through the recognition of peptide-MHC I complexes.
Autoreactive T cells and APCs are controlled by FOXP3+ regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs), and defects
associated with Tregs have been reported in T1D patients. Recently, a diabetogenic role of CD4 T cell-derived
interleukin (IL)-21 has emerged. IL-21 promotes T1D development in part through its ability to support the
survival and function of diabetogenic CD8 T cells. Interestingly, NOD islet-infiltrating IL-21+ CD4 T cells have
a unique phenotype distinct from those in lymphoid tissues. Importantly, NOD mice genetically rendered IL-21-
deficient are completely resistant to diabetes. Significantly higher frequencies of circulating IL-21+ CD4 T cells
have been found in subjects with beta-cell autoimmunity than in healthy controls, consistent with a role of IL-21
in promoting T1D development in humans. Collective results from both mouse and human studies strongly
indicate a central role of IL-21+ beta-cell autoreactive CD4 T cells in T1D pathogenesis. Both genetic
susceptibility and environmental factors contribute to T1D development. The PTPN22 R620W variant is one of
the top genetic risk factors that are associated with T1D development in humans. PTPN22 has been shown to
regulate cells within the innate and adaptive immune systems, but additional effort is needed to identify its
T1D-related function. NOD mice deficient in PTPN22 or carrying the 619W knock-in allele (orthologous to
human 620W) developed accelerated autoimmune diabetes compared to the wildtype control, consistent with
its role in T1D. Our preliminary results showed that Ptpn22-/- CD4 T cells were more diabetogenic than the
wildtype counterpart. We further demonstrated by flow cytometry and paired single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) and scTCR-seq that CD4 T cells were more prone to be IL-21+ effectors than Tregs in islets of
NOD.Ptpn22-/- mice, supporting a role of PTPN22 in their fate decision at the site of autoimmune destruction.
The overall hypothesis is that PTPN22 regulates T1D by controlling the balance of IL-21+ CD4 T cells and
FOXP3+ Tregs. We will determine if the balance of IL-21+ CD4 T cells and FOXP3+ Tregs is altered by the
Ptpn22 619W risk allele and mechanistically identify how PTPN22 controls the differentiation and accumulation
of IL-21+ CD4 T cells and FOXP3+ Tregs. By completing the proposed experiments, we will be able to provide
important insight into the role of PTPN22 in CD4 T cell fate decision."

Nearly every adult in the United States will develop at least one cavity, with some individuals experiencing a
significantly higher incidence. While environmental factors like diet and oral hygiene are important, heritability
also plays a crucial role in determining oral health. Specifically, genetics accounts for up to 65% of the variation
between individuals in their experience with dental caries. Despite this, the identification of specific genetic
variants contributing to this heritability is still in its infancy. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS)
found a genetic variant, rs72694438, that is associated with the likelihood of needing dentures. This means that
something within that genomic region is influencing tooth health.
Interestingly, this variant is located near the gene(s) for salivary amylase, an enzyme that initiates starch
digestion in the mouth. Salivary amylase also has the ability to bind to commensal oral bacteria like
Streptococcus gordonii, potentially affecting their adhesion to teeth and their competition with cariogenic species
such as Streptococcus mutans. Some studies have suggested an association between the level of salivary
amylase and the level of dental caries. However, studying this locus is challenging because an individual can
have anywhere from 2 to >17 copies of the amylase gene, AMY1. This means conventional methods of counting
copies (such as qPCR) are insufficient and can lead to spurious and conflicting results. In addition, quantifying
tooth health across large numbers of people can be difficult and imprecise.
Here, I propose to use modern computational methods coupled with a densely phenotyped large cohort with
genetic data (UK Biobank, 500k samples) to overcome these problems with statistical power. In preliminary
analyses, I could accurately genotype AMY1 copy number and found that it is strongly associated with the
likelihood of requiring dentures (p = 2.31x10-19, OR for 2 to 17 copies = 1.41) and more weakly with bleeding
gums (p=0.0045, OR for 2 to 17 copies = 0.89). This association has one of the largest effect sizes for a common
genetic variant in dental health discovered to date.
I propose to fully characterize the structure of the amylase locus and its mechanisms for affecting tooth
health. For Aim 1, I will work to improve the copy number estimation and knowledge of the haplotype structure
at the amylase locus. For Aim 2, I will associate amylase copy number with dental phenotypes. For Aim 3, I will
associate AMY1 copy number with the abundance of bacterial taxa in the oral microbiome. Through these aims,
I intend to elucidate the mechanistic pathway linking this genetic variant to the oral microbiome and, ultimately,
to tooth health."
10995839,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF PARENT K08
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health problem, yet treatments demonstrate only modest
efficacy, likely due to the profound phenotypic heterogeneity of AUD. In order to improve the efficacy of AUD
treatments, it is imperative to better characterize this heterogeneity which may, in turn, elucidate clearer
treatment targets for precision medicine approaches. This likely requires shifting conceptualizations of AUD away
from clinical description and towards etiologic mechanisms, an approach embodied by the goals of some modern
conceptualizations of AUD, such as the Addiction Research Domain Criteria (AARDoC) and Addictions
Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA). However, current research suggests that AARDoC and ANA suffer from
important shortcomings, including limited clinical efficiency, and may therefore benefit from further development,
refinement, and validation. To address these shortcomings, the proposed project aims to (a) empirically test the
models articulated by modern conceptual AUD etiological frameworks, including the ANA, and (b) derive a
mechanism-based computerized adaptive test (CAT) assessment of AUD developed using principles of objective
test construction and community-based participatory research strategies. First, a candidate set of self-report
items indexing 13 etiologic domains articulated by the Etiologic, Theory-Based, Ontogenetic Hierarchical (ETOH)
framework of AUD mechanisms, which serves as a recent extension of AARDoC/ANA, will be derived from the
literature and two rounds of cognitive interviews will be used to refine the item set among a diverse group of
participants (N = 50) with hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Next, items will be administered to a combined
community and clinical sample (N = 1,200) to empirically test the structure of items and determine the best-fitting
model. Item response theory will then be used to calibrate the items for the purpose of building a CAT for each
of the domains identified (e.g., reward, cognitive control, negative emotionality). Using the refined and calibrated
item set and domain-specific CATs, data will be collected from an additional independent sample of heavy
drinkers (N = 100). Ecological momentary assessment over 14 days and a follow-up assessment will also be
conducted with the goal of evaluating the psychometric properties of the CATs in ecologically valid contexts and
over time. Specifically, to determine if the domain-specific CATs demonstrate validity (e.g., convergent,
discriminant, predictive) and reliability (e.g., test-retest) across diverse patient populations and sex/gender
groups. All research aims will be conducted alongside and in consultation with individuals with lived experience
of AUD to ensure the measure is acceptable, feasible, and adequately contextualized. This project is consistent
with NIAAA's Strategic Plan, specifically Goal 1 (Identify mechanisms of alcohol-related pathology) and Goal 2
(Improve diagnosis and tracking of AUD). The resulting measure also has the potential to support progress
towards Goal 4 (Develop and improve treatments for AUD) by facilitating the assessment of mechanisms that
may serve as viable targets in AUD treatments, including behavioral and pharmacological interventions.
PROJECT SUMMARY FOR PROPOSED ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT
This project proposes an administrative supplement to accompany the parent award, which is a Mentored Clinical
Scientist Career Development Award (K08AA030301; PI: Boness) entitled, Measurement and Multimethod
Validation of Alcohol Use Disorder Etiologic Mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed administrative supplement
would increase salary support for a current project coordinator as well as provide support for a graduate student.
This would help with the coordination of research activities, including administrative tasks and data management,
as I focus on the main research and training aims of the parent award. This additional personnel support will
therefore promote research continuity on the parent K08 award which aims to use a multimethod approach to
develop and validate a computerized adaptive test of alcohol use disorder etiologic mechanisms following a time-
limited period of parental leave."

The World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) tracks the ongoing health and well-being of first responders
and people who lived and worked near the World Trade Center. As WTCHP participants age, it is important to
identify pragmatic interventions to address their most common health conditions. Physical activity (PA) is a
lifestyle intervention that can improve fatigue and overall health, and lead to other beneficial lifestyle changes for
people with cancer. PA is safe in people with cancer, yet a majority do not meet exercise guidelines. Although
PA has many health benefits, interventions to support patients are not routinely incorporated into clinical practice.
Evidence-based guidelines recommend PA counseling in clinical care and health professionals strongly believe
they should be doing this. However, a gap remains in implementing PA interventions at the point of care. WTCHP
participants with cancer would benefit from an evidence-based motivational intervention to initiate or maintain
PA. In the proposed study, we will use a Hybrid Type II randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness and
implementation of a brief motivational intervention to increase PA in a sample of WTCHP participants with
cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test and implement a motivational intervention to support PA
within the WTCHP population.
The study will employ a randomized wait-list controlled trial with a Hybrid (effectiveness–implementation) Type
II design. Type II Hybrid designs test the effectiveness of a clinical intervention while simultaneously evaluating
an implementation approach for embedding the clinical intervention at the point of care. Aim 1 will determine the
effectiveness of a brief motivational intervention to increase PA in a group of WTCHP cancer survivors compared
to an enhanced standard of care. Aim 2 will test the feasibility and potential utility of theory-driven implementation
strategies to increase the adoption, fidelity, and sustainment of a brief motivational intervention to increase PA
in a group of WTCHP cancer survivors compared to an enhanced standard of care.
Participants will be randomized to the intervention plus a nutrition program or a nutrition program alone
(enhanced usual care). The intervention includes brief motivational components (motivational interviewing,
mobile health, and action planning) and participants will be encouraged to plan a PA program that fits their
lifestyle and abilities. The intervention will last 3 months with a 3-month maintenance follow-up. Following the 3-
month wait-list, participants in the control group will be offered the intervention.
Developing evidence-based lifestyle interventions has the potential to lead to sustained behavior change that
can alleviate health conditions and improve quality of life. The combination of testing effectiveness and
implementation strategies in this study will speed the incorporation of evidence-based physical activity
interventions at the point of care. After completing this research, the investigators will be poised to test the
implementation of a PA intervention into clinical care for WTCHP general participants."

The Innovative Network on the Science and Practice of Implementation, Research, and Engagement Center
(INSPIRE) seeks to advance the science and practice of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science
research in low-to-middle income countries by adapting, scaling up, and sustaining evidence-based HIV
interventions for adolescents and young adults (AYA). The Center offers a unique opportunity to conduct this
paradigm-shifting work as part of the Prevention and Treatment through a Comprehensive Care Continuum for
HIV-affected adolescents in resource-constrained settings implementation science network (PATC3H-IN).
Using an Appreciative Inquiry lens that focuses on the strengths within a system that fuels change, our mission
is to serve as a hub for optimizing synergistic D&I research that appreciates, coordinates, and magnifies
insights on adaptation, scalability, and sustainability with communities of interest from across the network via
our Capacity Supporting Core (CSC), Advanced Methods and Modeling Core (AAMC), and Community
Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC). Communities of interest in the six PATC3H-IN countries
(Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, South Africa, Zambia, Tanzania) include researchers, implementers, community
members, policymakers, and family members (especially guardians), friends, and adolescents and young
adults (AYA). Our vision aligns with global goals to end the HIV epidemic among AYA. Our specific aims are:
1) Design and deliver cutting-edge implementation science training tailored to the needs of the HIV response to
adolescents (Capacity Supporting Core); 2) Provide advanced methods and modeling expertise to combine
diverse insights from the individual PATC3H-IN Clinical Research Centers (CRCs) together (Advanced
Methods and Modeling Core); 3) Develop a shared strategy for community engagement and disseminating
insights from PATC3H-IN to key communities of interest (Community Engagement and Dissemination Core);
and 4) Evaluate INSPIRE progress and iteratively adapt, improve, and contribute to the network and science
(Administration and Evaluation Unit). By creating a centralized mechanism to harness strength, listen, and
convene across the networks, the INSPIRE Center will provide training, advanced methods, and engagement
functions that will augment the findings of each CRC individual study across the HIV prevention and treatment
care continuums, thus reducing inequities for AYA populations in LMIC settings and optimizing the translation
of research findings into real-world impact."
10995949,"Community Engagement and Dissemination Core Abstract
The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC) plays a pivotal role in the PATC3H-IN network
by emphasizing community engagement and research dissemination as essential components of its mission.
This core defines community engagement as a dynamic, two-way exchange between researchers and various
key communities of interest within the six PATC3H-IN countries, encompassing adolescents and young adults
(AYA) living with or at risk for HIV, AYA researchers, family members (especially guardians) and friends of
AYA, HIV care providers, implementers, community members, and policy-makers. Building on a strong
commitment to enhancing the dissemination of AYA HIV research in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), the CEDC has a track record of successful participatory crowdsourcing activities aimed at promoting
AYA inclusion in HIV research. These initiatives involve collaborative problem-solving and sharing solutions
with the community, demonstrating the capacity to effectively engage AYA and disseminate research findings
through creative means such as infographics and short videos. The CEDC's overarching goal is to disseminate
evidence-based HIV interventions, research findings, guidelines, and programs to combat the HIV epidemic
among AYA using community-engaged participatory strategies. To achieve this, they propose three specific
aims. Aim 1 focuses on community engagement in network leadership. The CEDC plans to determine
engagement and dissemination plans for the PATC3H-IN network through crowdsourcing and a modified
Delphi method. The results of this process will lead to the development of a consensus statement on
engagement and dissemination strategies, with a focus on adaptability, scale-up, and sustainability. Aim 2
centers on outreach and training for communities. The CEDC aims to create a network-wide platform for
training communities, including PATC3H-IN researchers and AYA, in engagement and dissemination
strategies. This involves the development of tailored training modules, a practical guide, videos, support for
social media, and a consultation service. The training will leverage existing strengths within the network using
appreciative inquiry. Aim 3 involves the translation of science to service. The CEDC will evaluate community
engagement and dissemination strategies, tracking metrics and monitoring dissemination. Case studies will be
guided by the Translational Science Benefits Model, and a dissemination summit will provide a platform to
celebrate successes. The CEDC will establish the infrastructure needed to develop and maintain community-
driven engagement and dissemination plans for the PATC3H-IN network, enhancing the capacities of network
researchers to meet the needs of local communities for outreach and dissemination. The CEDC will contribute
unique value to community engagement and dissemination, ultimately helping to address the HIV epidemic
among AYA in LMICs."
10980931,"SUMMARY. From initially cataloging the microbiome, we can now causally link specific strains and metabolites
of the microbiome with protective and pathogenic roles in a broad range of human disease. We are now faced
with the challenge of shaping beneficial microbiomes, such as at the strain-level, and enhancing microbiome
function, such as levels of microbiome-derived factors critical to the host, in order to harness the potential of the
microbiome for human health. The Bacteroides are the most abundant Gram-negative bacteria of the human gut
and play central roles in health and disease at the genus-, species- and strain- level, such as the role of pro-
carcinogenic B. fragilis EBTF+ strains in colon cancer. This motivates the need of both a comprehensive
understanding of the ecological factors impacting the Bacteroides and interventions to shape pro-health
Bacteroides communities. The Bacteroides survive by utilizing glycans, the basis for using ‘prebiotic’ dietary
glycans to target specific beneficial gut microbes such as members of the Bacteroides. Here, we reveal that
butyrate, abundant in the gut and critical to host physiology, demonstrates strain-specific inhibition against the
Bacteroides. Remarkably, butyrate inhibition is glycan dependent. Depending on the specific glycan used, a
strain is rendered differentially vulnerable to butyrate. Within a Bacteroides species, the same glycan can render
one strain vulnerable to butyrate and the other protected, suggesting that specific glycan-butyrate combinations
may be exploited to enhance or suppress specific Bacteroides strains. Defense from butyrate is mediated by the
activity of Acyl-CoA metabolic genes which differ among the Bacteroides. Unexpectedly, we find that extracellular
butyrate is taken up and metabolized by members of the Bacteroides, demonstrating the Bacteroides as one of
the first gut bacteria to take up butyrate and act as a potential microbial butyrate ‘sink’. Our findings revealing
the impact of butyrate on the glycan-dependent and strain-specific survival of the Bacteroides and the ability of
the Bacteroides to take-up and metabolize butyrate drive our central hypotheses: butyrate impacts the
Bacteroides in vivo, we can leverage dietary glycan-butyrate interactions to shape strain-specific Bacteroides
communities, and the Bacteroides modulate butyrate levels in the gut. To test these, we propose to:
Aim 1. Define the impact of butyrate on the composition of the Bacteroides in vivo
Aim 2. Determine the role of the Bacteroides in butyrate homeostasis in the gut
 Successful completion of this proposal will establish a new function for butyrate in gut microbial ecology, develop
needed interventions to enhance/suppress Bacteroides strains by exploiting glycan-butyrate interactions, and
establish both the role of microbial ‘sinks’ in gut butyrate homeostasis and the Bacteroides as a target to optimize
butyrate levels in vivo. Our work is poised to have broad impact for our understanding of microbial ecology, diet-
microbe-host interactions, microbial metabolism, and colonic health, with potential wide-ranging translational
applications to shape Bacteroides communities and optimize butyrate levels in heath and disease."
10980932,"Summary
The thymus plays a critical role in preventing autoimmunity by deleting or inducing a Treg cell
fate in thymocytes that react to self-antigens present in the thymus. But it is unclear how the
thymus achieves tolerance to transiently expressed self-antigens, like those expressed in
induced immune states such as inflammation, wound repair, and germinal center reactions. We
have recently discovered that the thymus constitutively produces type I and III interferons and
class switched activated B cells, beginning quite early in life. Our published and preliminary data
show that these cytokines activate antigen presenting cells in the thymus environment and
cause reproducible changes in the T cell repertoire selected, particularly the Treg cell repertoire.
Thus, we seek to test the hypothesis that T cells need to be highly tolerant of induced immune
states (inflammation, germinal centers) in order to function in those states without inducing
autoimmune pathology.
The proposed research will: 1) Test if thymic IFN provides T cell tolerance to interferon
stimulated self-antigens, 2) Determine why IFNI/III deficient mice have a major thymic selection
defect, and 3) Test if IFNIII-licensed B cells select Treg cells that regulate humoral immune
responses.
These aims will provide a mechanistic understanding of the source and consequences of innate
immune activation in the thymus. Understanding T cell tolerance to self-antigens in immune
activated states is important because many human autoimmune diseases are associated with
or follow infections."
10981679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acoustic communication is critical for normal social interactions in many species, including humans, yet our
knowledge of how the auditory system functions in more naturalistic social communication settings is limited. In
particular, we need a more detailed understanding for how the vocabulary of sounds that carry socially commu-
nicative meaning (e.g. speech sounds for humans) becomes established and grows through experience. Hu-
mans are especially good at learning a diversity of sounds that convey similar meanings – a prerequisite for rich
semantic categories in languages – but how and where the brain learns to fuse new spectrotemporal signals
with behaviorally synonymous ones into one “schema” is rarely investigated at the cellular, circuit or network
level. There is thus a gap in knowledge about detailed mechanisms supporting learning the social meaning of
new communication sounds. The basic associative processes that must link distinct stimuli to the same pheno-
typic behavior also exist in experimentally accessible mammals like mice, for whom such learning can also have
adaptive value, especially for hearing these socially important sounds in complex soundscapes where there can
be noise or distractors (e.g. cocktail party). Our long-term goal is to understand the cellular, circuit and network
mechanisms by which mammalian auditory systems encode and learn sounds that mediate acoustic communi-
cation and hears them in complex soundscapes, so that causes underlying deficits in communication processing
and learning can be inferred. Our objective here is to uncover how specific forms of noncanonical auditory cortical
plasticity (observed as adult female mice learn the communicative significance of sounds predictive of pups
requiring care) impact detection, discrimination and grouping of these sounds both behaviorally and neurally
within the auditory cortical core and secondary fields. We will use a combination of naturalistic behavior and
operant conditioning, electrophysiology in head-fixed and freely moving mice, and cell type-specific targeting for
optogenetics to pursue three Aims. First, we will determine what impact learning a new communicative sound
stream has on its auditory cortical detectability in a complex soundscape. Second, we will determine how auditory
cortex is altered while learning in a complex soundscape to discriminate or group new sound streams that com-
municate a social behavioral function. Third, we will determine the contribution of specific responses and ACx
circuits in causally mediating recognition of a new communicative sound stream in a complex soundscape and
the associated ACx plasticity. This research’s significance lies in its unique ability to bridge the scientific gap
between sensory and social neuroscience for learning communicative sounds, in an animal model where studies
of a high-level auditory function (communication) can be conducted from a systems down to a molecular level."

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is characterized by vasoocclusion of blood vessels and chronic hemolytic anemia,
resulting in recurrent and episodic acute organ damage. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a leading cause of
hospitalization, requires intensive care, and is the most common cause of death in SCD. Despite this, ACS
continues to be managed only with supportive interventions, such as oxygen therapy, antibiotics, and red blood
cell transfusions that likely fail to directly treat the underlying pathophysiology of this condition. Thus, there is an
unmet need for better therapeutic interventions in ACS. Our long-term research objective is to define key
molecular factors that drive ACS pathogenesis and use this information to identify targets to prevent or treat this
condition. We initially demonstrated that patients with ACS exhibit increased levels of complement activation,
including alternative complement pathway (ACP) specific products. Furthermore, in select patients, complement
inhibition appears to reverse hemolysis and result in rapid clinical improvement. Our overarching hypothesis is
that hemolysis-induced activation of the ACP amplifies hemolysis, injures endothelial cells, and activates
neutrophils, thereby resulting in ACS in SCD. The key contribution of this proposal will be characterizing the role
of ACP in hemolysis and ACS in pre-clinical models. To accomplish this, we will define the mechanisms by which
complement contributes to the development of ACS (aim 1) by evaluating the influence and interaction of
complement with erythrocytes and endothelium using a complementary approach of novel pre-clinical animal
models, microfluidics, and in vitro assays to measure complement dysregulation. To accomplish this, we
generated a novel humanized sickle mouse model that is deficient in complement component C3 (SSC3KO),
which is protected from hemin-mediated ACS. In addition to this novel genetic model and microfluidics, we will
utilize high-dimensional flow cytometry to characterize the complement and neutrophil-dependent mechanisms
contributing to ACS (aim 2). Finally, we will test the efficacy of pharmacological inhibitors to inhibit complement
pathways to prevent or treat ACS (aim 3), by targeting the alternative (factor B) and terminal (C5) pathways to
prevent hemolysis, neutrophil activation, endothelial injury, and subsequent ACS. The contribution of this overall
proposal is expected to be significant because it will allow us to develop tools that can help predict the likelihood
of ACS and also potentially identify critical therapeutic targets designed to prevent or abort ACS. We anticipate
that the successful completion of these studies will define an essential contribution of complement activation to
the development of ACS and, more importantly, could lead to a paradigm shift in the mechanistic understanding
of hemolysis and complement in the pathophysiology of SCD."
10981086,"PROJECT SUMMARY RESEARCH PROJECT There is an urgent need to develop scientific evidence in
support of effective strategies that will reduce climate impacts on vulnerable urban populations. This research
project of the UIC Center for Climate and Health Equity (CECHE) is a direct response to community-partner
concerns regarding the need for action-oriented solutions to address climate change impacts in Chicago’s
overburdened environmental justice (EJ) communities. While there is a great deal of research on green space
broadly defined, detailed assessments of specific green infrastructure (GI) features (tree canopy, biodiversity,
grass, non-native plantings) are often lacking. Consequently, there is limited epidemiologic evidence examining
detailed elements of GI and their variable influence on climate and health parameters including temperature,
air pollution, and flooding. Analogous to this, there is a need to identify how GI can alleviate cardiovascular and
respiratory responses in relationship with other climate related factors including heat and air pollution.
Industrialization, transportation, and structural racism have shaped the quality of the built environment and led
to a greater proportion of minority communities living in EJ communities throughout Chicago with significant
health disparities. Further, our research has found disparities in GI. In-depth assessments of potential causal
pathways linking climate and health outcomes have accounted for GI and environmental exposures are
needed. The Greater Chicago Region is an ideal study location. In 1995, the City of Chicago was the site of the
worst heat wave disaster in recent US history. More recently, Chicago received over nine inches of rain in less
than 24 hours, with greater impact in EJ communities. Despite recent gains, fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
levels have started to increase in recent years, and ground-level ozone (O3) levels are projected to rapidly
increase again. These concerning trends are compounded by Chicago’s aging and inadequate infrastructure.
Over the past 20 years, the many agencies in Chicago have made concerted efforts to promote GI without a
strong evidence base. To address these policy-relevant gaps, we will use a highly resolved spatiotemporal
data architecture linking multiple fine-scaled (~30 meter or ~1ft scale) GI, climate related environmental
hazards (PM2.5, O3, heat, flooding), and patient-level hospital admissions and emergency department visit data
from 2010–2023. We hypothesize that the specific quantity and type of GI is associated with reductions in the
risk of heat, air pollution, and flooding and may alter the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases
outcomes. We will determine associations of fine-scaled urban GI with high temperatures, PM2.5, and O3 (Aim
1), examine associations between GI and spatiotemporal incidence of flooding (Aim 2), and evaluate
association of short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, O3, heat, and flooding with emergency department visits
and hospitalizations and identify whether these associations are modified or mediated across different types of
GI (Aim 3). Outcomes will provide foundational evidence for policy, and lead to new translational research."
10981087,"PROJECT SUMMARY COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT CORE There is an urgent need for
community-driven, environmental justice (EJ) research with authentic community engagement to drive
innovative climate health equity research and to develop effective strategies to protect urban populations in
Chicago and beyond. The community outreach and engagement core (COEC) within the UIC Center for
Climate Health Equity will facilitate multi-directional communication between EJ communities, health care,
policy makers and researchers, and will build capacity for long-term and sustainable community driven climate
health solutions (Aim 1). This will be accomplished by establishing a community advisory group, embedding
community leadership across CECHE, and hosting regional summits so that target audience perspectives are
integrated and drive priority research and other dissemination activities across the entire center. This work will
also support opportunities to translate and disseminate research results into meaningful climate change and
health knowledge and solutions. We will establish a Climate Health Institute using a train-the-trainer mode (Aim
2) to expand knowledge and understanding regarding climate and health impacts among community
stakeholders and advance citizen scientists in climate research; and build capacity for community
organizations to advance climate and health solutions at the neighborhood level. We will also support
solutions-driven green infrastructure and advance stakeholder-driven comprehensive urban planning and
policy solutions for advancing climate health equity (Aim 3). This will be accomplished by conducting formative
qualitative research to understand community voices and concerns regarding the impact and value of nature-
based resiliency solutions and concerns regarding zoning and regional planning. Beyond this micro-scale
neighborhood-level work, we will create an inventory of current zoning and planning efforts in Chicago and the
300 largest U.S. municipalities to identify possible nature-based policy solutions for climate and health,
examining how policy approaches vary by community characteristics, and assessing the relationship between
the policies and selected health outcomes in the 300 municipalities. The result of this work will allow the COEC
to work with the Geospatial and Data Analysis Core and use research project results to introduce new tools to
transform current policies into more effective climate solutions; and use vulnerability indices and nature-based
explore tools to create alternative indicators of climate vulnerability in Chicago. This innovative work will ensure
all center activities and research are guided by community and stakeholder priorities. These novel approaches
will also serve as a model for community-engaged urban climate change research across the United States
and globally. Finally, the COEC will fill a critical chasm between climate, health sciences, and urban planning
research and bring diverse perspectives together to ensure that future research and strategies are grounded in
real-world experiences of vulnerable urban communities throughout Chicago and beyond."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem adversely impacting the physical and mental
health of victims and their children. It remains the most common form of violence experienced by women, with
>30% of women in the U.S. experiencing physical or sexual IPV over their lifetime. An important risk factor
associated with IPV perpetration is substance abuse, which can trigger aggressive behavior and worsen impulse
control problems. As use and misuse of both prescription (Rx) and non-Rx opioids have risen over the past two
decades, this has engendered a public health crisis with far-reaching consequences for individuals, families and
communities. One notable concern voiced by public health experts relates to the intersection of these two public
health crises, and the role played by opioid misuse in facilitating IPV. Among men using opioids, prevalence of
IPV perpetration ranged from 15% (past-year severe/physical IPV) to 58% (lifetime prevalence). Opioid use is
also a risk factor for being a victim of IPV, with 32-75% of women opioid users reporting past year victimization.
Beyond correlational evidence on the co-occurrence of opioid use and IPV, the consequences of the opioid crisis
for IPV have not been systematically explored. There is no causal evidence to date on the intersection of these
two public health crises, and no studies on how interventions targeting opioid misuse are impacting IPV
perpetration and victimization. Our project is significant in providing the first analyses of downstream effects –
positive or negative – of two supply-side interventions targeting the opioid epidemic on the risk of IPV perpetration
and victimization: (i) prescription drug monitoring programs, designed to collect and monitor Rx opioid data for
preventing its misuse and diversion into non-medical uses, and (ii) the reformulation of OxyContin – one of the
most popular Rx opioids for recreational use and abuse – into an abuse-deterrent form in 2010. We will leverage
5 survey and administrative data sources, spanning up to 3 decades, with complementary strengths including
the 1) National Crime Victimization Survey; 2) National Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Survey;
3) National Incident Based Reporting System; 4) FBI Supplemental Homicide Reports; and 5) National
Epidemiologic Surveys on Alcohol and Related Conditions. These data sets are nationally-representative, have
large sample sizes, and capture IPV across the spectrum of severity, including homicides committed by an
intimate partner, and reporting status (self-reported, reported to law enforcement). Exploring heterogeneity in
these responses by perpetrator/victim characteristics and by access to substance use treatment services will
also allow us to identify vulnerable populations and propose public health policies to address potentially
unintended consequences of policies targeting the opioid crisis. Our project is innovative by using cutting-edge
quasi-experimental methods, including newer “difference-in-differences” methods designed to reduce bias in
estimated treatment effects due to dynamic heterogeneity, to explore dynamic responses in how opioid policies
have impacted the risk of IPV perpetration/victimization."

RESEARCH: Natural Killer (NK) cells are crucial for the immediate defense against virus infections. To exert
their function, NK cells need to receive signals through activating receptors and cytokines. Cytokines
mediate their function via STAT transcription factors. We could previously show that STAT1, STAT2, STAT4
and STAT5 are all required for NK cell expansion in murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Studying the
role of STAT3 in NK cells, I found that STAT3 plays a context-dependent role. In regular-dose infection,
STAT3 augmented proliferation of NK cells. However, in high-dose infection STAT3 appeared to impair NK
cell expansion. This suggests that our model can be used to study the context-dependent role of STAT3,
which has broad relevance for the fields of immunology and cancer biology. In this proposal, I seek to answer
1) how are different upstream signals altering the role of STAT3 for NK cell function and 2) how are identified
downstream targets of STAT3 contributing to the context-specific role of STAT3.
CANDIDATE: I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Dr. Joseph Sun at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC). Prior to this position, I studied the differentiation of CD8+ T cells and NK cells. My interest
is the mechanistic study of immune cell differentiation and function during viral infection. I joined the Sun
lab as one of the leading groups studying the molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell function. Through
the work outlined in this proposal I will 1) acquire technical expertise available in my current lab with a focus
on the study of transcription factors, 2) develop a network of scientists that enable the collaborative type of
research I seek to participate in and 3) develop skills necessary for career development such as mentoring,
data presentation and grantsmanship skills. I have assembled an excellent Advisory Committee that is
committed and capable to guide me on my path to independence: Dr. Rudensky for technical support, Dr.
Leslie for mentorship in computational biology and Dr. Ivashkiv as an expert in cytokine and STAT biology.
With the support of my mentor and Advisory Committee I will be able to acquire the necessary knowledge
and expertise during the K99 phase to launch my own independent career.
ENVIRONMENT: The Immunology Program at MSKCC is part of the Tri-Institutional network composed of
MSKCC, Rockefeller University and Weill Cornell University. The highly collaborative culture promotes
scientific exchange and has provided me with crucial technological support. Furthermore, I could begin to
form a network with multiple groups at our campus. Regular presentations by renowned senior scientists
enable me to expand the scope of my scientific questions. Weekly lab meetings and frequent personal
meetings with my mentor Joseph Sun, who has successfully guided multiple former trainees in launching
their own academic career, make my environment ideal for starting my path to independence."

Immunosuppressive and homeostatic mechanisms prevent immune cells and tissues from eliminating solid
tumors, limiting the efficacy of anti-tumor immunity. Precise dissection of these homeostatic mechanisms can
lead to better understanding of how tumors persist and grow within tissues. Our prior studies demonstrate that
the A20 protein is a potent regulator of immune homeostasis, regulating both pro-inflammatory and cell death
signals. Our recent preliminary data reveal that A20 is highly expressed in tumor microenvironments and that
one specific biochemical motif of this protein restrains both acute and anamnestic antitumor immunity. This
proposal will dissect the cellular and molecular pathways by which A20 regulates anti-tumor immunity."

The public health and economic impact of chronic sleep deprivation (SD) have grown
enormously with the increasingly global and 24-hour nature of our society. The human costs are
also high; SD is an exacerbating factor in many mental illnesses. In spite of this, however, we
know very little about the mechanisms by which SD alters memory circuits.
Memory formation is bidirectionally sensitive to sleep levels. SD has negative effects on its
formation, while learning has been shown to enhance sleep drive, suggesting that there are
circuit interactions binding memory and sleep centers. In Drosophila, we have a very detailed
understanding both of the computations that underlie memory formation and the structure of
sleep circuits. This proposal leverages this knowledge to understand, for the first time at a circuit
and molecular level, how SD dysregulates both short-term and long-term memory formation.
 In Aim 1 we investigate the effects of sleep deprivation on short-term memory formation.
Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that SD-dependent changes in dopamine dynamics
degrade coincidence detection. We test specific circuit and molecular mechanisms and propose
strategies to ameliorate SD pathology.
 In Aim 2 we probe the effect of SD on protein synthesis-dependent long-term memory.
Preliminary data demonstrate that pre-training SD blocks activity-dependent local protein
synthesis and that local synthesis is sensitive to inhibition of MAPK pathways. We will uncover
the molecular mechanisms of how spaced training promotes this critical step in initiation of
stable memory formation and we will determine how SD disrupts the process.
Looking at SD through a lens of plasticity dysfunction will provide a strong molecular
understanding of how memory formation is adversely affected by lack of sleep. Importantly,
these studies also will deepen our knowledge of how memory is formed in well-rested brains
and give us insight into what parts of the process are vulnerable to disruption, making this work
relevant to understanding a wide range of other pathologies."
10990711,"ABSTRACT
 In the past funding period we focused on hyperexcitability, because several studies in rodents and
humans suggested it played an important role in AD pathophysiology. We showed for the first time that there is
a type of epileptiform activity that occurs extremely early and is common in diverse mouse models of AD. The
epileptiform activity was a very large but brief spike in the EEG. This was surprising because many research
studies have focused on seizures. However, IIS in mouse models of AD were far more common and occurred
at younger ages than seizures, suggesting IIS deserved more attention. Indeed, it is debated how common
seizures are in human AD, and many clinical studies have reported IIS. In this proposal we focus on IIS for
these reasons. We ask several fundamental questions: where in the brain do IIS originate, and does that they
change with age? If IIS are selectively inhibited is cognition improved? Given hyperexcitability leads to
increased extracellular Aβ, if we inhibit IIS is Aβ reduced? What are the mechanisms underlying IIS?
 In Aim 1 we will address the hypothesis that IIS begin in the dentate gyrus (DG) based on data showing
that the DG recording of the IIS is earlier and larger than area CA1 and overlying cortex. We will also ask if
other brain areas generate IIS as mice age and pathology progressively worsens. In Aim 2 we will use closed-
loop optogenetics to silence the principal cells of the DG, granule cells (GCs) and do so only during IIS to ask if
this selective, transient GC silencing improves memory and pathology. We will first target all GCs and then the
subset of adult-born GCs, because the young GCs may make a unique contribution to IIS. Aim 3 addresses
mechanisms of IIS. We hypothesize that acetylcholine (ACh) is key because IIS primarily occur in rapid-eye
movement (REM) sleep, a time when cholinergic input to the forebrain rises. Also, medial septum (MS)
cholinergic neurons appear to be overly active in sleep in mice that simulate AD. In early AD, an enzyme
critical for ACh synthesis is elevated, which we also found in an AD mouse model. Another clue is that, in
epilepsy, IIS are caused by a paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS), which is a large, sudden depolarization of
principal cells that lead to a burst of action potentials. Therefore, we hypothesize that IIS in AD reflect a PDS,
and this is due to actions of MS cholinergic neurons in REM sleep. Pilot data support the hypothesis because
the muscarinic agonist carbachol induces a PDS-like event in GCs. A concurrent depolarization is also
required, which appears to be due to a carbachol-dependent inward current and the glutamatergic input from
DG mossy cells (MCs) which we found are hyperexcitable in transgenic mice. Both the inward current and MC
excitation of GCs appear to be greater in a mouse model of AD than wild type mice. If we are correct, selective
optogenetic inhibition of cholinergic input or MC input would prevent the GC PDS and IIS, and pilot data
suggest this is indeed the case.
 Together the experiments will address reasons for early hyperexcitability in AD, a topic that has attracted
widespread attention in the AD research community. The proposal will also address mechanisms and therefore
potential future therapeutic strategies."

Proposed Research Plan. Latinas are less likely to receive timely diagnostic care and are more likely to
experience greater psychosocial distress following screening mammograms, relative to non-Latino Whites
(NLW). Disparities in diagnostic resolution contribute to worse cancer outcomes (e.g., late stage cancer, worse
post-diagnosis quality of life). Past research has highlighted a major, modifiable, determinant of disparities –
social isolation. Latinas with abnormal mammogram results are less likely to engage their tight-knit family and
community networks. In part, this is due to limited community knowledge of diagnostic processes, which
contribute to greater cancer fatalism and stigma. Existing interventions (e.g., navigation) focus on clinical
barriers to diagnostic follow-up, but do not address the importance of social support access. The proposed
work will address these knowledge gaps. Ms. Martinez and her team will conduct a qualitative, semi-structured,
study with 25 Latinas who have received abnormal results through the parent project. Aim 1 is to identify
strategies that would enable Latinas' disclosure and access to social support, following an abnormal result.
Aim 2 is to identify barriers and facilitators for Latinas' promotion of diagnostic processes with communities.
These findings will inform health communications interventions that enable Latinas to (1) access social support
and (2) contribute to a supportive community environment for other Latinas who face diagnostic evaluation,
after a screening mammogram. This ancillary project will add to the parent study, which focuses on screening
mammography, through expansion to understanding social networks in the context of diagnostic follow-up.
Candidate. Ms. Martinez is a driven Latina graduate school trainee, as a BRCA carrier and family member of
multiple Latinas diagnosed with breast cancer. Her major goals are to develop interventions that can maximize
mental health among Latinas and other marginalized communities undergoing cancer-related diagnostic,
treatment, and survivorship care. Toward that goal, she is pursuing a Masters of Social Work degree in mental
health and recently served Community Engagement Core Manager for a research center focused on cancer
equity. This work equipped her with skills in community engaged research and clinical training in mental health.
However, she has major training gaps in health communications, qualitative research, and manuscript
development.
Career Development and Mentorship Plan. Ms. Martinez aims to become a highly impactful cancer equity
researcher at a research-intensive institution. Her training plan consists of didactic training (coursework,
seminars), workshops, participation in scientific conferences, manuscript / pilot grant preparation, and
personalized mentorship from a team that are experts in breast cancer equity, cancer-related mental well-
being, qualitative methods, community engagement, and health communications."
11000451,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a complex and heterogenous disorder characterized by multiple clinical,
neuropathological and molecular phenotypes. Despite considerable effort to date, there is currently a lack of
interventions or cure, thus there is a clear need for a better understanding of the heterogenous disease
phenotypes and the underlying genetics to identify more effective preclinical strategies. Rapidly expanding
genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and epigenomic data sets, and emerging animal models of AD
created by the Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (MODEL-AD)
consortium, now provide new tools for accelerating our understanding of AD and enable interspecies analysis
for mapping findings from mouse model systems of AD to human omics signatures. While multi-omics data sets
derived from AD and animal models of AD are available to the scientific community through various data
ecosystems including the AD Knowledge Portal, a NIA designated FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable) data repository, a current barrier is mapping disease relevant molecular signatures between
model organisms and humans. Thus, there is an emerging need to provide training in bioinformatics
methodologies for systematic interspecies translation of omics-derived signatures of AD. To address this need,
we aim to provide a new, and increasingly diverse, generation of researchers, with awareness of available
resources and to provide skills development for integrating multi-scale data from model systems and humans to
advance AD research and interventions. We propose a unique, annual, 4-day workshop at The Jackson
Laboratory (JAX), that will leverage trainers and expertise from Sage Bionetwork, the host institution for The AD
Knowledge Portal and Exceptional Longevity Data Management and Coordinating Center, and the MODEL-AD
Center at JAX. The proposed workshop, Computational Techniques and Resources for Effective Translational
Research in Alzheimer’s Disease, will focus on enabling utilization of omics-driven computational techniques
and analytical principles for cross species functional alignment. Active learning programming sessions will be
the core of the workshop, in combination with lectures and interactive forums. Participants will emerge from the
workshop equipped with the knowledge and technical skills to conduct rigorous and reproducible computational
research for more effective translational strategies in AD. To achieve this, we propose the following aims: 1)
foster utilization of existing data resources from human and model organism studies in AD; 2) deliver hands-on
training on computational techniques that reinforce rigor and reproducibility principles for translational AD
research, and; 3) create an inclusive environment for trainees that fosters networking, collaboration, and
experiential learning. Pro-active strategies, including provision of scholarships, will be employed to recruit
participants from historically minoritized and disadvantaged backgrounds to gain their input, provide equitable
educational opportunities, and to enhance future representation in the AD field."
11000597,"The Specific Aims of the 2024 Neurobiology of the Brain Disorders Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) are to promote dialogue among established and emerging leaders in neurodegenerative disease. The Co-Chairs, Drs. Karen Duff and Chris Shaw, in consultation with past chairs, and the 2026 Vice Chairs (Drs. Hemali Phatnani and Michael Ward) have planned nine oral sessions that will focus on the current and future landscape of research for the major neurodegenerative diseases, including how genetics is informing on disease mechanisms, how genomics approaches (including bioinformatics) are being used to add more mechanistic insight into genetic findings, how biomarkers are being used to understand mechanisms, diagnose and monitor disease and the status of therapeutics, for diseases, including some new therapeutic approaches that are being developed and applied to address unmet needs. In addition to these sessions there be focused sessions discussing the current understanding of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), FTD (including tau and TDP related dementias), PD (including LBD) and ALS, as well as aging and how it impacts these diseases. The GRC will be preceded by a GRS to facilitate the presentation and discussion of frontier research by trainees. As the Chairs and Co-Chairs place the highest priority on participation by trainees and early-career individuals, short talks will be selected from submitted abstracts to complement invited speakers. We will make every effort to increase the participation of under-represented minorities among conference participants and speakers. Conference participants will interact informally in a collegial atmosphere and have ample free time, providing ideal settings for participants to brainstorm and establish interdisciplinary collaborations. The significance of this GRC is to provide a unique forum for the international community working on the neurobiology of brain disorders, especially AD/ADRD, to discuss the latest advances and the future challenges in the field of neurodegeneration and aging-related brain disorders. The relevance of this application to public health is that the discussions will define the most important questions for AD/ADRD, FTD, PD and ALS, spanning basic biology and disease mechanisms and aid the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The long-term goal of this GRC is to provide a consistent platform for this community to meet every two years to disseminate the most recent discoveries and formulate the most important questions concerning the current state-of-the-art research on age-related neurodegenerative diseases."

The goal of this application is to support additional efforts to enhance the diversity, equity, and inclusion of
participants for the Unite 2 Fight Paralysis (U2FP) Annual Science and Advocacy Symposium, to be held in
Atlanta, GA in October of 2024. The overarching goal of the Symposium is to accelerate the development,
translation, and implementation of novel treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI). The Symposium aims to build
essential collaborations that are crucial for driving the SCI field forward and towards meaningful change. SCI
presents a significant public health challenge, with life-altering consequences and limited therapeutic
interventions. The Symposium addresses this challenge by bringing together diverse stakeholders to confront
the complexities of SCI research and treatment development. Recognizing the underrepresentation of certain
groups, the application outlines strategic aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion. These include
providing travel awards for trainees from underrepresented groups and conducting outreach activities to invite
individuals from diverse backgrounds, underrepresented groups, and women. To enrich the symposium
experience, innovative approaches are proposed. Discussion sessions led by persons with lived-experience in
SCI (SCI PLEX), coupled with a pre-Symposium workshop on ways to enhance equitable scientific
communications between diverse stakeholders, aim to deepen understanding and address challenges in
delivering restorative treatments for paralysis. The Symposium plans to exclusively feature trainee
presentations in poster and short communication sessions, paired with SCI lived-experience consultants for
guidance on audience engagement. In summary, the U2FP Symposium plans to create a dynamic and
inclusive space for stakeholders, advancing SCI research through collaboration, diverse perspectives, and
improved scientific communication. With aims to enhance diversity and empower participants, the Symposium
stands as a pivotal event in the pursuit of effective treatments and cures for spinal cord injury."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the top causes of death and disability worldwide. However, due to its complexity, it remains one of the most challenging neurological conditions to treat. Advances in our understanding of TBI pathobiology and improvements in clinical care for TBI require multidisciplinary exchange of scientific ideas and encouragement of promising young investigators in the field. Our first Western Neurotrauma Symposium (WNTS) was well received and especially noted for the attention given to the trainees and early investigators and the collaborative environment. The WNTS will continue to be a unique regional conference providing an annual venue for a broad range of neurotraumatology research, with a focus on trainees and early career investigators, presentation of cutting-edge data in a safe environment, multidisciplinary collaborative ideas and a more intimate setting to allow direct interactions between attendees. This meeting will be instrumental in developing the next generation of investigators and ideas, without duplicating or replacing opportunities provided at existing National and International Neurotrauma Symposia. While the focus of continued WNTS funding would be development of regional young investigators and collaborators, attendance at the meeting would be open. The first WNTS showed participation of a more diverse population from centers throughout the Western U.S. with specific outreach and travel awards to encourage active participation of underrepresented groups in neuroscience/neurotrauma research. In 2022, the R13 supported 17 young investigators and trainees, and faculty. In 2023 19 were supported, enhancing diversity at all levels. The additional support provided by renewing this grant for 2024 would specifically enable expanded inclusion of investigators from outside of the UC, bringing in research and clinical trainees and faculty from across the western states, for whom travel, expense and time constraints may limit opportunities for young persons to attend national or international conferences."

Same as parent award 5K23NS116128.
Status epilepticus affects approximately 160,000 people in the U.S. each year and carries substantial
associated morbidity and mortality. Use of prehospital benzodiazepines by EMS providers varies widely,
resulting in failures to provide evidence-based care to a large proportion of patients. Despite the striking
underuse of prehospital benzodiazepines for status epilepticus, the causes and the clinical consequence have
not been fully delineated. Prehospital providers may hesitate to administer benzodiazepines because the
respiratory risks of undertreated seizures may be perceived as less morbid than the respiratory depression
caused by medication-related oversedation. Alternatively, prehospital care may be driven by variable
emergency medical services treatment protocols that frequently define status epilepticus incorrectly and
instruct providers to give benzodiazepine doses lower than established guidelines. Accordingly, the overall
objective of this proposal is to discover the key factors that dictate prehospital status epilepticus management
and quantify the extent to which our current shortcomings are associated with worse outcomes. The advent of
more detailed EMS electronic medical records and linkage of these records to hospital data provide a new
opportunity to examine these questions with increased rigor. The results will be critical in addressing the
clinical concerns of front-line providers and improving outcomes among patients with status epilepticus through
the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Assess the association between undertreated status epilepticus and clinical outcomes.
Aim 2. Determine the association between prehospital benzodiazepine dose and EMS agency protocol
instructions for status epilepticus.
Aim 3. Identify barriers and facilitators to evidence-based benzodiazepine administration for patients with out-
of-hospital status epilepticus using qualitative methods.
Through the proposed research, relevant coursework, and a mentoring team with wide-ranging expertise, Dr.
Guterman will build necessary skills in study design and advanced biostatistical methods (Dr. Daniel
Lowenstein, the primary mentor, and Dr. John Neuhaus), implementation science (Dr. S. Andrew Josephson
and Dr. Sara Ackerman), and qualitative and mixed methods research (Dr. Sara Ackerman). The findings from
this project will address an understudied aspect of status epilepticus care and provide insight needed to
improve its prehospital treatment. The results will build the evidence base for a future R01 proposal to
prospectively evaluate prehospital treatment and outcomes in patients presenting with status epilepticus. This
project will also bring Dr. Guterman closer to her long-term goal of becoming a leading clinician-investigator
dedicated to advancing the treatment of status epilepticus and ensuring that real-world care for these patients
matches the best available evidence."

Tobacco addiction remains a leading cause of disease and death worldwide, and an increasing number of never-
smokers are being exposed to nicotine via e-cigarettes. However, the role of specific nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors (nAChR) in nicotine’s behavioral effects remains poorly understood because of the availability of very
few subtype-selective probes, which limit drug development potential. Thus, this proposal aims to develop novel
probes to better understand the function of the different α4β2 subtypes, which have been proposed to underlie
behaviors characteristic of nicotine dependence. The α4β2 nAChR subtypes exhibit two distinct isoforms: α42β23,
which has a high affinity for acetylcholine and nicotine, and α43β22 nAChR, which has a lower affinity for
acetylcholine and nicotine. Our recent findings have suggested that probes selectively targeting the high
sensitivity α42β23 nAChRs may provide a novel, previously undefined understanding of nicotine’s behavioral and
pharmacological actions. Thus, these studies will develop and optimize novel positive allosteric modulators
(PAMs) of the high sensitivity α42β23 nAChRs. Specific Aim 1 will begin by focusing on the synthesis of novel
analogs of desformylflustrabromine (dFBr) and GAT2802 to derive an improved pharmacological profile. Specific
Aim 2 will involve in vitro characterization of novel probes from both structural classes as α42β3 nAChR-selective
PAMs. Thereafter, Specific Aim 3 studies will evaluate ADME/PK profiling of key α42β23 PAMs to eliminate
potential liabilities and identify probes with suitable drug-like properties. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, the most
promising probes will be tested for their efficacy in inducing behaviors characteristic of nicotine’s 42 nAChR
actions in adult male and female mice. Taken together, these studies will develop and validate novel HS-selective
α42β23 PAM probes to better understand the pharmacological effects of α4β2 nAChRs in behaviors characteristic
of nicotine’s actions, which may thereby lead to future therapeutic implications."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, known for its
profound immune suppression and resistance to most therapies. One strategy to overcome these barriers is to
leverage the effects of standard-of-care chemotherapy to increase extracellular ATP and promote anti-tumor
inflammation. However, PDACs express high levels of ectonucleotidases ENPP1, CD39, and CD73 that
quickly convert extracellular ATP released by dying tumor cells to immunosuppressive adenosine. In a recent
Phase IA/1B clinical trial at UCLA for patients with Borderline Resectable PDAC (NCT03970252), neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy and PD-1 inhibition produced changes of a more permissive anti-tumor immune
microenvironment (TME) and was associated with excellent overall survival. However, compensatory
adenosine signaling increased in post-treatment tumors, potentially hindering anti-tumor immunity. To
strategically address this problem, a follow-up Phase 1/2 trial (NCT05688215) was initiated at UCLA in
collaboration with Arcus Biosciences that introduces a small molecule inhibitor of CD73 to neoadjuvant
FOLFIRINOX and PD-1 inhibition to limit adenosine in the PDAC TME. This proposal aims to extensively
evaluate pre- and post-treatment patient specimens from this trial to define the impact of CD73 inhibition on
tumor adenosine metabolism, signaling and -mediated immunosuppression (Aim 1). Predictors of response
and resistance to CD73 inhibition will be identified. In Aim 2, autochthonous tumor models, implantable models
of metastasis and human tumor explants will be used to define the roles of ENPP1 and CD39 as regulators of
ATP breakdown and whether they cooperate with CD73 to generate adenosine. In addition to ATP, the
ectonucleotidase ENPP1 degrades the natural STING ligand cGAMP, also released by tumor cells after DNA
damaging chemotherapy, to further reduce anti-tumor inflammation. Therefore, the proposed studies in Aim 3
will build on novel preliminary data showing that adenosine directly inhibits STING activation in myeloid cells
and will explore whether ENPP1 inhibition cooperates with CD73 inhibitor-mediated adenosine depletion to
enhance STING signaling in the TME. These experiments will draw on a newly developed anti-human ENPP1
antibody and ENPP1 humanized mouse model. A transdisciplinary team with expertise in PDAC biology, tumor
immunology, clinical trials, bioinformatics, biostatistics and mass spectrometry with a strong track record of
working together has been assembled to complete the proposed studies. This project not only will provide a
comprehensive understanding of ATP and adenosine metabolism in the PDAC TME but also identify the
immunologic consequences of these changes. Overall, it has the potential to advance treatment outcomes for
patients with this challenging cancer type by effectively reversing adenosine-mediated immunosuppression to
unleash the full potency of chemo-immunotherapy."

The anterior second heart ﬁeld (SHF) cells are a population of late differentiating cardiovascular
progenitor cells that contribute to myocardial cells, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in
the heart. It was not discovered until recently that these SHF progenitors can also contribute to
cardiac lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) as well as the lymphatics of the craniofacial area in
mice. Lymphatics play essential roles in regulating interstitial fluid homeostasis and immune cell
modulation. It is unclear whether lymphatic defects can cause congenital cardiac and craniofacial
malformations. Mutation in CHD7, a gene encoding Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein
7 that functions as an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler, cause craniofacial defects and
cardiovascular malformations. It has been reported that CHD7 plays a cell-autonomous role in
SHF progenitors to regulate downstream gene expression. Our preliminary data further
demonstrated that CHD7 is highly expressed in cardiac lymphatic progenitors and chd7 mutant
zebrafish show defects in lymphatics in the craniofacial areas, on the out flow tract and the heart
ventricle. We will test the hypothesis that CHD7 regulates gene expression and chromatin
accessibility in cardiac and craniofacial LECs derived from SHF progenitors. We propose two
independent aims to 1) perform confocal and live imaging and lineage tracing to analyze the chd7
mutant phenotypes and SHF contributions to craniofacial and cardiac LECs; 2) perform single
nuclei Multiomic amalysis, spatial transcriptomics and CUT&RUN to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which CHD7 regulates downstream gene expression and chromatin landscapes.
Our proposed experiments will reveal previously unappreciated roles of CHD7 in LECs derived
from SHF progenitors and help identify CHD7 downstream target genes that can be potential
therapeutic targets for patients with CHD and lymphatic malformations."

This proposal requests partial support for the FASEB Research Conference “Phospholipid Signaling in Aging
and Disease” to be held July 21-25, 2024, at the Intercontinental Hotel Saint Paul Riverfront Hotel in St. Paul,
Minnesota, USA. This conference, which began in 1988 and has been attended biennially by researchers from
across the world, is critical to the missions of the NIA because lipids are critical mediators of signaling, aging,
mitochondrial biology, metabolism, cancer and neurodegeneration. Although there are several conferences that
focus on lipid signaling and metabolism, the proposed 2024 FASEB Conference will have a focus on lipids and
aging, longevity, metabolism, and neurodegeneration. This conference will (1) bring together leading
investigators in lipid metabolism and signaling in aging, health and longevity, (2) help train the next generation
of US investigators to bring new advances to lipid and aging discovery sciences, and (3) promote the
improvement of human health by investigating lipid metabolism and signaling in aging and longevity.
The major goals of the 2024 FASEB Conference on “Phospholipid Signaling in Aging and Disease” are to: (1)
share the most current information on lipid metabolism and signaling in aging, (2) facilitate new interactions
among scientists who do not normally interact in research, (3) promote interdisciplinary interactions that will lead
to new collaborations, and (4) enable understanding and translational research leading to safe human
interventions to improve healthy aging and metabolism. We expect that the new insights that are formed during
the course of this meeting will advance the entire lipid field and especially advance research with a focus on lipids
in aging and neurodegeneration as well as longevity, metabolism, and mitochondrial biology. The objective of
this proposal is to obtain funds to support travel and conference fees for scientists, with a special emphasis on
junior faculty, trainees, and those that are underrepresented in science.
The organizing committee consists of four members (Drs. Burke, Emerling, Hirsch, and Tooze), who were
nominated by the 2022 FASEB Phospholipids: Dynamic Lipid Signaling in Health and Disease conference
organizers. Each organizer is an expert in one or more of the topics that will be covered during the course of the
meeting. Together, the interdisciplinary committee has a broad range of expertise in lipid research related to
lipids in aging and disease. The organizing committee has made calculated efforts to represent major areas of
lipid metabolism and signaling in aging, from metabolic regulation to specific areas of biology and disease.
Further, several workshops on lipids as well as mentoring sessions will be held, which we believe will provide 1)
training on lipids and lipid changes with aging, as well as 2) new opportunities for attendees to think about their
research and how it can crossover into the aging field."

Lung transplantation (LTx) is the only life-saving intervention for many patients with end-stage
lung disease. The long-term survival after LTx, however, is severely limited primarily due to
chronic rejection of the allograft (chronic lung allograft dysfunction - CLAD). Bronchiolitis
obliterans syndrome (BOS) is the most frequent phenotype of CLAD. It is characterized by partial
to complete obliteration and luminal occlusion of distal airways and includes features of
subepithelial cellular inflammation, peribronchial and interstitial fibrosis, and selective loss of club
cells within the airway epithelium. The pathogenesis of CLAD remains poorly understood, largely
due to a lack of clinically relevant animal models, but includes influx and activation of cell
populations of the innate and acquired immune system, tissue remodelling, and distorted immune-
epithelial cell crosstalk. However, which specific immune cell populations drive tissue remodelling
in the transplanted lung remains unknown. We have recently discovered a significant increase in
B cell populations and Marginal Zone B And B1 Cell Specific Protein (MZB) 1-positive plasma
cells in rejected lungs, both in lungs from a novel mouse model of chronic rejection after orthotopic
LTx, as well as in retransplanted CLAD patients. We showed that an innate-like B-1B population
served as a progenitor pool of MZB1+ plasma cells and that B cell deficiency prevented chronic
rejection in mice. Systemic depletion of B cells, however, is associated with increased risks of
concomitant infections, in particular in patients routinely receiving high doses of
immunosuppressive regimen, such as LTx patients, thus requiring more nuanced approaches to
modify this pathogenic B and plasma cell populations. Therefore, the overarching goal of this
application is to define the spatiotemporal profile and cellular heterogeneity of MZB1+ B and
plasma cell populations over time after LTx and interrogate their mechanistic contribution to
chronic rejection by manipulation their abundance and function in vivo. We hypothesize that
plasma cells accumulate in chronically rejected lungs in peribronchial regions and cause
increased peribronchial fibrosis and decreased lung function in chronic rejection. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: To provide a comprehensive and detailed map
of B and plasma cell gene expression profiles, population heterogeneity, and temporal dynamics
in the chronically rejected lung after LTx. Aim 2: To mechanistically interrogate whether deletion
of MZB1 or blocking the differentiation of MZB1+ plasma cells from B-1B cells prevents tissue
fibrosis, lung function deterioration, and chronic rejection after orthotopic LTx in mice."

Voice and upper airway (VUA) disorders affect nearly 30% of the general population and 80% of occupational
voice users in the United States. Patients experience symptoms of vocal fatigue, hoarse voice, chronic cough or
breathing difficulties, affecting their daily communication and swallowing functions. Many of these symptoms can
be modified behaviorally and with therapeutic exercises. An incalcitrant treatment challenge is to support
patient compliance and their carryover of behavioral changes outside the clinic. Wearable technology is widely
adopted to help track patient’s health conditions and promote adherence to treatment. Existing wearables for
VUA health monitoring are, however, wired, semi-rigid and single modal sensing at best.
In this project, we will leverage our expertise in wearable electronics, biomaterial engineering and computational
medicine to develop a new class of VUA health wearable system. In particular, the new wearable will be wireless
and conformable to the neck skin surface. A dual-modal sensing technology, which will be implemented for the
very first time in VUA wearables, will be developed with neck surface accelerometry (NSA) and surface
electromyography (sEMG). The combined use of NSA and sEMG will offer complementary physiological
measurements that will allow for monitoring VUA symptoms with better precision and broader utility. Three
specific aims (S.A.) are proposed in this project.
S.A. 1. We will develop a single neck-worn wearable device that is skin-conformable, wireless and dual-sensing.
A commercial NSA sensor, a multi-channel sEMG array and peripheral electronics will be assembled on a
flexible, stretchable substrate. Our team has developed dry, soft sEMG electrodes, which will be customized for
detecting perilaryngeal muscle activity. We will implement wireless power management and data transmission
protocols. We will further modify our biocompatible and reusable adhesives for long-term wearable mounting.
S.A. 2. We will evaluate the new wearable device on vocally healthy participants to optimize the configuration
and placement of NSA and sEMG sensors. We will also develop efficient machine learning models to classify
VUA symptoms in near real time. Results will help us refine the wearable system toward system miniaturization.
S.A. 3. We will develop a companion smartphone application (app) for user-device interaction and data
management. We will then evaluate the usability and utilization of the wearable system in patients with laryngeal
hyperfunction who will undergo a week of remote monitoring in a free-living setting. Lastly, we will use the
collected wearable data to build patient-specific algorithms for estimating clinical VUA symptom severity.
Outcomes from this study will allow for iterative product improvement and translation of this technology for clinical
use in a rational and accountable way. Ultimately, this wearable system will assist clinicians to remotely track
patients’ VUA health status for precision treatment, and more importantly to better engage patients in self-
managing their symptoms and create healthier outcomes."

Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder that is characterized by impaired social cognition. Social
cognition depends critically on basic perceptual processes, such as the visual perception of faces, mediated by
the fusiform face area (FFA). In prior work, we have developed the ability to measure the structure of this
region with unprecedented resolution, allowing us to partially elucidate the laminar structure of FFA. Our
approach is focused on brain structure rather than function, which avoids potential confounds related to ability,
attention, or motivation. We also focus on a small region, functionally defined in individual brains and retained
in native space, which affords improved power to conduct hypothesis-driven research relative to methods that
rely on atlas-based regions and group averaging. Our prior research suggests an inverse relation between FFA
cortical thickness (CT) and perceptual performance, which is specific to face stimuli and does not extend to
objects. When probed with ultra high-resolution (UHR) imaging, this effect is most consistent in the deepest
layers of the FFA. Our preliminary data in autism guides the following hypotheses: 1) relative to adults without
autism, autistic adults will show a higher FFA CT and a more generalized relation between FFA CT and
performance of both faces and objects, and 2) the effect will be more distributed along the radial depth of the
cortex than in non-autistic adults, reflecting different neuroplastic mechanisms. We will explore the implications
of these differences beyond the visual system by measuring functionally-defined white matter passing through
the FFA to the anterior temporal lobe. For this we will use a novel diffusion-weighted imaging pipeline that
captures both microstructural and macrostructural features of fiber bundles to increase sensitivity to
developmental and clinical changes. This project combines state-of-the-art imaging that affords ultra-high-
resolution quantification of cortical gray and white matter structure with a comprehensive battery of perceptual
tasks assessing face and object perception and memory. The outcome of this study will improve precision in
measuring anomalous development of the FFA in autism, enabling localization to distinct cortical laminae and
thus providing insight into the developmental timeline and neural mechanisms of altered experience-based
perceptual learning of faces in autism."

Bone fractures in the elderly are a serious health issue due to high morbidity and mortality. New therapies are
needed to reduce treatment time and decrease the mortality rate. Cellular senescence is closely associated with
aging and aging related diseases, including osteoporosis. However, senescent cells (SCs) are heterogenous,
and their roles in fracture repair during aging have not been well studied. We recently reported that SCs in callus
impaired age-associated fracture repair through TGFβ1 and clearance of total SCs with senolytic drugs
(Dasatinib+Quercetin, D+Q) enhanced fracture repair in aged mice only, indicating the difference of SCs in callus
between young and aged mice. With cutting-edge technology, single cell RNA sequencing in mesenchymal cells
(CD45-CD31-Ter119-) from callus identified 3 clusters of SCs: TGFβ1+CXCR2+, TGFβ1-CXCR2+,
TGFβ1+CXCR2. Very interestingly, TGFβ1+/-CXCR2+ clusters strongly inhibited CaMPC growth, indicating they
are detrimental SCs (dSCs). CXCR2 signaling promotes cellular senescence. We found that CXCR2 inhibitor
specifically removed dSCs and enhanced fracture healing in aged mice, suggesting removal of dSCs, but keep
potential beneficial SCs subsets benefit fracture healing in aged mice. To investigate the potential molecular
mechanism, we examined the role of TGFβ1 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), one of the top
expressed SASP in dSCs. TGFβ1 neutralizing Ab enhanced fracture healing in aged mice. TGFβ1 and TIMP2
neutralizing Abs synergistically inhibit the effect of SCs on CaMPC growth. The ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS) plays critical roles in age-associated bone disorders. Ub-proteomics identified PDGFRβ as one of the
most ubiquitinated proteins regulating MPC expansion, and its expression is decreased in bone and callus of
aged mice. TGFβ1 induces PDGFRβ ubiquitination and degradation, while TIMP2 decreases PDGFRβ receptor
phosphorylation and activation. We further found that CXCR2 ligand, CXCL5, which was increased in callus of
aged mice specifically induced dSCs in CaMPCs from aged mice. Thus, we hypothesize dSCs accumulate in
callus of aged mice where they produce excessive TGFβ1, TIMP2 and CXCLs, resulting in not only a positive
loop of dSC generation from CaMPCs via CXCLs, but also increased ubiquitination and decreased PDGFRβ
phosphorylation, and a reduced MPC pool, which can be prevented by selectively depleting dSCs via CXCR2
inhibition. In this application, we will 1) fully characterize dSCs phenotypically and examine if dSCs impair fracture
healing in aged mice, 2) investigate whether dSCs affect fracture repair of aged mice by regulating PDGFRβ in
CaMPCs via TGFβ1 and TIMP2. Our proposal will elucidate the role of a subset of SCs (dSCs) in aging fracture,
identify new mechanisms and novel drug targets, which could lead to interventions for geriatric fractures that are
of great morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs."

 In human brain development, the third trimester represents a critical period of cortical expansion, folding, and
white matter organization. Deviations from the normal developmental trajectory have been linked to abnormal
cortical morphologies and white matter organization, which in turn have been linked to disorders including
epilepsy, developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. However, the
mechanisms underlying folding, and hence the etiology of folding abnormalities, are the subject of active debate.
 Current evidence suggests that rapid expansion of the cortical surface is a driving force in brain folding, with
mechanical buckling or bending inducing formation of gyri (outward folds) and sulci (inward folds). However,
computational simulations of this mechanism have fallen short of predicting human brain morphology, and few
have addressed the spatiotemporal relationships that exist between folding and white matter organization.
Recently, our team uncovered regional gradients and temporal changes in the rates of cortical expansion over
development in human and animal models. We hypothesize that these expansion patterns within the cortical
plate play a crucial role in determining the timing and positioning of cortical folds in humans. Further, we
hypothesize an important role for folding-induced axon elongation in the organization of underlying white matter.
These phenomena have yet to be implemented in models of human cortical expansion and folding, and model
predictions have yet to be tested in the context of human data and disease.
 In this study, we will use two unique magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets, alongside MRI-informed
computational modeling, to determine whether observed patterns and rates of cortical expansion are sufficient
to drive normal and aberrant brain structure. In Aim 1, we will use multimodal, longitudinal MRI data from preterm
infants to assess whether patterns of cortical expansion are aligned with gradients of cortical maturation, and
whether these gradients are sufficient to induce early emerging patterns of folding. Analysis will be supplemented
with longitudinal, in-utero imaging of typically developing fetuses. In Aim 2, we will use subcortical diffusion data
from the preterm cohort to determine whether simulated, folding-induced white matter organization is consistent
with the organization observed in the developing human brain. In Aim 3, we will determine the ability of cortical
expansion-driven models to predict later emerging folds that are highly variable across individuals: first training
models on rich longitudinal datasets from preterm individuals tracked through age 10, then extending models to
preterm and typically developing individuals with more limited longitudinal data. The proposed aims will provide
unprecedented spatial and temporal detail on the relationships between cortical expansion, folding, and white
matter organization during normal and abnormal brain development in human. Furthermore, it will lay the
groundwork for future studies aimed at understanding the genesis of cortical folding abnormalities and their
relationship to developmental outcomes."

The PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTH1R) plays a pivotal role in regulating mineral ion homeostasis and bone growth. PTH1R binds both parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), activating downstream effectors, including Gsα/cAMP/PKA, SIK3 and HDAC4. The biological significance of the PTH1R is underscored by its involvement in several rare human diseases, including Jansen's Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia (JMC) and Eiken Syndrome (ES). JMC is caused by heterozygous activating PTH1R mutations, e.g. T410R, that result in delayed differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes leading to severe bone deformities and extremely short stature. Patients also exhibit severe hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). ES is caused by homozygous PTH1R mutations that result in delayed chondrocyte differentiation and bone mineralization. Some ES patients show PTH resistance without hypocalcemia. Both the JMC mutation of T410R, which maps to transmembrane helix 6, and the R485X mutation of ES, which truncates the receptor's C-terminal tail, increase the level of basal cAMP signaling by the PTH1R. Basal cAMP signaling by both PTH1R-R485X and PTH1R-T410R can be suppressed in vitro by treatment with a PTH inverse agonist (PTH-IA) ligand, but only that of PTH1R-R485X can be suppressed by overexpressing beta-arrestin 2 (βArr2), suggesting a role for the PTH1R C-tail in modulating the binding of βArr2 and Gsα to the intracellular surface of the PTH1R hepta-helical domain. To define the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinct phenotypes caused by these two PTH1R mutations and thus gain novel insights into fundamental PTH1R biology, we generated ""humanized"" PTH1R knock-in mice expressing the T410R or R485X disease alleles, and will now characterize the impact of the mutations on bone and growth plate development as well as on bone and kidney physiology. We will further use genetic and pharmacologic tools to determine the roles of ßArr2, SIK3 and HDAC4 in the mutant phenotypes (Aim 1), as well as the potential for novel PTH-IAs, administered by SC injection or minipump infusion, to have therapeutic effects (Aim 2). The overall studies will help advance development of the first treatment options for JMC."

10989123,"The Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of
nosocomial infections in humans. The emergence of A. baumannii strains resistant to
most, and in some cases, all available antibiotics has made the treatment of these
infections exceedingly difficult. This underlies the importance of finding new ways to
combat these infections. Our work has demonstrated that A. baumannii can rapidly
switch between virulent (VIR-O) and avirulent (AV-T) subpopulations. This switch is
controlled, in part, by the stochastic activation of a family of TetR-type transcriptional
regulators (TTTRs). Remarkably, these TTTRs can be activated alone or in different
combinations, representing a new mechanism for the generation of phenotypic
heterogeneity in bacteria. Expression of the TTTRs is primarily controlled at the level of
Rho-dependent transcriptional termination within the mRNA leader regions of each
TTTR. In VIR-O cells the level of termination is high and the TTTRs are OFF. In AV-T
cells, termination is blocked by an unknown mechanism and the TTTRs are expressed.
The goals of this proposal are to understand the role of a regulatory cascade beginning
with the GacSA two-component system. We hypothesize that GacA exists in a bistable
ON state in VIR-O cells and an OFF state in AV-T cells. In the ON state, a set of GacA
regulated sRNAs are expressed which inhibit the CsrA protein. In AV-T cells, GacA is
OFF and CsrA is active, and we hypothesize CsrA can then block Rho-dependent
termination in the TTTR leader regions. This switch represents a possible Achilles-heel
for A. baumannii pathogenesis and an increased understanding of the mechanisms that
regulate the switch may lead to interventions that drive virulent cells to the avirulent
state and cripple the ability to cause disease."
10978288,"Monogenic disorders individually are rare but in aggregate are common, with estimates of up to 1 in 40
individuals afflicted. In monogenic cardiovascular (CV) disease, early identification of at-risk individuals has
proven utility for prevention. Unfortunately, there is substantial clinical variability not only in identification of
monogenic CV diseases but also in therapeutic interventions for these patients, in part because of their
underdiagnosis. As such, there is a need for development of more targeted approaches for identification of
monogenic CV disorders, but that go beyond traditional diagnostic models that result in underdiagnosis. There
is an opportunity and need to integrate cutting-edge, high-throughput phenotyping approaches with
genetics to identify patients at high risk, or already showing evidence of monogenic CV disorders, and
determine if this approach can improve the care of these patients. The overall objective for this proposal is to
develop, validate and determine clinical utility of a precision genetic testing approach guided by machine
learning (ML)-based models. We hypothesize that ML electronic health record (EHR), genetic and
imaging algorithms coupled with precision genetic testing will lead to enhanced diagnosis of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR-CM). We will accomplish this
objective through the following aims: Aim 1. Refine, validate and determine generalizability of imaging-based
deep learning (DL) algorithms for HCM and ATTR-CM using echocardiograms across four health systems
caring for diverse patients (Duke, MUSC, Mayo Clinic, Cedars-Sinai); Aim 2. Aim 2. Develop, validate and
determine generalizability of an EHR-based computable phenotype for HCM and ATTR-CM in four health
systems; Aim 3. Identify HCM and ATTR-CM genetic VUS with high evidence for pathogenicity using a ML-
algorithm; and Aim 4. Determine feasibility and clinical utility of a precision genetic testing approach integrating
a DL-imaging algorithm, an EHR computable phenotype and genetic testing. This proposal holds great
potential for demonstrating clinical utility of this approach, with an output of a coordinated system that could be

 Despite the on-going debate as to whether there are changes in gut barrier function during healthy aging,
clinical studies consistently support an increased risk of infection, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction in
elderly patients following trauma and major surgical intervention. Among many contributing factors, impaired
barrier integrity of an aging gut is the essential factor to this increased risk. However, our current understanding
of the mechanisms underlying the increased vulnerability to gut barrier dysfunction during aging remains poor
and, as a result, effective therapies to preserve intestinal barrier integrity in old patients are limited. Maintaining
the gut epithelial barrier function is a complex process that requires epithelial cells to rapidly alter gene
expression patterns to regulate their interactions and survival, adaption to stress, and to maintain homeostasis.
Posttranscriptional events, particularly altered mRNA turnover and translation, are major mechanisms by which
mammalian cells control gene expression in response to various stresses. Regulation of mRNA stability and
translation is predominantly governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) including
circular RNAs (circRNAs). Recently, we have demonstrated that the RBP HuR regulates the epithelium host
defense in the intestine via Paneth cells and that the circRNA circHIPK3 enhances injury-induced regeneration
of the intestinal epithelium by reducing microRNA-29b function. However, the exact roles of HuR and circHIPK3
in regulating the intestinal barrier function in the aging epithelium remain unknown and how these new findings
can be exploited to benefit old patients is still unclear. Our preliminary results show that the level of circHIPK3
decreased remarkedly in the small intestinal mucosa of old mice and aged individuals, whereas aged mice with
HuR-deficiency exhibited an improved gut barrier function relative to age-matched control mice. Our preliminary
studies further revealed that HuR was potentially involved in promoting excessive mitochondrial clearance in the
old intestinal epithelium and that circHIPK3 acted as an enhancer of mitochondrial biogenesis. Based on our
exciting preliminary results and support from scientific literatures, we hypothesize circHIPK3 and HuR play
distinct roles in modulating mitochondrial function in aging intestinal epithelium, ultimately impacting gut barrier
function and vulnerability in the elderly undergoing pathological stress. Two specific aims are proposed to test
this hypothesis: 1) to test the hypothesis that circHIPK3 and HuR play key roles in the altered gut barrier function
observed in aging mice and humans under pathological stress compared to normal homeostasis; and 2) to test
the hypothesis that circHIPK3 and HuR regulate the epithelial barrier of the aged gut by altering IEC
mitochondrial metabolism. Completion of these specific aims will make a significant conceptual advance by
linking the circRNA circHIPK3 and RBP HuR and their effect on mitochondrial metabolism with the control of the
gut barrier function in elderly patients and will create a fundamental basis for developing novel therapies to
maintain the gut barrier integrity under various pathological conditions."

Early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD) have been important goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease since the first
Advisory Council recommendations in 2012. Major breakthroughs have been accomplished over the last 10
years using blood-based biomarkers for amyloid and tau pathologies. Over this time, the Dage lab led the
discovery and development of assays for unique phosphorylated proteoforms of tau (P-tau181 and P-tau217)
that can differentiate AD from non-AD controls or other neurodegenerative diseases. We have demonstrated
that P-tau217 is elevated 2-fold compared with controls in earliest stages of AD. These findings have been
replicated by several groups using novel assays including some immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry
(IP/MS) methods. However, it is not clear if P-tau217 represents the best proteoform at the early stages of AD,
correlates best with tau pathology, or if there are other proteoforms that might be more relevant to enable
earlier diagnosis of non-AD tauopathies such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). In fact, there has been
limited success in the search for biomarkers for non-AD tauopathies such as PSP which currently lacks
specific biofluid biomarkers despite it having genetic associations with tau haplotype and having tau pathology
as one of its defining pathological characteristics. To address outstanding questions with P-tau217 and gaps in
early detection or diagnosis of non-AD tauopathies, we have the overall objective to discover novel tau
proteoforms in blood that best differentiate healthy volunteers from AD or PSP patients and have potential to
enable early diagnosis of tau pathology for AD or PSP. Other groups have performed IP/MS studies on brain
tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or plasma; however, sensitivity limitations of their approach might be inhibiting
the full evaluation of low abundant tau forms in blood despite enrichment with IP. To overcome this limitation,
we have identified samples from completed clinical trials of tau immunotherapies (semorinemab, tilavonemab,
and gosuranemab) where the levels of tau in blood was increased more than 20-fold. By combining IP/MS
with samples from clinical trials in HV, AD or PSP subjects, we will overcome the sensitivity limitations and test
the hypothesis that novel tau proteoforms associated with AD or PSP can be identified in blood. In this project
we will identify and characterize novel tau proteoforms and make this resource available broadly to enable
future research. This will enable rapid evaluation for their association with tau pathology, disease progression,
earlier diagnosis of PSP, and help identify patients for clinical trials."

This career development award proposal aims to create an immersive training experience in the context of
studying the genetic etiology of substance use disorders (SUDs). The completion of the research and training
aims will provide the applicant with a unique skillset at the intersection of psychiatric genetics, SUD
epidemiology and health disparities, SUD psychopharmacology, clinical informatics, and bioinformatics.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been valuable for genetic discovery and dissecting the
biology of SUDs, but improvements to study design are needed. First, SUD GWAS typically account only for
diagnostic status for the focal SUD of interest; however, substance co-use and SUD co-occurrence are
common and may impact interpretation of findings. Second, SUD GWAS often rely on diagnostic codes that
are included in electronic health records (EHRs) but miss other substance use not captured by a SUD
diagnosis. EHR-based substance toxicology data can provide superior resolution of substance use and assess
if someone has been exposed to a specific substance. Third, substance exposure information is important – a
person must initiate use of a substance for a SUD to develop. To assess a person’s genetic liability for a SUD
requires knowing if that individual has been exposed to that substance. Defining substance-exposed controls
solidifies that cases and controls are accurately designated and allows for the isolation of the genetic effects
specific to SUD risk. Fourth, GWAS have been largely performed in European-ancestry samples. Efforts have
underscored the need to extend GWAS to diverse ancestries, but insufficient attention has been given to racial
disparities in SUD GWAS. The inclusion of genetically diverse populations combined with examining social
determinants of health are important for addressing health disparities in SUD GWAS. This proposal seeks to
address these limitations using the Million Veteran Program (MVP) sample – a large and diverse biobank that
includes genetic, environmental, and medical information including EHRs that contain SUD diagnoses and
drug toxicology data. EHR data will be used to identify diagnosed SUDs and co-occurring SUDs for each MVP
participant. Drug toxicology data will be used to assess for additional substance use. Combining EHR SUD
diagnostic codes and toxicology results will provide a comprehensive summary of substance use for each MVP
participant. This will benefit SUD GWAS in terms of: (1) modeling patterns of SUD co-occurrence and
substance co-use; (2) providing substance use specificity that often goes undocumented by EHR codes alone;
and (3) the ability to identify substance-exposed controls that have used a substance but do not have a SUD
diagnosis. Reducing health disparities in SUD GWAS will be addressed through the inclusion of all available
genetic ancestry groups and examining disparities in rates of toxicology test administration across self-reported
racial and sociodemographic backgrounds. This proposal will provide multidisciplinary training to help launch
the applicant’s independent research career and holds promise to advance our understanding of SUD etiology."
10990234,"Epigenetics is crucial for regulating the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) different latent gene expression programs, referred to as latency types. It has recently been discovered that these different latent programs are regulated by changes in a complex network of histone modifications, chromatin 3D structure, and epigenetic factors. However, it is still unknown what cellular signals trigger these epigenetic changes and what mechanisms couple these signals to chromatin-dependent viral gene regulation during latency. Our long-term goal is to understand how epigenetics regulates EBV latency. Cellular metabolism drives epigenetic changes as chromatin-modifying factors relay their activity on specific metabolites. Thus, metabolic changes can be coupled with transcriptional changes through epigenetic means. In the previous funding period, we identified a potential mechanism that could link NAD+ metabolism to viral EBV gene expression: PARP1 regulation of EBV chromatin; the activity of PARP1 relies on NAD+ availability. We demonstrated that: 1) EBV infection activates PARP1, and 2) PARP1 forms a complex with CTCF that controls the EBV genome 3D genome structure. Here we expand on these observations and report that in order to regulate CTCF functions and maintain an open chromatin state across the EBV genome, PARP1 may need to interact with NMNAT1. NMNAT1 is a critical nuclear enzyme for NAD+ biosynthesis in the nucleus, and an essential one for supporting PARP1 activation. We are currently confirming that NAD+ depletion alters chromatin composition and CTCF occupancy across the viral genome, eliciting cytotoxicity in EBV+ B cells. We have already identified the NuRD repressive chromatin complexes and the macroH2A1.1, a histone variant that binds NAD metabolites, as part of the mechanism that couples NAD+ levels with transcriptional changes of the EBV genome through PARP1 and CTCF. We have done this using proteomics, ChIP, and NAD+ depletion. Based on this data, we hypothesize that NAD+ metabolism influences EBV latency through PARP1-mediated chromatin changes in viral transcription programs."
10991655,"Background: Reducing suicide and suicide attempts among U.S. Veterans is a major national priority, as
more than 6,000 Veterans die by suicide every year and many more attempt suicide. In 2017, the most recent
year for which data are available, the suicide rate among Veterans was 1.5 times the rate of non-Veterans, and
the suicide rate among female Veterans was 2.2 times the rate of non-Veteran females. Current VHA suicide
risk prediction models suffer from high numbers of false negatives - Veterans not deemed at high risk of
suicide who do attempt or die by suicide. These suicide prediction models have not incorporated the rich
information from clinical progress notes that may improve our ability to predict suicidal behavior. Much of this
information in clinical progress notes is unstructured free text. A suicide-specific ontology and information
extraction system that can extract suicide-related information from unstructured clinical progress notes is not
available.
Significance/Impact: Enhancing VHA's ability to identify Veterans who are most likely to attempt suicide
ensures that limited intervention resources can be focused on Veterans with the highest risk, before they
attempt suicide or die by suicide. The proposed study is well-aligned with priorities for HSR&D research and
with VA strategic goals for 2018 – 2024 set out by VA leadership, who listed suicide prevention as “VA's
highest clinical priority.”
Innovation: Our key methodological innovation is to pair a state-of-the-art theoretical framework (3-step
Theory of Suicide) to predict who is most likely to act on their suicidal thoughts with state-of-the-art data
science methods (NLP, machine learning). Since our suicide-theory concepts, that is hopelessness,
connectedness, psychological pain, and capacity for suicide, are not represented in structured patient data, we
will develop novel NLP and information extraction tools and apply them to clinical progress notes, the potential
of which has not been fully levied to improve suicide prediction models.
Specific Aims: We have three specific aims:
 1. Develop a suicide-specific ontology for machine recognition of hopelessness, connectedness,
 psychological pain, and capacity for suicide in progress notes of clinical encounters with Veterans who
 attempted or died by suicide.
 2. Extract information on the presence and intensity of hopelessness, connectedness, psychological pain,
 and capacity for suicide in clinical progress notes and describe change in these concepts in proximity of
 a suicide or suicide attempt.
 3. Determine the predictive validity of hopelessness, connectedness, psychological pain, and capacity for
 suicide regarding Veteran suicide attempts and mortality in two prediction models that VA currently
 uses in clinical practice: STORM and REACHVET.
Methodology: The proposed mixed-methods study has an exploratory sequential design where a qualitative
component (Aim 1) informs quantitative analyses (Aims 2 and 3). Data collection will be from existing clinical
progress notes in VHA's Corporate Data Warehouse, VA's Suicide Prevention Applications Network and from
the VA/DoD Suicide Data Repository. We will use linguistic annotation and thematic analysis for Aim 1 and
natural language processing and machine learning models for Aims 2 and 3. The target population is Veterans
who receive care through VHA.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our most important next step is to be in regular contact with local and national
colleagues at the VA Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention (OMHSP) to facilitate implementation of
our results in the operational versions of STORM and REACHVET."

revealed that this effect of m6A is mediated in part by its ability to regulate “symmetric commitment,” in which a
stem cell differentiates into two daughter cells that both adopt the same new cell identity. We recently
identified SON, one of the most highly methylated transcripts in hematopoietic stem cells, as a major mediator
of m6A-dependent control of symmetric commitment. However, the mechanism by which SON regulates these
phenomena is unclear, and moreover it is unclear if deregulated m6A control over SON contributes to the
undifferentiated phenotype of AML cells. Inhibitors of METTL3, the m6A biosynthetic enzyme, are a promising
approach to target AML, but appear to exhibit diverse effects in cells not seen with METTL3 knockout. Also,
unlike METTL3 knockout, METTL3 inhibitors also appear to preferentially target cancer cells. A major goal is
to understand the basis for the actions of METTL3 inhibitors compared to METTL3 knockout and to determine
if specific cellular pathways can influence whether cells, and ultimately patients, would be more or less
sensitive to METTL3 inhibitor treatment. To significantly advance our understanding of epitranscriptomic
regulation in cancer, the specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To define the functional requirement for SON
and nuclear RNA methylation on cell fate in leukemia. In this aim we will use a new conditional knockout
mouse model to dissect SON's stage-specific role, clarifying its impact on METTL3-related blood phenotypes.
We will determine SON's importance in leukemia and unravel its downstream targets, mRNA regulatory
mechanisms, and links to the RNA methylation. (2) To identify pathways and mechanisms that make
cancer cells sensitive to METTL3 inhibition. Our preliminary data show that METTL3 inhibitors cause
marked reorganization of nuclear architecture, and their effects can be overcome by forced expression of
YTHDC1. We have also identified additional suppressors of METTL3 inhibitors by performing a base editor
screen to generate >600 oncogenic mutations and probing how the mutations affect sensitivity to METTL3
inhibitors. We will broadly identify how YTHDC1 and these newly discovered oncogenic pathways influence
the m6A pathway and METTL3 inhibitors. (3) To determine the function of m66A in MYC mRNA. Our
studies revealed the presence of a previously unidentified epitranscriptomic mark, N6,N6-dimethyladenosine
(m6,6A) as a highly prevalent evolutionarily conserved modification in MYC mRNA. We will determine the
prevalence and functional significance of this new modification, and determine how it impacts the oncogenic
function of MYC. Overall, this project develops new technologies and tests innovative mechanisms to uncover
novel mechanisms of epitranscriptomic regulation of cancer."

lipid peroxides, known executioners of ferroptosis.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that wt-IDH1 through enhanced lipid repair, heightened MUFA

ferroptosis, a recently discovered form of cell death has rapidly gained recognition as a paradigm shifting
strategy to specifically target cancer cells. We further hypothesize that wt-IDH1 inhibition cooperates with
known inducers of ferroptosis, including RT and immune-mediated checkpoint inhibition, to antagonize HGG
progression. For the pharmacological inhibition of wt-IDH1, we have used and characterized 13i, a first-in-
class competitive ???-unsaturated enone, developed by AbbVie. 13i potently inhibits wt-IDH1 enzymatic
activity, by covalently binding to the NADP+ binding pocket. Our data indicate that 13i promotes ferroptosis,
is brain-penetrant, and like genetic ablation, reduces progression and extends the survival of IDH1-wthigh
HGG bearing mice, alone and in combination with RT. We will test these hypotheses in three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine how wt-IDH1 impacts de novo fatty acid biosynthesis and membrane phospholipid

Aim 2. Determine how wt-IDH1 promotes GPX4-dependent lipid repair and antagonizes ferroptosis.
Aim 3: Determine if genetic and pharmacological inactivation of wt-IDH1 amplifies ferroptosis in
 response to RT and immune checkpoint blockade and antagonizes HGG progression.
Objectives and long-term goals. We will credential wt-IDH1 as regulator of ferroptosis in HGG and will
validate the pharmacological inhibition of wt-IDH1 using a novel NADP+ competitive inhibitor as a therapeutic
strategy. Results from these studies are expected to inform the design of IND-enabling studies evaluating
the potential of 13i as adjuvant for anti-HGG therapy."

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is the most common systemic rheumatic disease affecting older adults. Despite
this, PMR remains critically understudied. One in three individuals with PMR have persistent symptoms for
several years, which leads to prolonged use of glucocorticoids and prescribed analgesics. Gaps in
understanding why symptoms persist and treatment is prolonged have limited the development of interventions
to improve the well-being of this vulnerable population. Frailty is a syndrome of aging characterized by
increased vulnerability to stressors and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Preliminary data has
shown a high prevalence of frailty in patients with PMR and an association with worse self-reported pain and
physical function. Frailty might identify a subset of older adults with PMR with worse symptoms and at risk for
prolonged treatment, where tailored interventions and management could lead to improved outcomes. Physical
activity interventions such as physical and occupational therapy (PT/OT), have been shown to improve
symptoms and mobility in older adults with chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Little is known about the factors
that determine access to PT/OT in older adults with PMR as well the impact of PT/OT utilization on
glucocorticoid treatment duration. Instead of utilizing a disease-centric approach, this proposal intends to
address existing knowledge gaps by better understanding the impact of a clinically relevant geriatric syndrome
and the potential benefits of function modification in older adults with PMR. In the absence of large cohorts,
large administrative data allows the study of older adults with PMR and the assessment of frailty, medication
usage, and PT/OT interventions, to effectively address important knowledge gaps and inform healthcare
interventions. This study will utilize Medicare data to create an inception cohort of older adults with PMR
(incident PMR) and achieve the following 2 aims. In Aim, we 1 will determine the association of frailty with
glucocorticoid duration and prescription analgesic use. And in Aim 2, we will examine the association of the
utilization of PT services with glucocorticoid duration in older adults with PMR, including its effect on frail and
non-frail older adults with PMR. This proposal will provide a novel focus assessing the impact of frailty in older
adults with PMR utilizing real-world and population-level data. Understanding the role of frailty in these patients
could change the paradigm of treatment of PMR, highlighting the importance function modification
management complementing disease-oriented treatment. Better understanding of the use of PT/OT
interventions in older adults with PMR could be expanded to older adults living with other systemic rheumatic
diseases. This proposal will also support my training and transition towards a career as an independent
clinician-scientist focused on improving the care of older adults living with systemic rheumatic diseases."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are significant public
health concerns in the United States, with substantial economic and societal implications. While these
disorders have a notable hereditary component, there is growing recognition of the role environmental factors
play in their development. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy, a critical
period for neurodevelopment, may have adverse effects on fetal brain development. An expanding body of
evidence supports associations between prenatal EDC exposure and behavioral problems related to ASD and
ADHD. However, there remains a substantial knowledge gap regarding the molecular mechanisms through
which prenatal EDC exposure influences neurodevelopment. Inflammation/immune dysregulation and
epigenetic modifications have emerged as potential mediators in this complex pathway. Prenatal EDC
exposure could lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses or DNA methylation changes, which are further
related to neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD. However, few epidemiological studies have
comprehensively addressed these chemical exposures, potential mediators, and neurodevelopmental
outcomes in a single investigation. Leveraging the rich dataset available through the Environmental influences
on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program, the proposed research seeks to evaluate the mediating role of
cytokines and DNA methylation in this association, addressing crucial gaps in our understanding of the etiology
of ASD and ADHD. To achieve this overarching goal, three specific aims will be pursued: (1) examine whether
prenatal EDC levels, as an individual compound or in a mixture, are associated with behavioral problems
assess using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) during early
childhood (n~3000); (2) perform mediation analysis to evaluate cytokines in prenatal maternal blood and cord
blood as potential mediators (n~400); and (3) perform mediation analysis using the “Meet-in-the-Middle”
approach to evaluate cord blood DNA methylation as a potential mediator (n~400). Throughout the duration of
this award, I will engage in multidisciplinary mentored training in immunology, epigenetics, molecular
epidemiology, and statistical methodologies of analyzing complex chemical mixtures, cytokine and DNA
methylation data, and mediation analysis integrated with mixture approaches. I will interact with trainees and
faculty at both UC Davis and the broader ECHO program, having the opportunity to discuss and present my
work and to engage with and lead collaborative teams. These training and research activities will prepare me
to transition into an independent researcher in environmental epidemiology with a specific focus on molecular
mechanisms. Ultimately, this will contribute to advancing our understanding of how prenatal EDC exposure
operates through molecular mechanisms to influence child neurodevelopment."

To conquer cancer, researchers with diverse backgrounds and expertise must work together to discover
molecular targets and develop therapeutics. Many investigators are unable to accomplish their research goals
without access to specialized expertise, sophisticated technologies, and/or expensive instrumentation that are
impossible to master or operate in their own labs. The members of the P30CA125123 grant-supported Dan L
Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at BCM are funded with more than $180M cancer research
grants with over $41M NCI grants (direct costs). Dr. Reddy, a highly accomplished cancer physician scientist, is
the Program Director of the P30 grant, the director of the DLDCCC, and the Unit Director of this R50 application.
As a Genetically Engineered Rodent Models (GERM) core-based non-tenure track research specialist (RS) and
the Technical Director of the GERM core, I devote >70% of my effort to play an irreplaceable role in providing
comprehensive mouse cancer model services to these NCI-funded cancer research programs with my specialty
and our GERM core’s state-of-the-art equipment. These services include: generation of various genetically
engineered mouse (GEM) models by the CRISPR/Cas9 system using zygotes, the gene-targeting system using
embryonic stem (ES) cells, or the microinjection of transgenes into zygotes; in vitro fertilization and embryo
transfer to rederive and/or quickly expand GEM models; cryopreservation of sperm and embryos for long-term
storage of GEM lines; and genotype analysis of GEM lines. In the past 5 years, I and my team members have
generated 1653 knockout, knock-in and transgenic GEM models, many of which are essential for the success of
many NCI-funded cancer research programs. I am a highly experienced cancer researcher who has published
over 80 manuscripts. I have mastered methodologies and hold specialized expertise necessary for mouse and
rat embryo manipulation and genome engineering. I am a core leader who has contributed significantly to NCI-
funded cancer research programs led by other investigators. Funding of this R50 application will provide me with
a higher degree of autonomy to develop new technologies and services. In collaboration with investigators, I will
develop new embryo manipulation and genome editing systems for rat and Nile rat, as well as new genome-
editing methods/strategies for mouse, such as prime editing to minimize off-targeting events, and approaches to
increase conditional allele production efficiency and conditionally express disease-associated variants. I will
implement these new systems and technologies into our core services to better serve cancer researchers with
novel rodent cancer models. With the R50 support, I will update my knowledge and ensure the usage of the best
genome-editing system and methodology to generate rodent models by attending meetings and interacting with
other leaders in the field. My goal is to make our GERM core fully capable of providing comprehensive services
of mouse, rat and Nile rat cancer models to support cancer research, and develop my career into an
internationally recognized RS in the field of rodent genome editing and rodent cancer models."
10990784,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Motor cortex is the brain area most responsible for voluntary movement. In humans, damage to motor cortex or
its outputs – for example due to stroke or disease – causes profound and often permanent movement deficits.
Treating dysfunction, or finding ways to bypass it, requires a principled understanding of normal function.
Fundamental to that goal is the need to characterize the relationship between motor-cortex neural activity and
movement. Attempts to do so must contend with a striking feature of motor cortex neural responses: their
complexity and heterogeneity. Motor cortex responses are floridly multiphasic and remarkably diverse. Each
recorded neuron has a unique response pattern, different from the last hundred neurons one observed.
Attempts to understand motor cortex computation must therefore embrace, and hopefully explain, response
complexity. Our field was initially resistant to this path – response complexity seemed like a bug rather than a
feature. Yet as the nature and extent of response complexity became inescapable, hypotheses have
increasingly sought to explain complexity as a natural consequence of the ‘job’ performed by motor cortex.
Three possible sources of response complexity have been considered: (1) representation of many movement
parameters, (2) biomechanical complexity, and (3) complexity of neural dynamics in which motor cortex
participates. While all three sources presumably contribute, current hypotheses make very different
assumptions regarding which source predominates. Distinguishing amongst these hypotheses – and informing
new ones – has been difficult for a straightforward reason: most laboratory tasks engage all three sources of
complexity. To make headway, we combine multiple innovations. These include very large-scale neural
recordings (using many Neuropixels probes simultaneously) and recordings of motor-unit (MU) populations
from the muscles. Critically, we leverage a novel task that minimizes physical complexity while maintaining – or
even increasing – the complexity of internal computations needed for accurate performance. We use recently
developed analysis tools that are ideally suited to addressing the central questions, and will compare results
with network models that embody competing hypotheses. The resulting datasets are expected to be unusually
rich, and thus capable of both testing current hypotheses and informing new ones."

October 29 – November 2, 2024
The fourth installment of the international Microbiome conference at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory will include the latest research exploring the etiology and treatment of a wide-range of
microbe-associated diseases, integrating the disciplines of clinical research, microbiology,
immunology, ecology, bioinformatics and genomics. From the prior meetings in 2019 (inaugural,
in-person), 2020 (virtual due to COVID), 2022 (hybrid), it was clear that the CSHL Microbiome
meeting offers a unique forum where a wide variety of disciplines come together to catalyze new
ideas and integrate approaches focused on the myriad roles microbiomes play in human health.
The explicitly broad definition of microbiomes discussed at this conference will allow for continued
mutual fertilization of ideas, techniques and theories developed by researchers active in clinical,
ecological and evolutionary lines of research. As well as bringing established leaders as speakers,
this meeting will focus on young investigators and trainees to facilitate the scientific interactions
necessary to grow this field and develop novel clinical and experimental approaches, diagnostics
and therapies. The meeting will provide an in-depth focus on both experimental and computational
approaches that are being used to elucidate the mechanisms of microbial community assembly,
inflammatory, immunologic and infectious diseases. We will also explore novel roles for the
microbiome in drug metabolism and response. Microbiome studies that are featured in the oral
presentations will include bacterial, fungal and viral associated disease, and include microbe-
microbe interactions. Oral and poster sessions will focus on major themes of microbiome and the
host response, including Pathogens and Microbial Communities; Using all the Data: Bioinformatic
Analyses; Microbial Molecules and Interactions; Microbes as Machines; Environment and The
Microbiome; Microbial Function, Host Response; Human and Animal Model Studies; Microbial
Ecology and Evolution. The meeting will include two plenary keynote speakers invited to give
longer talks. The oral sessions will begin with two invited talks from established leaders in the
field, followed by 6 shorter talks chosen from submitted abstracts. The inclusion of poster sessions
as well as the allotment of ample time for questions following each talk will encourage extensive
discussion between the participants. The meeting will be small enough (250 - 350 scientists
attending in-person, with an additional virtual audience to broaden access) to facilitate these
interactions, yet large enough to allow for oral presentations from younger investigators and those
with novel perspectives. The integration of a wide variety of aspects of microbiome research will
nucleate new interdisciplinary interactions that will drive this innovative translational field. This
meeting will be distinct in the opportunities for young investigators to present their work and the
coalescence of computational, experimental and clinical disciplines."
10999683,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most common genetic syndromes, with a birth prevalence of 1 in 700 that
has been increasing in recent years. Children with DS encounter many adverse health outcomes including 1)
structural birth defects – which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality; 2) abnormal
hematopoiesis – which infers a 20-fold increased risk of acute leukemia; and 3) neurodevelopmental
disorders – which significantly impact functional independence and quality of life. However, there are important
gaps in our understanding: 1) inter-individual variability exists among children with DS in relation to these
phenotypes that cannot be fully explained; 2) the natural history of these phenotypes among children with DS
has not been comprehensively evaluated, limiting health supervision guidelines and targets for intervention; and
3) children with DS, particularly those from underrepresented minorities, have often been excluded from
participation in research that could improve their outcomes. In this application, we seek to address these gaps
in knowledge. Specifically, in response to RFA-OD-24-003 (Down Syndrome Cohort Research Sites for the
INCLUDE Project), we propose to leverage the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR) – one of the world’s largest
and most diverse population-based active birth defects surveillance systems – to develop the Down syndrome
Early Childhood Omics, Deep phenotyping, and Epidemiology In Texas: DECODE IT Cohort. As part of
DECODE IT, we will recruit an ethnically and geographically diverse birth cohort of children with DS with the
objectives of 1) conducting deep phenotyping and 2) collecting biospecimens for omics assessments. Our
research team is uniquely poised to develop this population-based cohort of children with DS. We bring expertise
in DS research and recruitment (Lupo and Rasmussen), DS-related birth defects (Agopian), DS-associated
hematopoiesis (Rabin), and neurodevelopment in children with DS (Jacola). Furthermore, we have an extensive
record of collaborations. Therefore, we propose the following aims: 1) recruit children with DS to the DECODE
IT Cohort; 2) Conduct deep phenotyping on children with DS enrolled in DECODE IT – with a particular emphasis
on structural birth defects, hematopoietic development, and neurodevelopment; 3) Prospectively collect
biospecimens on children with DS enrolled in DECODE IT for biomarker and omics studies. IMPACT: Through
DECODE IT we will establish a large population-based cohort (N=1,000 children with DS) that will provide the
necessary foundation for propelling our understanding, prediction, and prevention of associated adverse health
outcomes in children with DS."
10999750,"Project summary:
Increasing lines of evidence in mammals have shown that certain acquired traits during paternal environmental
exposure (e.g., unhealthy diet) can be “memorized” in sperm and transmitted to the future generations without
altering the DNA sequence. Our research seeks to unravel the epigenetic mechanisms by which paternal
environmental factors, like diet, are encoded in sperm RNA and influence offspring health. Building on our
discovery of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) and rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs) in sperm and their
role in intergenerational inheritance, we have raised the concept of 'sperm RNA code'—an RNA
expression/modification signature—that is sensitive to paternal experiences such as diet and stress. However,
the mechanisms by which sperm tsRNAs/rsRNAs and their modifications impact offspring by penetrating the
embryo development process remain largely unknown and await to be addressed. This renewal of our NIH R01
project aims to advance the study of epigenetic inheritance via sperm RNAs, which will extend from our
innovative tools developed from the last funding period, including PANDORA-seq, which uncovers modified
tsRNA/rsRNA that are previously undetectable; and MLC-seq, a novel mass spectrometry-based method to map
multiple RNA modifications of tsRNAs/rsRNAs. We’ll use these new tools to uncover the alterations of
tsRNAs/rsRNAs and their RNA modification under high-fat diet (HFD), and how they regulate offspring
phenotype via early embryonic events such as lineage differentiation. Our preliminary data reveal that tsRNAs
and rsRNAs are uniquely expressed in sperm heads, and that some of them are regulators of cell lineage
differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells, leading to the hypothesis that they can skew the embryonic lineage
balance between the inner-cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE), thus a mechanism for influencing balanced
fetus-placenta development. We will systematically explore this potential mechanism by 1) leverage PANDORA-
seq and MLC-seq to identify the modified sperm tsRNAs/rsRNAs responsive to HFD and to examine their roles
by zygotic RNA injection regarding regulations on embryonic cell fate decisions and subsequent fetus:placenta
development; 2) quantify the relationship between dysregulated fetus-placenta weight ratio during mid- and late-
pregnancy to metabolic phenotypes in offspring in a sex-specific manner. 3) Investigate the molecular interplay
of tsRNAs/rsRNAs with nuclear ribonucleoproteins, providing insights into how these interactions may regulate
ribosomal function and translational specificity and thus, embryonic cell lineage outcomes. Collectively, this
research strives to dissect the complex cellular mechanisms underpinning paternal environmental exposure-
induced epigenetic inheritance. It aims to establish deeper insight in understanding the cellar and developmental
origin of sperm RNA-induced epigenetic inheritance upon paternal environmental exposure."
10999830,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the Spike protein, there remains an urgent need
for vaccines that are both effective against variants and that generate long-lived mucosal immunity. Generation
of durable cell-mediated and humoral immunity is critical for optimal naturally occurring and vaccine-induced
protection against respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and includes IFN-γ and IL-17 producing tissue-
resident memory T (TRM) cells, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, germinal center (GC) and memory B cells, that
contribute to the production of pathogen-specific neutralizing antibodies.
Most currently approved vaccines are adjuvanted with alum, which is a strong adjuvant that elicits TH2 skewed
cellular and humoral responses, associated with short-lived immunity to intracellular respiratory pathogens.
Experimental adjuvants that generate TH1 and TH17 driven systemic and mucosal responses, provide effective
and long-lived protection against infection.
Bordetella Colonization Factor A (BcfA) is an adjuvant that elicits strong TH1 and TH17 responses and has the
unique ability to attenuate the detrimental TH2 responses primed by alum. Polyfunctional IL-21 and IFN-γ (TFH1
cells) or IL-21 and IL-17 (TFH17 cells) cells are important for generation of effective antibodies against viral
respiratory pathogens. The TH1/TH17 skewing properties of BcfA may promote the differentiation and function of
these specialized TFH cell populations.
Mucosal vaccination is a more effective means of generating tissue-resident memory that is not generated by
parenterally administered alum-adjuvanted vaccines. A prime-pull regimen (systemic priming and intranasal
booster) generates mucosal responses to vaccines containing TH1/TH17 skewing adjuvants and provides
superior protection. We will test the overarching hypothesis that a BcfA/alum-adjuvanted subunit SARS
CoV-2 vaccine containing S, M and N proteins, delivered via a heterologous prime-pull immunization regimen
will reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mouse respiratory tract and elicit long-lived systemic and
mucosal TH1/TH17 driven immune responses."

11001302,"RCC Summary: The long-term goal of the Research Capacity Core (RCC) is to support, strengthen, and
expand biomedical and behavioral research projects at Florida A&M University (FAMU). Over the past three
decades, tremendous success has been achieved by FAMU RCMI Center through the active support of the
research infrastructure (RIC) component of the RCMI Program. FAMU researchers have relied on the RIC
services by using key instrumental analysis and research personnel to gather data used to write NIH
proposals, develop funded projects, publish in refereed and indexed scientific journals, and successfully
train graduate students. There is a critical need to invigorate these strategies in order to continue
strengthening the campus biomedical and behavioral research activities, especially under the current rapid
technological advancements. The focus of the FAMU RCMI U54 RCC will be on promoting innovative
technologies that support the proposed RCMI research projects, pilot projects, and other FAMU biomedical
and behavioral research initiatives that address health disparities experienced by racial and ethnic
minorities, the rural and urban poor, and other medically underserved populations. The RCC will provide
state-of-the-art multi-disciplinary facilities, including the following technologies A) Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance (NMR) and Mass Analysis Facility, B) Molecular Modeling Facility, C) High Throughput Screening
and Drug Design (HTS-DD) Facility D) Multi-Omics Resource (MOR) Facility (E) Proteomics and Cytokine (PC)
Facility F) Flow Cytometry/Imaging (FI) Facility and G) Artificial Intelligence (AI), Bioinformatics and Statistics
(ABS) Data Management Facility. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be woven through all cores, applying the
massive biological and public health data now available to propel predictive drug discovery, and expedite
new discoveries in biomedical and behavioral research. The formation of an RCMI Committee is proposed
that will address all pertinent AI issues: providing directives on training modules, workshops, consultations,
and adopted deliberate and appropriate AI approaches. AI issues dealing with ethics, data privacy, risk
management and liability concerns will be carefully considered. Similarly, the RCC will also promote
leading edge scientific technology by providing workshops, seminars, and short courses in drug
discovery and biotechnology research applications to enhance research proficiency. The proposed RCC is
relevant to the NIH/NIMHD mission of developing the research infrastructure and training investigators to
be more successful in obtaining competitive extramural support in biomedical and behavioral research that
addresses minority health and health disparities."

The major goal of the Investigator Development Core (IDC) is (1) to provide significant research support
to minority early career investigators and junior faculty with innovative pilot projects and (2) to offer the
recipients a mentoring program that will improve their ability to achieve their long-term success as
independent Investigators who obtain extramural funding (mentored K award and R series funding). The
IDC will fund Pilot Projects to support senior research associates or junior faculty with grant support
ranging from $30,000 to 50,000 annually for two years. Grantees will be able to use core facilities at no
cost. The IDC will provide the awardees with resources, mentors, and other strategic components to
ensure success in reaching their research career goals. The specific aims of this project are to (1)
Provide a structured procedure for the selection of the pilot project awardees. 2) Provide awardees
with grant support with a robust mentoring program for the development of successful
researchers. 3) Provide a monitoring process to evaluate the IDC Investigators' Progress. The IDC
committee (IDC, CEC, and other Core leaders) and RCMI Executive Committee will review the pilot project
applications. Criteria for evaluating the pilot projects include scientific novelty, technical merit,
significance/relevance to health disparities, experience and qualifications of the applicant, and record of
accomplishments. Initial local evaluations of each project will be followed by NIH-style evaluations and
scoring of the proposed work by three external evaluators (R01 scientists or equivalent levels) with similar
research interests to the proposed project. Awardees will present their outcomes in progress quarterly
with oral presentations to the committee and mentors of each awardee to obtain inputs on the scientific
ideas and directions of the projects. The progress of the pilot projects will be reviewed and evaluated
quarterly by the IDC committee. The pilot project awardees will closely interact with the Research
Capacity Core and Community Engagement Core and attend monthly seminars/workshops with renowned
external speakers. An investigator must make significant progress by the end of the first year to ensure
funding for the second year is awarded. The committee will actively work with each awardee and mentor
to prepare competitive NIH grant applications. The awardee is expected to publish at least two research
articles in high-impact journals at the end of the two years of funding. By the end of the award's second
year, awardees must submit research grants to federal agencies, such as mentored K award and R series
proposals, using the preliminary data obtained from pilot project awards. Implementing the outlined plan
is expected to result in successful minority scientists, well-trained in health disparities, with the knowledge
and credentials to obtain mainstream external funding."
11001304,"Community Engagement Core (CEC) Summary
One of FAMU RCMI Center's major goals is to reduce cancer health disparities among minorities and
underserved populations. Cancer health disparities refer to the adverse differences in cancer measures,
such as incidence, mortality, screening rates, and access to care, among specific population groups.
These disparities can be observed between racial and ethnic groups, socioeconomic groups, geographic
locations, and more. Achieving better health outcomes requires an integrated, patient-centered healthcare
system, multisectoral engagement, community organizing, social action, and reducing health inequities.
African Americans continue to have the highest death rate for most types of cancer and the shortest survival
of any racial/ethnic group in the United States. Overall, about 1 in 2 African American men and 1 in 3
African American women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. The causes of these inequalities
are complex and reflect social and economic disparities, such as barriers to high-quality cancer prevention,
early detection, and treatment information and services. Additionally, multiple social and cultural barriers
have been identified that impede screening and early detection, especially among underserved minority
populations. Over the last few years, extensive evidence has shown the benefits of active and equitable
community participation in health research and promotion to address problems related to social and
structural inequities that significantly affect underserved populations. The mission of the CEC is to
establish, identify, and support partnerships with the community to create a sustainable research
environment for reducing cancer disparities. The CEC will strengthen the capacity of academic and
community partners to reduce cancer disparities by increasing interaction between FAMU RCMI scientists
and the community as well as dissemination of RCMI's research, use of artificial intelligence (AI) in
research, and promoting participation in RCMI research studies. Also, the core will develop and implement
culturally sensitive outreach activities to improve health literacy, cancer screening, and cancer prevention
through nutrition education."
11001306,"Project-1 Summary/Abstract: Although mortality rates for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in the US
have been rapidly declining with the onset of successful endocrine therapy [i.e., aromatase inhibitors (AI) and
selective estrogen receptor modulators] and targeted therapy (ie., cdk 4/6 inhibitors), the development of re-
sistance remains a lingering clinical challenge. Unfortunately, once resistance develops, the tumors spread and
become estrogen-independent, thereby limiting favorable therapeutic outcomes. The long-term goal is to better
understand the mechanism(s) of AI-resistant breast cancer, in order to contribute to both the improvement of
current therapeutic modalities and the development of novel treatment strategies. The objective of this applica-
tion is to define the functional relevance and consequence of midasin expression in the endocrine resistant
setting. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that overexpression of midasin poises cells for en-
docrine resistance by increasing plasticity, cell cycle dysregulation, genomic instability, and reprogramming the
transcriptional landscape. The rationale for the proposed project is that defining the relationship between aber-
rant midasin expression and AI-resistance could aid in the discovery new pathways to restore sensitivity to re-
sistant tumors. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims:
1) To elucidate the impact of midasin expression on stemness of letrozole-resistant breast cancer; 2) To deter-
mine the consequence of midasin alterations on cell cycle dysregulation and genomic instability; and 3) To in-
terrogate the role of ESR1 mutations and midasin alterations in promoting a more aggressive phenotype. Under
the first aim, we will use 2D and 3D tissue cell culture to analyze CSC formation, proliferation, motility, metastasis,
and its resultant biology in letrozole-sensitive and letrozole-resistant breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in
which midasin has been genetically and pharmacologically. Under the second aim, we will alter midasin expres-
sion in letrozole-sensitive and letrozole-resistant breast cancer cells containing targeting vectors with empty,
over-expressed, and/or knocked down midasin and analyze cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, DNA dam-
age, and apoptosis and its resultant biology. Under the third aim, MCF-7 cells containing stable point mutations
in the ER LBD and measure ER transcriptional activity, recruitment of p160 coactivators, and its subsequent
biology upon genetic and pharmacological midasin manipulation. The proposed research is conceptually inno-
vative, because dissecting the consequences of aberrant midasin expression will uncover key pathways that
may be instrumental in selectively targeting this phenotype and ultimately restoring hormone sensitivity of endo-
crine breast cancer. This is proposed research is significant because it will elucidate the impact of midasin on
de novo and acquired AI-resistance and will be the first in the series of studies that will improve our knowledge
of how to selectively target this phenotype."
11001307,"Project Summary/Abstract: Neuropathic pain is estimated in the general population to range between 3%
and 17%, and lacks an effective treatment, as most of the available treatments have only moderate efficacy
and present significant side effects including addiction that limit their use. Therefore, other therapeutic
approaches are needed to replace the addictive opioids that are the mainstay of current treatment.
5-HT7R agonists including AS-19, E-55888, LP-12, LP-44, LP-211, AGH-192 and compound 1g have been
reported in the literature and have been used to characterize the involvement of the 5-HT7R in CNS conditions
including pain, memory and cognition. More recently, 5-HT7R agonists have been implicated in the treatment
of neuropathic pain, sleep disorders, and alcohol and drug abuse. However, there are divergent views reported
in the literature regarding the role of the 5-HT7R ligands in their pharmacological actions. While these
controversial roles of 5-HT7R may depend on non-selectivity at other CNS receptors, and/or on different brain
regions and the neurochemical environment in which the receptors are located, or even receptor-receptor
interactions, some of the inconsistent pharmacological effects may be explained by the different signaling
pathways associated with the 5-HT7R, including G protein biased, β-arrestin biased or balanced signaling at
both pathways. Current evidence indicates that 5-HT7R ligands activate not only G protein but also β-arrestin
signaling pathways and that no β-arrestin-biased ligands that selectively interact with 5-HT7R have been
disclosed other than compound 1g reported in a JMC paper in 2018. In addition, a recent PNAS paper reported
serodolin behaves as an antagonist/inverse agonist on Gs signaling while inducing ERK activation through a
β-arrestin–dependent signaling mechanism that requires activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, c-Src.
Serodolin was also shown to decrease hyperalgesia and pain sensation in response to inflammatory, thermal,
and mechanical stimulation. Thus, in this proposal, we hypothesize that 5-HT7R ligands that recruit β-arrestin
to the receptor would produce antinociceptive effects and may serve as alternatives to the use of opioids.
To begin addressing several of these issues, we have proposed three specific aims as follows: Specific Aim 1
will optimize the very high affinity (5-HT7R, Ki = 0.16 nM) lead compound (55933) by designing, synthesizing,
and evaluating the binding affinities of new agents that are more drug-like and capable of improving 55933’s
metabolic profile. Specific aim 2, will investigate the drug-like characteristics of optimized lead compounds
identified and/or proposed in specific aim 1 including their brain permeability. And in specific aim 3, the in vivo
efficacy evaluation of test compounds for antinociception and neuropathic pain will be carried out."
11001308,"Project Summary
Research has highlighted the higher incidence and mortality rates of cervical cancer among Hispanic women
compared to non-Hispanic white women in the U.S. These disparities are even more pronounced when only
Hispanic immigrant women are considered because of greater individual and structural barriers to health care.
Effective community-based interventions are needed to address these health disparities, with the testing,
implementation, and evaluation of a promotora, or a lay health advisor, as one potentially effective strategy.
The overall objective of this study is to test an innovative, community-based, theory-driven, eHealth cervical
cancer screening intervention delivered in a group setting to Hispanic women living in northern Florida. The
primary research hypothesis is that a promotora intervention delivered electronically will increase adherence to
recommendations for cervical cancer screening among Hispanic women who are not up to date (≥3 years)
compared to women in a control group by over 15% favoring the intervention. The rationale that underlies the
proposed research is that interventions using promotoras are a culturally appropriate, potentially effective
strategy for increasing adherence to cervical cancer screening guidelines and follow-up for abnormal findings
in Hispanic populations. The three specific aims are to: (1) update a previously tested small media promotora
intervention (e.g., pamphlets and videos), which is designed to improve knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and
accurate risk perceptions for cervical cancer and human papillomavirus and promote positive cervical cancer
screening behaviors among Hispanic women; (2) test the effectiveness of the updated group-based, eHealth
promotora intervention using a cluster randomized controlled trial design to increase participation in cervical
cancer screening for Hispanic women who are not up to date with screening; and (3) conduct a cost-
effectiveness analysis of the promotora intervention. The study will be strengthened by the establishment of a
community-academic partnership. The contribution of the proposed research is expected to be the
development of an effective eHealth group intervention which can be delivered by a promotora to increase
screening among Hispanic immigrants in rural settings. Moreover, the intervention focuses on Hispanics who
have settled in the southeastern U.S., an understudied population in terms of cancer education research. At
the conclusion of the study, the following outcomes are expected: (1) refinement of a small media intervention
that is evidence-based; (2) improvement in diverse community partnership networks and opportunities for
building research infrastructure by working with the Community Engagement and Research Capacity cores;
and (3) identification of next steps for a follow-up study, including expanding the study to include HPV self-
sampling for cervical cancer screening."
10981044,"Metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients, and its early detection and prevention are currently
difficult. Thus, a better understanding of the earliest stages of metastasis, is an important and presently unmet
challenge. The objective of this application is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to the
formation of the pre-metastatic niche (PMN), an early step in the metastatic process, with the goal of finding
targets for intervention. The focus of this highly collaborative grant is on the role of tumor-derived extracellular
vesicles (TEV) in melanoma (MEL) and neuroblastoma (NB). Recently published1 and preliminary data revealed
that TEV are primarily, but not exclusively, captured by macrophages (MF) in metastasis-tropic organs prior to
their colonization by tumor cells, and that they trigger an inflammatory reaction in MF that includes the production
of interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1β and activation of the inflammasome. We also found that TEV-capturing cells in
the PMN are heterogenous, including MF and non-MF cells, with the contribution of non-MF cells, including
myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSC), increasing as the PMN evolves toward a metastatic niche (MN).
Using newly murine models of orthotopic metastasis to track endogenously released TEV and their capture in
the PMN developed in our laboratory, state of the art single cell analysis methods, and a unique collection of
patient samples, we will test the hypothesis that TEV capture by resident MF in the PMN triggers via the
inflammasome the release of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, which signal for the recruitment of
bone marrow -derived myeloid cells (BMDMC) and MDSC to the PMN, supporting the subsequent
colonization of the PMN by metastatic tumor cells. In AIM 1, we will perform spatiotemporal analysis of the
PMN formation and its evolution into MN, identifying at the single cell level subpopulations of TEV-capturing cells
defined by their RNA and protein expression. We will use pharmacological and loss-of-function approaches
targeting the activation of the inflammasome in the PMN to determine whether the development of the PMN is
disrupted and metastatic colonization inhibited. In AIM 2, we will perform kinetics analysis of the colonization of
the PMN by BMDMC. We will determine whether TEV-capturing MF send signal(s) that promote the
differentiation of BMDMC into MDSC through the release of IL-1β and IL-18 or other cytokines. We will
demonstrate the role of IL-18 and IL-1β on PMN formation and metastatic colonization using pharmacological
inhibition of IL-18 or mice deficient in IL-1β or IL-18. In AIM 3, we will use a unique collection of retrospective
and prospective liver tissues from children with NB to characterize by Imaging Mass Cytometry the PMN in
human samples, comparing the results with those from murine models. We expect to identify mechanisms
involved in the formation of the PMN and MN, providing a strong premise for development of intervention
approaches that could prevent the initiation of metastasis. Considering the current absence of therapeutic agents
preventing metastasis, the project, if successful, could have a significant impact for MEL, NB, and other cancers."
10982416,"Patients with life-threatening hematologic cancer experience insomnia and fatigue, distress, and pain symptoms
that worsen insomnia during and following hospitalization for high-dose chemotherapy. Despite an urgent need,
there are limited symptom management protocols that comprehensively target the challenging treatment (i.e.,
inpatient, outpatient) and symptom demands faced by hematologic cancer patients. We developed and tested a
6-session, therapist-led, telehealth intervention for hematologic cancer patients following discharge from
inpatient treatment (Nite2Day). Nite2Day teaches mindfulness meditations and behavioral strategies to improve
insomnia and related fatigue, distress, and pain symptoms. Nite2Day demonstrated strong feasibility,
acceptability, and significant improvements to primary (insomnia; d=1.20) and secondary outcomes (fatigue,
distress, mindfulness; ds=.38-.89). Nite2Day does not address the inpatient setting where patients describe
sleep quality as especially poor. This pilot randomized controlled trial will extend Nite2Day to the inpatient setting
(Nite2Day+) and assess its feasibility, acceptability, engagement, and outcome patterns. Hematologic cancer
patients (N=60) reporting insomnia symptoms during hospitalization will be randomized (1:1) to Nite2Day+ or
Usual Care. Nite2Day+ will be delivered via a self-paced mobile app in the hospital and include: 1) mindfulness
meditations promoting acceptance of the challenging inpatient setting; 2) brief videos on sleep education (e.g.,
sleep drive, circadian rhythm) and behavioral strategies to improve inpatient sleep quality (e.g., stimulus control,
daytime activity); and 3) tools to manage inpatient sleep disruptions (e.g., sleep mask, ear plugs). Once
discharged home, patients will transition to the previously tested, 6-session protocol. We hypothesize that: 1)
Nite2Day+ will be feasible (accrual N=60/24 months; <25% attrition; >75% adherence to assessments and
intervention), acceptable (M>3/5 satisfaction with procedures; M>3/4 satisfaction with Nite2Day+), and engaging
(Nite2Day+ app log-in, video/skills practice >2x/week); and 2) Nite2Day+ will improve insomnia symptom severity
(primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (fatigue, distress, pain, pre-sleep arousal, mindfulness, symptom
management self-efficacy) from baseline to hospital discharge and after the 6-session protocol, compared to
Usual Care. Dr. Fisher will receive advanced training and expert mentorship in behavioral sleep and cancer
symptom management and behavioral intervention development for inpatient and outpatient settings, and
randomized trial designs and statistical methods for optimizing behavioral treatment regimens to improve the
transition from inpatient to outpatient settings. This training will help Dr. Fisher pursue a future sequential multiple
assignment randomized trial assessing insomnia and symptom management strategies that are responsive to
challenging treatment (i.e., inpatient, outpatient) and heterogeneous symptom demands faced by hematologic
cancer patients. Findings could inform adaptation of other psychosocial interventions for the inpatient setting,
and establish a new model of systematic symptom management for various cancer and hospitalized populations."

Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI of the lung with polarized gases is capable of providing valuable regional information
about ventilation and gas exchange that is unobtainable using other imaging modalities. However, current HP
129Xe MRI is limited by the fact that imaging takes place during a non-physiological breath-hold. In this project,
we propose to develop a technique to dynamically image the lung using 129Xe MRI during free-breathing; in
addition to enabling a more physiologically relevant assessment of lung function, this method will be feasible in
patient populations that have thus far been inaccessible to 129Xe MR imaging due to poor breath-hold tolerance:
young children, end-stage lung disease, etc.
To enable the repeatable lung function measurements during free-breathing, we will construct and optimize a
system to automatically deliver a small fixed volume (~50 ml, proportionally delivered based on inhaled gas flow)
of 129Xe at a constant rate with each breath, via a small tube connected to a sealed facemask worn by the subject.
This set-up will allow us to implement a breathing / imaging protocol that requires no subject effort or training,
and is therefore more compatible with widespread clinical implementation. Using a novel 3D spiral acquisition
designed to optimize signal, navigator fidelity, and resolution of spectral components, we will acquire a number
of novel imaging parameters capable of assessing specific lung regions' dynamical behavior over the course of
a breathing cycle. Finally, we will establish the reproducibility and sensitivity of these markers to early smoking-
induced changes in lung function via imaging in both healthy subjects and at-risk smokers.
While the studies proposed in this project focus on assessing functional alterations indicative of early COPD, the
dynamic imaging technique we propose to develop has several other potential clinical applications. Most notably,
these include conditions (e.g., unexplained dyspnea, long COVID) in which the aspect of lung function limiting
gas exchange is unknown, and clinical syndromes (like COPD) in which disparate pathophysiology requires an
assessment tool with broad sensitivity to identify and classify functional change in early disease."

Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease that occurs worldwide with ineffective anti-parasite drugs and
no vaccine. The disease severity is often due to an exaggerated immune response rather than uncontrolled
parasite replication. Our goal is to define the mechanisms promoting immunopathology in the disease in
order to develop new host-directed therapies. Our new data shows that the skin microbiome contributes to
the development of more severe disease in patients and experimental models. Qualitative and quantitative
changes in the bacteria present in leishmanial lesions, and high levels of Staphylococcus aureus, were
associated with delayed healing. Similarly, bacterial colonization of mice infected with Leishmania leads to
more severe disease without altering the parasite burden. Thus, our results indicate that disease outcome is
profoundly affected by the host response and the skin microbiome. We cultured S. aureus isolates from
patients and we will test the hypothesis that S. aureus promotes increased disease in a strain-specific
manner. Building on preliminary data that strain-level variation in S. aureus underlies differential
immunopathology in cutaneous leishmaniasis, we will use a comparative genomics approach combined with
host-directed phenotyping to identify S. aureus virulence factors that promote disease. We also found that
L. braziliensis patients had variable numbers of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in their lesions and that low
numbers of Tregs were associated with delayed healing. We recapitulated those findings in a mouse model,
showing that mice with low numbers of Tregs colonized with S. aureus and infected with L. braziliensis
develop severe disease with high levels of IFN-γ and S. aureus. We will use our murine models and in vitro
skin organoids to define the mechanisms leading to severe immunopathologic responses. The studies
defining qualitative differences in S. aureus and the immunopathologic responses associated with S. aureus
colonization will be used to identify potential targets for microbial- and host-directed therapies. Pentavalent
antimony is the standard of care for CL in Brazil, but it is often ineffective. Our findings strongly support the
concomitant use of host-directed therapies to improve outcomes. However, to ensure that such therapies do
not lead to an increase in S. aureus burden, we aim to develop therapies that limit host immunopathologic
responses while limiting S. aureus burden and virulence. To accomplish this, we will test a combination of
host-directed therapies with a consortium of skin commensal bacteria that directly inhibit S. aureus, and in
an alternative approach, test a pan-caspase inhibitor that blocks cell death but also controls S. aureus.
Together, these studies will uncover how S. aureus worsens disease caused by Leishmania, information
vital for developing new leishmaniasis treatments, and will also define how S. aureus, a major cause of skin
and soft tissue infections, promotes inflammatory diseases when there is a deficit in regulatory T cells."

Mutations in chromatin regulators have emerged as a major cause of Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as
autism spectrum disorders, schizophrenia, and intellectual disabilities. Following the gene discoveries, many
mouse models and human cells resembling these genetic lesions have been made and characterized. These
chromatin-linked Neurodevelopmental disorders models often display misregulation of genes with relevant
brain functions, including synaptic plasticity. Most work has focused on such brain-associated genes to explain
the cellular and behavioral phenotypes. An underappreciated observation is that several Neurodevelopmental
disorders models display ectopic expression of germline genes, which should only be expressed in the testis or
ovary. No o work thus far has addressed the causal impact of mis-expressed genes on cellular- and behavioral
traits. The lack of knowledge prevents us from understanding the mechanisms underlying Neurodevelopmental
disorders. If germline gene expression causally impacts neurodevelopment, it would be an ideal drug target
because such drugs would not directly interfere with any brain molecules.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to address the question—Does ectopic germline gene expression
contribute to Neurodevelopmental disorders? Our focus is lysine demethylase 5c (KDM5C), whose loss of
function is responsible for a syndromic Neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability,
autistic features, and aggressive behavior. As the name suggests, KDM5C reverses H3K4 methylation
(H3K4me), a hallmark of transcriptionally-engaged chromatin, and the modification is conserved from yeast to
humans. Kdm5c-knockout (KO) mouse model recapitulates the key features of the above behavior seen in
human patients. In addition, our unbiased survey of gene misregulation with RNA-seq revealed that the top
altered genes were germline-specific genes, derepressed in Kdm5c-KO brain tissues. Furthermore, Stra8 and
Dazl, master key genes for germline development, are present in Kdm5c-KO stem cells. These data indicate
that Kdm5c deletion led to the soma-to-germline transformation to some extent. The proposed study will test
the hypothesis—germline gene expression bestows ‘germcellness’ to the mutant brain and contributes to
neurological complications of Kdm5c-KO mice.
The proposed study addresses the impact of non-brain genes in Neurodevelopmental disorders models for the
first time. Transcriptional silencing of germline genes in somatic cells is proposed to be an essential step for
multicellularity, which emerged 1.5 billion years ago. Thus, the proposed study may reveal a deep evolutionary
root of several Neurodevelopmental disorders, that can be targeted in future therapeutics."
10985467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, nearly 808,000 U.S. patients had end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and the majority underwent
hemodialysis (HD) using arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). AVFs have ~62% 1-year patency due to venous neointimal
hyperplasia (VNH) and venous stenosis (VS). The molecular mechanisms of VS/VNH after AVF are not understood.
We completed a randomized, blinded phase 1 clinical trial where 21 patients (5 females, average 65 yo) underwent
periadventitial delivery of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC, n=10) or placebo to the outflow
vein at new upper extremity AVF creation. The primary endpoint was time to AVF maturation. It was significantly
decreased in MSC treated patients versus controls (1.5 vs 2.5 m respectively, Log Rank: P<0.05). Several MSC-
treated patients had AVFs with added procedures to maintain patency (‘non-responder MSCs’). Murine xenografts
using human MSCs (hMSCs) from responders had PPARg reduction in CD68 (+) cells and this is protective for
VS/VNH formation. Senescence alters cellular function leading to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines
known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). MSCs are anti-inflammatory and reduce VS/VNH by
decreasing many of the SASP cytokines. MSCs isolated from patients with chronic kidney disease are senescent. We
hypothesized that senescence is responsible for the dysfunction of MSCs from non-responders, obtunding the ability
of MSCs to reduce inflammatory cues responsible for VS/VNH. Studies show senolytic drugs such as Dasatinib and
Quercetin (D&Q) can decrease the senescent burden in cells and organs leading to improved function. So, we treated
hMSCs from responder and non-responder with D&Q (D&Q hMSCs) and found it decreased Sensig scores (senescent
gene expression) and increased proliferation. In vitro studies showed conditioned media (CM) from MSCs reduced
PMA induced THP-1 (monocyte) cell differentiation with an increase in pSTAT3 with a decrease in PPARg expression.
Next, D&Q hMSC xenografts in mice with AVFs were created and there was a decrease in Pparg gene expression,
Fridman_Up (fibrosis gene), and Sensig scores accompanied with a reduction in inflammatory, SMCs, fibrosis, with
increased endothelial cells (ECs), and less VS/VNH. Our central hypothesis is that arteriovenous fistulas treated with
D&Q MSCs increase pSTAT3 and decrease PPARg in resident monocytes/ MΦs of AVFs leading to less pro-
inflammatory cells resulting in positive vascular remodeling, less fibrosis, Sensig, Fridman-Up scores, and increased
endothelization There are three specific aims:
Aim 1. Investigate the role of CM from D&Q hMSCs from non-responders and responders on monocyte to
macrophage differentiation, activation, pSTAT3/ PPARG signaling, functional changes, and Sensig score.
Aim 2. Determine the effect of D&Q hMSC on pSTAT3/ PPARg signaling and VS/VNH formation in murine AVFs.
Aim 3. Assess the efficacy of D&Q MSC in retarding VS/VNH in a pig AVF model."
10990122,"Cells within the tissue microenvironment sense, process and respond to mechanical cues from their
environment. This mechanosensing is essential for tissue homeostasis, and its dysregulation drives tumor
development, growth, and metastasis. Therefore, characterizing its mechanobiology – the interplay between
mechanical cell-microenvironment interaction and cell signaling – can play an important role in helping (a) cancer
biologists gain mechanistic insights for developing improved drug treatments for cancer; and (b) provide
pathologists and clinicians the ability to help develop improved markers for predicting risk of cancer development
and relapse, its metastatic potential, and response to therapy in individual patients. However, despite its
importance in both preclinical and clinical settings no computational methods currently exist to readily incorporate
mechanobiological properties of tissue microenvironments in cancer research and its translation. To overcome
this gap in our knowledge, we aim to develop a novel algorithm that combines high-resolution Hematoxylin and
Eosin (H&E) digital pathology (DP) imaging and highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (HxIF) microscopy with
physical optics-based principles of light-matter interaction to characterize mechanobiology properties of three-
dimensional tumor microenvironments (TME) across whole slide tissue sections at sub-cellular resolution. In our
published work we have shown that light-matter interaction can capture structural alterations with nanoscale
sensitivity within the specimen. Here, we hypothesize that computationally implementing this principle on tumor
microenvironments imaged using DP and HxIF microscopy can quantitatively capture intrinsic
mechanobiological properties of the cellular and acellular components of the microenvironment that go beyond
image analysis and machine learning based feature extraction. Combining this computational imaging method
with information theoretic principles we also aim to provide researchers with the ability to quantify the major
cellular interactions driving these mechanical properties. We note that in many scenarios – for example, in
pathology – it is not possible to access tissue samples at a temporal resolution that faithfully captures the
complexity of an evolving tumor. Therefore, the ability of our method to capture interaction from a single tissue
microenvironment will be very valuable for pathologists to better predict future outcomes. It will also be very
useful for cancer and developmental biologists using animal models and organoids to study mechanisms driving
cell fate decisions. We aim to develop our algorithm with successful completion of two aims. (1) Computational
imaging algorithm for mechanobiological characterization of 3D microenvironment. (2) Information theory-based
algorithm for characterizing directed mechanobiological interactions. By providing mechanobiological
characterization of TMEs for the first time, our methods will have multifactorial impact on understanding the
spatial systems biology of TMEs from development of new mechanobiology based diagnostic, prognostic, and
surveillance biomarkers to new targets for overcoming mechanobiology mediated patient resistance to therapy."

Long-read sequencing is rapidly transforming our knowledge of the human genome as well as the approach to
uncovering human genetic variation and alterations. In contrast to the rapid pace of algorithmic innovations for
long-read sequencing of human genomes, both the informatic development and the generation of long-read
cancer genome data have seen lagging. With the accuracy and cost of long-read sequencing both approaching
short reads, we anticipate long-read cancer genome sequencing to soon become the new frontier of cancer
genomics and the primary engine of cancer genomic discoveries. The overarching goal of this application is to
catalyze long-read cancer genome sequencing efforts through the development of informatic methods for the
discovery and characterization of somatic genetic alterations in cancer genomes. We propose three lines of
research activities to achieve this goal. First, we will improve existing methods for long-read analysis, including
both long-read alignment and assembly, and develop downstream bioinformatic tools for somatic variant
discovery from aligned long reads (Aim 1) and from de novo long-read assembly (Aim 2). Second, in parallel to
the informatic development, we will generate a resource of long-read cancer genome data that are used for the
benchmarking and evaluation of long-read informatic methods (Aim 3). We will specifically compare the
performance of variant detection from alignment-based and assembly-based approaches to generate best
practices for long-read cancer genome applications. Finally, we aim to build and expand an active community of
researchers who interact with, generate, analyze, or develop informatic methods for long-read cancer genome
data (Aim 4). The community building effort will initially focus on providing tutorials and user examples based on
the newly developed informatic methods and newly generated long-read data, and eventually aim to establish a
catalog of reference cancer genome assemblies for use by the cancer research community."
10976019,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sleep is normally a period of biological rest and recuperation for the cardiovascular system. Inadequate or low-
quality sleep is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increasing evidence also suggests
that cardiac aging is an important hallmark of CVD. Traditional sleep assessment is based on questionaries
that are known to suffer from limited resolution and existing biases. In addition, sleep quality is typically
measured at a single examination, which limits its capability to assess the impact of changes in sleep patterns
on cardiac health. Recent advances in digital technologies provide a promising solution to assess the impact of
sleep pathology on cardiac health longitudinally. We hypothesize that impaired sleep quality and sleep apnea
accelerate cardiac electrophysiological aging and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. We will leverage
a rare longitudinal collection of objective sleep measures and cardiovascular health in the Korean Genome and
Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Our study will include ~2800 participants who have 3 cycles of overnight
polysomnography starting in 2011 and 4th cycle to be completed by 2025. Two specific aims will be pursued. In
Aim 1, we will assess the association of sleep apnea on aging cross-sectionally and longitudinally over 12
years. In Aim 2, we will determine if specific sleep and sleep apnea endotypes are associated with accelerated
cardiac aging. This investigation will provide critical knowledge to better understand the impact of sleep on
cardiac aging and cardiac health. Our long-term goal is to use sleep-targeted treatment as a way to preserve
cardiac function, preventing the inevitable deterioration with aging."

Older patients with carotid artery atherosclerotic disease are at risk of stroke, and some evidence suggests
that people are affected by their carotid artery stenosis even in the absence of a stroke. These non-stroke
outcomes are poorly studied, but may include cognitive decline, sleep disturbances, and mood abnormalities.
Whether medication or surgery for carotid artery stenosis improves these non-stroke symptoms is unclear.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the best way to measure these non-stroke patient-reported outcomes to
be able to study how carotid artery stenosis treatment affects these symptoms. A reliable and accurate
measurement of patient-reported outcomes in carotid artery stenosis will enable identification and tracking of
these symptoms throughout the treatment continuum.
Research Aim 1 of this project will use instruments developed by the National Institutes of Health to measure
quality-of-life and function across diseases, as well as a robust, multidimensional assessment of cognition (NIH
Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; NIH Toolbox-Cognitive Battery). These will be
collected on people with a diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis, including those with prior medical or surgical
treatment, and newly diagnosed carotid artery disease requiring surgery. Patients will have at least two
timepoints 6 months apart, with more frequent assessments directly after surgery in patients undergoing
surgery during this study period.
Research Aim 2 of this project will use interviews and focus groups to gain patient and caregiver perspectives
about non-stroke changes that may have occurred after revascularization for carotid artery stenosis. This data
will help select the best measures of non-stroke outcomes for carotid artery stenosis to be used in large scale
trials evaluating which treatment is best for which patients.
For older patients with carotid artery disease, this research will ensure better alignment of treatment with the
4M Geriatric Framework of Age-Friendly Health Systems. With this lens, we will better understand how to align
treatment of carotid artery stenosis with 1) what matters most to patients, 2) how medication treatment effects
older patients, 3) how treatment can improve mentation, and 4) how to promote mobility and independence in
this complex patient population."

plus immune checkpoint inhibition. Dr. Eng has been a contributing member to ECOG-ACRIN and SWOG since
2006, serving in multiple leadership roles for the NCTN including lead PI of the NCTN Lead Academic
Participating Site (LAPS) grant while at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Following her transition to Vanderbilt, she
continued to serve as the institutional SWOG PI and Vice-Chair of the SWOG GI Committee. In 2021, she was
nominated by her peers to serve as the co-Chair of the NCI Gastrointestinal Steering Committee. In this role,
she provides insight and oversight of all NCTN phase II/III GI concepts in development. She is also co-leading a
new working group that is focused on incorporating circulating tumor DNA biomarker studies in future NCTN
trials. For continuity of high- quality clinical research, it is imperative that successful Clinician Scientists mentor
early career faculty. Dr. Eng has served as a mentor for several NCTN mentees include Drs. Van Morris, Jennifer
Dorth, Anwaar Saeed, Rajiv Agarwal, and Kristen Ciombor all impactful contributors to NCI-sponsored clinical
research. In her new role for the cancer center, Dr. Eng is now the Director for Strategic Relations which allows
her to interact regularly with multidisciplinary leadership institution-wide with an overarching shared objective of
increasing clinical trial engagement and enrolment with a critical component being NCI-sponsored clinical efforts
given the association with her current role as NCI GI Steering Committee Co-Chair, institutional SWOG PI, and
the impact on the UM1, LAPS UG1 and the CCSG. The R50 grant affords the ability of Dr. Eng to continue to
participate and expand on NCI-sponsored clinical trials research efforts through development of novel trials with
early and mid-career faculty, executive administration, and leadership roles both internally at Vanderbilt, within
the NCTN Network and the NCI to help guide the next generation of Clinician Scientists so that they may also
develop into successful contributors to their own institutions and at the national level for all NCI-sponsored clinical
cancer research."

Human coronavirus (hCoV) induces excessive inflammation and impairs interferon (IFN) responses, often
referred to as 'dysregulated immunity,' which is associated with fatal pneumonia. However, the specific virus
and host factors that cause dysregulated lung immunity and lethal pneumonia are not well defined, constituting
a significant knowledge gap. Our work in mouse models of hCoVs has shown that impaired or delayed IFN-I
and excessive myeloid cell responses cause excessive lung inflammation, acute lung injury, and fatal
pneumonia. Notably, myeloid cell depletion reduces lung inflammation and pathology and improved survival.
However, the key host factors that drive hCoV-induced acute lung injury and pathology are not well understood.
RNA viruses such as hCoVs elicit myeloid cell inflammation primarily through TLR/TRAF6/NF-kB or MAPK
activation. Of note, TRAF6 is a common adapter molecule upstream of both NF-kB and MAPK. Therefore,
TRAF6 is an attractive target to moderate hCoV-induced excessive lung inflammation without disturbing the
antiviral TRAF3/IRF/IFN pathway. Here, we show that TRAF6 is central to myeloid cell-mediated inflammatory
response, and the abrogation of TRAF6 activity significantly reduces hCoV-induced inflammatory cytokine
production. Remarkably, TRAF6 inhibition enhances antiviral IFN-I response in macrophages. Based on our
published and preliminary data, we hypothesize that myeloid cell intrinsic TRAF6 activity promotes excessive
lung inflammation, suppresses antiviral immunity, causing lung pathology. The primary objective of the
proposed exploratory grant application is to define the critical role of myeloid-cell TRAF6 signaling in SARS-
CoV-2-induced dysregulated immunity, acute lung injury, and lung pathology. We will also define the
mechanistic basis for TRAF6-mediated dysregulated immunity during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Establishing the
central role of TRAF6 signaling in dysregulated immunity will allow us to evaluate novel therapeutics targeting
TRAF6 activity to suppress excessive lung inflammation while enhancing antiviral immunity."
10999623,"ABSTRACT: Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes (T2D), is associated with hyperglycemia (Hg) and obesity
(Ob). Hg/Ob is associated with greater severity of disease and mortality in respiratory viral infections, such as
SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza. Hg/Ob exaggerates damaging inflammation and dampens anti-viral responses. To
address underlying mechanisms, we and others have established mouse models and report that in mice infected
with SARS-CoV-2, antecedent Hg/Ob: (1) reduces survival; and (2) increases inflammatory cytokines, TNF-
alpha, IL-alpha, IL-beta, and IL-9, all factors which recapitulate human disease. Our key preliminary data reveal
that in Hg/Ob, depletion of lung resident alveolar macrophages (AMs) significantly improves survival in SARS-
CoV-2 infection; in contrast, in lean mice, depletion of AMs causes significant mortality. These considerations
indicate that Hg/Ob significantly reprograms AMs to cause them to become highly proinflammatory, with
markedly reduced resolution potential. Strikingly, pre-infection, the lungs of mice and humans with Hg/Ob contain
an extensive network of adipose tissue and crown like structures, macrophages, including AMs. Hg/Ob augments
recruitment and invasion of immune cells, inflammation, and oxidative stress, thereby creating an environment
for deleterious responses to SARS-CoV-2. Hg/Ob mediates trained immunity; in mouse models, transplantation
of bone marrow from animals with T2D/Ob into control recipient mice amplifies atherosclerosis and
neuroinflammatory consequences, respectively, even after correction of Hg/Ob. In this Multi-PI application, Drs.
Kamal Khanna (expert in immunology, host responses to viruses and lung macrophages) and Ann Marie
Schmidt (expert in diabetes, obesity and metabolism), have worked together to develop the supporting data to
pursue the hypothesis that antecedent Hg/Ob reprograms pulmonary and extra-pulmonary immune responses,
thereby triggering loss of homeostatic immune cell-intrinsic and cell-cell crosstalk, and imbuing gain-of-toxic
function and deleterious loss-of-protective function in AM lung macrophages and in bone marrow myeloid
precursors; consequences of which include exacerbated and sustained tissue-damaging inflammation and
dampened resolution in respiratory viral infections. We predict that these consequences of Hb/Ob in
macrophages are mediated, at least in part, through striking upregulation of PLA2G7 in Hg/Ob AMs.
Our two laboratories, together with key collaborative support of Dr. VD Dixit (Yale), an expert in PLA2G7, will
employ state-of-the-art novel mouse models, bone marrow transplantation techniques, RNA/ATAC sequencing
and spatial transcriptomics, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry including novel methodologies to track
immune cell metabolism and other methods in mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, MA-10 or PR8
(influenza). The significance and impact of this work is very high. As the epidemics of T2D and obesity
continue to soar, it is essential to identify new therapeutic targets in superimposed respiratory viral infections."

Currently, there is no cure for intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) paucity except for liver transplantation. IHBD paucity
causes accumulation of pathologic bile within the liver resulting in bile stasis and over time can lead to chronic
cholestasis. Diseases such as Alagille syndrome (ALGS), biliary atresia, progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis are
associated with IHBD paucity. The standard of care for some of these diseases includes reducing bile acids
through surgical biliary diversion, inhibition of the ileal bile acid transporter (i.e., IBAT) or by altering the
composition of the bile acid pool (using bile acids salts or FXR ligand agonists) to interrupt and modify
enterohepatic circulation. Currently, there are no clinical approaches to augment IHBD architecture or bile duct
number in patients with these diseases. Therefore, in the absence of new approaches, patients with IHBD paucity
will remain dependent on liver transplantation as definitive therapy for the foreseeable future.
We have published that hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte transdifferentiation in the absence of epithelial Notch
activity is competent through a Tgfbr2-dependent mechanism. However, hepatocyte-to-cholangiocyte
transdifferentiation is inefficient in patients with ALGS, due to global JAGGED1 (JAG1) haploinsufficiency with a
significant number of patients requiring liver transplantation. Recent lineage tracing and single-cell RNA
sequencing studies inform us that even though arising from a common mesenchymal progenitor, the identity of
periportal mesenchyme is divergent from hepatic stellate cells and a critical knowledge gap in all aspects of
IHBD development. Preliminary work strongly supports a role for periportal mesenchyme in this process, but the
underlying role of periportal mesenchyme in IHBD paucity is superficial at best, especially regarding the
mechanisms regulating biliary epithelial-periportal mesenchymal crosstalk. Our long-term goal is to understand
the mechanisms regulating epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk during IHBD specification, morphogenesis,
maintenance, and response to injury/disease. Based on published and unpublished results we propose to
address the central hypothesis that Jag1 haploinsufficiency impacts the periportal mesenchyme indirectly by
reducing Notch activity in the hepatic epithelium hindering the implementation of the full cholangiocyte
transcriptional program and thereby influencing the periportal mesenchyme by disrupting optimum crosstalk
between the epithelium and mesenchyme. Our aims are to: 1) define the role Gli1 periportal mesenchyme plays
to regulate epithelial IHBD development, and 2) define the role epithelial Ihh plays to regulate epithelial-periportal
mesenchymal crosstalk. Long-term, the improved understanding of epithelial-periportal mesenchymal crosstalk
will enable the development of targeted therapies capable of altering and augmenting IHBD disease."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 14 million Americans by 2050. To
date, though, research on the signs and symptoms of ADRD has been sparse in early midlife populations,
especially at the national level. It is crucial to conduct such research because early changes in cognitive
functioning and the accumulation of risk factors for ADRD can begin decades before concrete signs and
symptoms emerge. The challenging search for the causes of ADRD has made it clear that prospective and
comprehensive data—including detailed social, biological, and health measurements across the life course—
are needed to identify key predictors of ADRD. As such, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health) provides an extraordinary opportunity to study the early origins of cognitive
functioning/change and ADRD risk in a nationally representative cohort that has been followed since
adolescence and will be in their mid-40s in the next wave of data collection (Wave VI). The overall goal of this
project is to collect and disseminate critical data related to cognitive, physical, and sensory functioning in
conjunction with the Add Health Wave VI Core Project to facilitate identification of early risk factors for later life
ADRD. Adding such rich measures to Wave VI of Add Health will make possible tracking of cognitive, sensory,
and physical functioning across the life course; coupled with the testing of biological risk markers, it will also lay
the foundation for detecting signs of cognitive impairment and ADRD risk in early midlife. These new data,
when combined with Add Health’s existing 25-year collection of extraordinarily rich multi-level and longitudinal
measures and its new Wave VI data, will also aid in the scientific community’s understanding of the interplay of
social, behavioral, and biological factors leading to ADRD in later life. Moreover, because Add Health is a very
diverse sample, adding these data to Wave VI will greatly increase understanding of cognitive, physical, and
sensory functioning within health disparity populations. The project’s specific aims are to: 1) Collect new in-
depth, in-person assessments of cognitive functioning in early midlife for a nationally representative and
racially/ethnically diverse subsample of participants in Wave VI; 2) Collect automated, (largely) web-based
measures of cognition in early midlife for all participants in Wave VI and compare them with our in-person
measures of cognition to assess their feasibility and value; 3) Include assessments of physical and sensory
functioning in early midlife for Wave VI participants of Add Health; 4) Test for biological markers of ADRD risk
and cognitive function in early midlife; 5) Clean, document, disseminate, promote, and support the data
collected in this project for the scientific community."
10993748,"ABSTRACT
Mechanical forces are often modulated in diseased or wounded tissues as a result of inflammatory responses
driven by immune cell activity in the affected site(s). In fact, aberrant mechanical force generation in pathological
settings may mediate disease progression and treatment resistance. However, little is known about the response
of immune cells to these mechanical forces, particularly at the tissue-length scale, and even in normal
physiological settings. Thus there is a critically unmet need to fill overlooked gaps in our basic understanding of
the interplay between tissue-level mechanical forces and immune cell behavior, both collectively and at the
single-cell level. With the support of the NIGMS R35 MIRA for Early Stage Investigators over the next five years,
my laboratory will establish the first immune mechanome. We will investigate the impact of tissue mechanical
forces on the phenotype and function of innate and adaptive immune cells in a variety of organs. Leveraging
engineering-based tools and approaches, we will couple unbiased omics platforms to mechanical testing at
multiple scales (e.g., on cells in vivo, tissues ex vivo, and organs in vivo) in order to relate immune response to
mechanical forces. During multiscale compression, the trafficking, distribution, motility, cell-cell interactions, and
functional behavior of immune cells will be examined and perturbed via: i) intravital and dynamic imaging (e.g.,
with multiphoton microscopy of fluorescent cells or genetically engineered mouse models); ii) immunocompetent,
transgenic, and immunogenic animal models (e.g., OT-I/OT-II antigen systems); and iii) artificial intelligence-
based cell state analysis (e.g., from single cell RNA sequencing). We will also explore our hypothesis that
beneficial immune activity in the face of pathological conditions is suppressed by heightened tissue mechanical
forces. Importantly, the proposed Projects are to be performed in non-specific contexts that are independent of
tissue type, organ, or disease in order to maximize the potential for broad impact in the biomedical sciences.
The knowledge generated will lay the groundwork for future mechanistic and translational research in both
healthy and diseased settings. By operating at the interface of mechanical engineering and immunology in the
burgeoning field of “mechano-immunology,” my research program is uniquely suited to reveal new biophysical
insights and pathophysiological targets for human disease."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common inherited disorder that leads to kidney
failure. The only approved treatment to decelerate kidney disease progression in patients with ADPKD is
tolvaptan, but its usage is limited due to frequent side effects affecting adherence. Thus, alternative
interventions that may slow ADPKD progression hold considerable clinical importance. In line with the general
population, body-mass index and insulin resistance have been increasing in patients with ADPKD. We have
shown that visceral adiposity associates strongly with accelerated progression of early-stage ADPKD. Our
R03-funded pilot study suggested that diet-induced weight loss may slow kidney growth (% in height-adjusted
total kidney volume [htTKV] by magnetic resonance imaging), and we are currently evaluating the efficacy of
daily caloric restriction-induced weight loss for slowing ADPKD progression in a phase IIa clinical trial.
However, the long-term adherence to lifestyle interventions is challenging, making pharmacological
interventions a compelling adjunct or alternative. Moreover, our recently completed R21-funded study
demonstrated that adults with ADPKD and preserved kidney function exhibited insulin resistance (via the gold-
standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps) and impaired kidney oxidative metabolism (via 11C-acetate
PET), which were strongly associated with htTKV. These novel data suggest that targeting improvements in
insulin sensitivity and kidney oxidative metabolism, in addition to weight loss, may slow ADPKD progression.
Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) were recently FDA-approved for the treatment of
obesity and show promise in substantially reducing adiposity and improving insulin sensitivity. Additionally,
evidence indicates that GLP-1RAs may transform CKD management by reducing nephropathy events in
patients with and without diabetes, via effects extending beyond glycemic modulation, and in part via
attenuated kidney inflammation and oxidative stress. However, GLP-1RAs have not yet been evaluated as a
novel therapy for slowing ADPKD progression in patients with overweight/obesity. Thus, we propose a 24-
month, phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial using a GLP-1RA in 126 adults with
ADPKD and overweight or obesity to slow kidney growth (primary outcome). As a novel therapeutic in ADPKD,
GLP-1RAs could transform the treatment landscape for patients.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the effect of 24 months of GLP-1RA vs. placebo on kidney growth in adults with
ADPKD and overweight/obesity.
Specific Aim 2: Define changes in total body weight, adipose volume and function, insulin resistance, kidney
oxidative metabolism, and inflammation after 24 months of GLP-1RA vs. placebo in adults.
Specific Aim 3: Establish the safety and tolerability of GLP-1RA in adults with ADPKD and overweight/obesity."
10993749,"ABSTRACT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
The purpose of this R01 proposal is to deepen our knowledge of the primary cause of drug overdose deaths in
the U.S. today: novel psychoactive synthetic opioids, the majority of which are fentanyl analogues. Using a
nationwide registry of patients who present to emergency departments, novel fentanyl analogue overdose will
be studied in terms of its epidemiology, analytical confirmation, clinical risk factors, and treatment needs, by a
uniquely qualified multidisciplinary team with an extensive track record of collaboration in the field.
The scope of the U.S. opioid epidemic is broadening, with drug overdose deaths nearly tripling from 1999-
2015. For the first time ever, in 2015 U.S. drug overdose deaths surpassed 50,000 (52,404), of which 33,091
(63.1%) involved an opioid. Overdose deaths continued to increase in 2016 to 63,600. Opioid overdoses cost
Americans $504 billion in 2015 (2.8% of gross domestic product), up from six times the prior estimates in 2013.
There was a 27% increase in nationwide Emergency Department visits for opioid overdoses last year alone.
Strategies to mitigate this trend by decreasing the availability and abuse potential of prescription opioids have
been followed by an increase in illicit opioid use. While initially the predominance of illicit opioid overdoses
were a result of heroin exposure, the changing face of global drug commerce introduced synthetic opioid
fentanyl analogues into the drug supply, where they are now estimated to have surpassed heroin as the
primary cause of drug overdose deaths.
Using nearly 70 hospital centers nationwide with bedside evaluation of patients, over 10,000 overdose patients
have been enrolled in the Principal Investigator’s prior study giving this proposal momentum and feasibility.
Our specific aims are four-fold: (1) state-of-the-art toxicology analytics, as well as biomarkers of clinical
severity; (2) treatment requirements such as naloxone, need for critical care and/or mechanical ventilation; and
(3) regional and temporal trends nationwide to be shared via the CDC website for nonfatal drug overdose.
To achieve these Specific Aims, we will increase enrollment of an ongoing, national sample of patients. We will
implement the rapid dissemination of alerts and information to the public and public health entities on adverse
effects of fentanyl analogues. At the completion of the proposed research, the knowledge of emerging
substances will be significantly advanced to the benefit of thousands of victims of the U.S. opioid epidemic."

Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and Hispanic/Latino (H/L) women with breast cancer have elevated mortality
rates relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) women with breast cancer. This is, in part, due to the detection of
breast tumors at higher stages, and because of higher rates of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly
aggressive breast cancer subtype associated with poor prognosis because of the lack of Estrogen (E),
Progesterone (P), and Her2 receptors. The prevalence of African ancestry in the genome of H/L from the
Caribbean (C-H/L) and NHB may contribute to elevated mortality rates because of higher rates of TNBC in
C-H/L and NHB relative to H/L and NHW women. Therefore, there is a need to identify novel biological
therapies specific to women of African heritage with TNBC. TTK and Nek2 are among sixteen kinases that
distinguish poor-prognosis basal/TNBC from better prognosis Luminal subtypes and can identify a
population of Luminal breast cancer patients with poor prognosis. The PI recently published that TTK and
Nek2 mRNAs are significantly overexpressed in breast cancers of NHB women. This is the first report that
finds dysregulated mitotic kinases in breast tumors of women from different races and ethnicities. The team
has also demonstrated that TTK and Nek2 can signal early stages of metastasis (the epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition, or EMT, cell migration, and invasion through different mechanisms). Therefore, the
team has identified TTK and Nek2 as mitotic kinases that can be targeted in NHB and H/L women to suppress
metastatic TNBC. Given the preliminary results that the co-inhibition of mitotic kinases can suppress cell
migration and invasion to a larger extent than their single inhibition, and that these kinases can drive EMT
through distinct EMT transcription factors, the team proposes the hypothesis that the TTK and Nek2 mitotic
kinases cooperate to signal metastasis in TNBC by activating distinct EMT signal transduction pathways. The
overarching goal of this supplement, and what sets it apart from the parent proposal, is to identify at the
global genomic transcriptional level and the protein phosphorylation levels the mechanisms by which TTK
and Nek2 regulate global EMT pathways in TNBC cells from NHB women, and in TNBC PDX models from
C-H/L and NHB women. This will allow the team to identify the detailed mechanisms by which TTK and Nek2
support early metastasis by identifying the EMT master regulators (EMT transcription factors) whose
expression is modulated by the inactivation of TTK and Nek2 (Sub Aim 1.1), and how the phosphorylation
profile of proteins is involved in cell division, apoptosis, and EMT is affected upon co-inactivation of TTK and
Nek2 (Sub Aim 1.2)."

Cervical cancer causes significant impact on society, as it is a high cause of female mortality, with over 600,000 women
diagnosed each year. Locally advanced disease is best treated with a combination of external beam radiation (EBRT)
followed by brachytherapy. Brachytherapy delivers a focused, high dose into the tumor that is best directed by the use
of MR imaging at the time of brachytherapy to ensure that the entire tumor can be treated with radiation. The
placement of brachytherapy catheters, is typically done without any guidance, and complications due to inadvertent
insertion into normal tissues (blood vessels, rectum, bladder), rather than into residual tumor, may result. Magnetic
resonance-guided brachytherapy (MRBT) has significantly improved survival and reduced complications caused by
inadvertently radiating neighboring tissues. Identifying normal tissues as residual tumor before MRBT may result in
inadvertent treatment with radiation of healthy tissues, which increases complications. MRI multi-parametric
identification of post-EBRT residual tumor, combined with actively-tracked catheter placement into the disease as seen
on MR scanning, can result in a more precise treatment volume, and faster and more accurate MRBT catheter
placement, leading to better outcomes and reduced complications. This should increase the use of MRBT in treating
cervical cancer, as well as recurrent endometrial, vaginal, prostate, and other cancers.
The proposed procedure utilizes several novel tools: (a) MRI sequences that map the tissue parameters perfusion,
diffusion, fibrosis and oxygenation in the post-EBRT pelvis, which are analyzed by expert clinicians, and used to develop
a method for providing refined remnant tumor maps; and, (b) instantaneous intraoperative dose mapping, where
catheter locations at any time during placement are used to predict and guide what the clinician’s best next move
should be, such as changing current catheter locations or adding more catheters. Together, these methods will
culminate in dose-optimized catheter placements that will lower tumor recurrence and limit radiation side effects.
This project is a collaboration between Johns Hopkins University and Elekta Inc. JHU radiation oncologists, radiologists,
medical physicists and MRI physicists, along with a panel of experts in identifying remnant tumor, will work jointly with
Elekta engineers to develop an innovative platform with broad applications in radiation oncology."

Sign language is vital to the lives and well-being of many deaf people in the United States who rely on this
mode of communication. However, current theories in linguistics, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience have
all been developed primarily from investigations of spoken language. The focus on speech leaves open many
critical questions about linguistic phenomena that are fundamentally shaped by the visual-manual modality.
NIDCD recognizes these gaps in our understanding – the Strategic Plan states, ”Enhancing our understanding
of visual-manual language systems opens a window into general human cognition (pg. 32).” This project aims
to develop a neurobiological model of sign language perception and comprehension that takes into account
essential modality-specific phenomena: phonology without sound, lexical iconicity (non-arbitrary mappings
between the form and meaning of signs), and `spatial syntax' (the use of locations in signing space to express
grammatical roles and co-reference). Aim 1 of the project is to map the cortical representation of phonological
structure in American Sign Language (ASL) using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI
adaptation methods will be used to investigate whether body-selective neural regions become tuned to
linguistic handshapes and body locations in signers. In a second fMRI study, Phonological Neighborhood
Density in ASL will be manipulated to identify neural areas that support lexical-level phonological
representations. Aim 2 of the project is to identify the impact of iconicity on lexical representations and
learning. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) will be used to assess whether effects of iconicity are task
dependent (e.g., related to the use of picture stimuli) or reflect distinct neural representations for iconic signs
(e.g., more robust encoding of sensory-motor semantic features). ERPs will also be used to investigate
whether brain responses to iconic signs change with learning and whether learners represent signs as
wholistic gestures or are sensitive to internal phonological structure. Aim 3 of the project is to identify the
neural network involved in comprehending `spatial syntax'. fMRI will be used to determine whether right
parietal cortex is engaged when understanding ASL verbs that are directed toward locations in signing space
(R-loci) to indicate grammatical roles. A second fMRI experiment is designed to identify the neural correlates of
spatial indexing (the establishment and maintenance of R-loci). Overall, the project aims to enhance our
understanding of the neurobiology of visual-manual language, which will provide a translational foundation for
treating injury to the language system and for diagnosing language impairments in deaf individuals."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and the World. We recently
demonstrated that programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, which lead to durable responses in a minority of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, have greater efficacy in patients with charged HLA-B binding
pockets whose tumors harbor mutation(s) leading to what we have designated as motif neoepitopes. Motif
neoepitopes have an amino acid substitution in the second position of a nonamer generating a change in charge
from the wild type peptide with the resultant amino acid having a charge opposite from the HLA-B binding pocket.
To date, the immunological changes induced by motif neoepitopes have not been explored. We propose a
comprehensive evaluation of the underlying mechanism, focusing on patients with HLA-B44 supertype alleles
because of the prevalence (approximately 40% of the population) and distribution of HLA-B44 across racial and
ethnic groups. We will evaluate samples in the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) from patients with at least one HLA-
B44 supertype allele to explore differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) among patients with or without
motif neoepitopes by examining gene expression and cellular composition by slide review and algorithms based
on gene expression profiles. We will evaluate surgical specimens from treatment naïve patients with or without
HLA-B44 motif neoepitopes and evaluate spatial signatures of the TME by multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF).
We will assess multiple sections from each specimen to identify biomarkers most significantly associated with
motif neoepitopes. We will further examine immune contextures of the TME associated with motif neoepitopes
by single cell RNA-seq analysis.
To elucidate the predictive value of motif neoepitopes in early stage NSCLC patients, we will perform whole
exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptomic data, which we now routinely obtain in our NSCLC patients as part
of patients' clinical care. We will analyze the presence and expression of genes harboring motif neoepitopes.
Together, these studies will provide a better understanding of the TME and other immunologic changes
associated with the presence of motif neoepitopes.
Dr. Velez is trained as a medical oncologist, and her true goal is to bring innovative clinical trials to representative

about stastitical analysis as part of her training to date. However, she has not spent much time working on
modern techniques to analyze biospecimens. Analysis of biospecimens are generally what provide junior

11001858,"Liver cancer is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related deaths in the US; its incidence has almost tripled
since 1980. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most prevalent form of liver cancer. Latino/Hispanic (LA)
populations are disproportionately affected by HCC compared to Caucasians (CA) with respect to prevalence,
progression, drug response, and mortality. In addition to infectious and metabolic diseases, socio-behavioral
factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, stress) are the major risk factors for HCC. Although ethnic differences in
HCC progression and treatment outcome are known, the responsible molecular mechanisms are not understood.
The interplay of these risk factors with oncogenic mechanisms in relation to this disparity are also unknown. Our
group has identified a novel oncogenic protein, MUC13 mucin, which is highly overexpressed and aberrantly
localized in some cancers. This protein is associated with tumorigenic/metastatic phenotypes and is correlated
with smoking, alcohol consumption, and biochemical stress factors. Preliminary data suggest a markedly higher
expression/aberrant localization of MUC13 in HCC LA samples than CA samples. However, the clinical functional
significance and regulatory mechanisms of MUC13 expression in HCC are unknown. The association of socio-
behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, stress) with MUC13 expression pattern in relation to this
disparity has not been investigated. Sorafenib is a clinically used chemotherapy for HCC; it blocks the
Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, whereas MUC13 overexpression induces this oncogenic signaling axis. Our group has
developed reagents related to MUC13, including unique monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, our group has access
to a liver cancer bio-specimen repository that has HCC samples from different groups including LA and CA
populations. We propose to investigate the role of MUC13 in HCC disparity and elucidate the etiological factors
that are responsible for aberrant MUC13 expression in HCC. We hypothesize that the differential/aberrant
expression of MUC13 is a critical molecular determinant associated with health disparities in HCC. Additionally,
we hypothesize that socio-behavioral factors influence MUC13 expression in HCC. Aim 1 will determine how the
MUC 13 expression patterns in HCC tissue samples retrospectively collected from LA and CA populations differ
among different stages of disease and between the populations, and will correlate MUC13 expression patterns
with disease progression, metastasis, and patient prognosis and survival. Aim 2 will determine the association
between socio-behavioral factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, biochemical measures of stress) and MUC13
expression/phosphorylation patterns in HCC samples from the two patient populations. Aim 3 will ascertain the
role of MUC13 in HCC progression, metastasis, and Sorafenib responsiveness, and its disparities between LA
and CA HCC, via the use of patient-derived cells, organoids, and patient-derived xenograft models. This project
will generate new information regarding the role of MUC13 in HCC health disparity that ultimately may help to
reduce the disparity among disproportionately affected and underserved LA populations."
10981122,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Transient cerebral ischemia occurs in various clinical scenarios, including transient
ischemic attack (TIA), cardiac arrest, hypovolemic shock, cardiac surgery, and medical conditions related to
brain edema or brain vasospasm. The majority of cerebral ischemia survivors experience long-term neurological
sequelae due to brain ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). The objective of the proposed research is to investigate
a novel mechanism of the dysfunctional mitophagy and the subsequent excessive accumulation of damaged
mitochondria (mito hereafter) after cerebral ischemia. These damaged mito release apoptotic factors and
reactive oxygen sciences (ROS) contributing to brain IRI.
 Mitophagy, a subtype of (macro)autophagy, selectively delivers damaged mito to lysosomes for
degradation. N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) is the sole ATPase for regulating cellular membrane fusion
events. We have found that NSF is deposited into inactive protein aggregates in neurons destined to die after
cerebral ischemia. These NSF-deficient neurons progressively accumulate with substantial amounts of damaged
mito and autophagic/mitophagic structures, suggesting that NSF is a crucial limiting factor for regulating
mitophagic degradation activity, i.e., mitophagic flux. Furthermore, we recently generated a novel neuron-specific
NSF-deficient mouse line. In the absence of brain ischemia, neurons of the NSF-deficient mice exhibit a
substantial accumulation of mitophagic structures and damaged mito, which subsequently leads to autonomous
neuronal death. This phenotype replicates major neuropathologic features observed in wildtype (wt) mice after
cerebral ischemia. Moreover, our recent studies have demonstrated that NSF-overexpression (overexp)
protected, while NSF-deficiency exacerbated brain IRI in the mouse model. Based on these discoveries, we
propose to test a novel hypothesis strongly supported by our data: NSF inactivation results in dysfunctional
mitophagy, leading to an excessive buildup of damaged mito after cerebral ischemia. These damaged mito
release apoptotic factors and ROS, contributing to brain IRI. We will test this hypothesis by investigating: (i)
whether, where, and why NSF inactivation disrupts the mitophagy pathway after cerebral ischemia using NSF-
deficient, NSF-overexp, and wt mice (Aim 1); and (ii) the mechanism responsible for the post-ischemic NSF
inactivation as well as the corresponding treatment strategies using pharmacological agents in the mouse
cerebral ischemia model. The proposed studies will help to: (i) determine if NSF inactivation induces brain IRI
via disrupting mitophagic degradation activity; (ii) distinguish the mitophagy-related and -unrelated impairments
that are explicitly caused by NSF inactivation from those affected by NSF-independent events; and (iii) discover
the mechanism and treatment strategies for alleviating NSF inactivation after cerebral ischemia. These studies
will provide the necessary foundation for developing therapeutics to restore the mitophagic degradation activity
after cerebral ischemia."
10981671,"ABSTRACT
This research proposal focuses on the complex development of inner ear cells from various embryonic
lineages and the challenges of establishing multi-lineage inner ear tissues in vitro. The inability to routinely
utilize patient-derived inner ear explants due to their delicate nature prompts a necessity for a unique
approach. Thus, the project's long-term objective is to uncover the chemical and physical signals required to
cultivate functional inner ear tissue from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro. Building on past
technological advancements, the research will refine a three-stage 3D culture system to create inner ear
organoids (IEOs) – a model that successfully generates sensory hair cells, neurons, glia, and mesenchymal
cells. The project seeks to overcome current limitations of IEO heterogeneity and free-floating nature, which
restrict live-cell imaging applications essential for advancing drug discovery and gene therapy testing. The
primary goal is to develop a standardized, reproducible IEO-on-a-chip system that mirrors the human fetal
inner ear, comprising sensory epithelia, peri-otic mesenchyme, and neural inputs. The project has three
specific goals: 1) refine the production and purification of otic organoid cellular components, 2) decipher the
physio-chemical needs for on-chip otic morphogenesis, and 3) establish image-based assays to investigate
hair cell function and dysfunction in IEOs-on-chip. We intend to use genomic data from every stage of IEO
development and leverage cell-cell communication analysis to enhance otic cell production. Next, we aim to
engineer an on-chip microenvironment promoting self-assembly of tubular otic sensory epithelia. Finally, the
study plans to establish image-based assays for on-chip assessment of genetic perturbation to hair cell
functional maturation using models related to the deafness-blindness disorder Usher Type 1. The successful
completion of this project would lead to a first-of-its-kind tissue chip for inner ear research, offering significant
value in the development of innovative gene therapies, as well as protective and regenerative drugs. The
proposed system shows potential in addressing current research challenges and spurring advancements in
understanding and treating hearing and balance-related diseases."
10981674,"New treatments are urgently needed for parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs; hookworms, whipworms,
roundworms) that infect ~1.5 billion people and cause significant morbidity in children, pregnant women, and
working adults. Mass drug administration with albendazole has not been curative, and there are limitations
with additional approaches involving ivermectin and the experiment drug emodepside. Controlling GINs
remains a critical unmet medical need. For over 60 years, Bacillus thuringiensis crystal (Cry) proteins have
been safely and massively used to combat insect pests that vector disease and damage crops. Pioneering work
has shown that some Cry proteins (e.g., Cry5Ba) target nematodes and are anthelmintics. Orally administered
Cry5Ba is highly effective against GINs in rodents, dogs, sheep, pigs, and horses and against all three major
human GIN classes. The goal here is to develop Cry protein anthelmintics to meet World Health Organization
(WHO) Target Product Profiles (TPPs) for GIN anthelmintics and perform key studies leading to first in human
trials. Anthelmintic Cry proteins can be delivered via a simple-to-produce, inexpensive, safe, and a scalable
form of anthelmintic Cry protein called IBaCC for Inactivated Bacteria with Cytosolic Crystal(s). Currently, six
Cry proteins are known anthelmintics. The means to study all three GIN classes in rodents, to measure synergy
of Cry protein combinations, to produce hybrid (domain swapped) Cry proteins with increased activity, and to
produce IBaCC in commercially relevant yields via industry collaborators are successfully in hand. These
advancements will be leveraged here to engineer Cry protein therapies to meet the WHO's TPP to target all
three GIN classes with high efficacy, low dose, and low cost and to advance Cry protein anthelmintics to the
clinic. In Aim 1, it is hypothesized that the WHO TPP will be achieved by identifying synergy among all pairwise
combinations of six anthelmintic Cry proteins in vitro against all three classes of GINs. All synergistic
combinations will be tested in vivo in rodents against all three GIN classes at a Step 1 TPP of 5 mg/kg. Fit for
purpose formulation strategies for improved gastric resistance and anthelmintic efficacy in rodent models vs.
the three GINs will also be tested in this aim. In Aim 2, it is hypothesized that the WHO TPP will be achieved
by swapping domains among the six anthelmintic Cry proteins to generate hybrid Cry proteins. These hybrid
proteins will be tested in vitro against all three GIN classes for superior efficacy and then in vivo in rodents
against all three GIN classes at the Step 1 TPP. Combining Cry proteins (1) and swapping domains among Cry
proteins (2) are evolutionary strategies seen in nature to increase Cry protein efficacy and spectrum of activity.
In Aim 3, the best Cry protein combinations will be tested against multi-drug-resistant dog hookworms in vitro
and in vivo in order to select a single lead candidate for GLP-toxicological studies as a prelude to first in human
trials. The results will identify optimal combinations of Cry proteins and hybrid Cry proteins that meet the
recommended WHO TPP, with safety studies in place for progression of a lead anthelmintic to clinical trials."
10984323,"Overall Project Summary / Abstract.
With just over a million people in the entire state, Montana lacks an adequate healthcare infrastructure
throughout our rural areas, contributing to significant and prevalent health disparity issues. These issues can
be directly addressed by investing in clinical and translational (C&T) research. As noted in our letters of
support, the University of Montana has numerous C&T investigators from a variety of disciplines, but uniformly
working with clinical partners on C&T research is not common. We have assembled a strong team of both
clinical and public health partners (Partner Organizations), allowing us to not only grow C&T research capacity
but also to translate research findings to our “communities”, which includes our new Practice-Based Research
Network, rural clinical sites, public health / tribal health departments, and community members themselves.
Our team has extensive experience working within the Clinical and Translational Research (CTR) funding
mechanism, participating in Core Director roles in the Mountain West CTR Infrastructure Network (Mountain
West CTR-IN) for the last 10 years. In addition, we already have strong, existing relationships with clinical and
public health stakeholders throughout our state. With an evaluation plan consisting of a mixed method design,
we will test the overall hypothesis that the Montana Clinical and Translational Center (Montana CTRC) will
significantly build C&T research capacity in our rural and underserved state. We will test this hypothesis
through three Aims: Aim 1) Provide mentorship and workforce professional development to enhance the
capacity and infrastructure in conducting C&T research, Aim 2) Administer clinical and translational research
projects, and Aim 3) Integrate translational research within community settings."
10981992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) encompass a broad constellation of highly prevalent and etiologically
heterogeneous disorders that share several key diagnostic features. These include motor incoordination,
abnormal sensory processing, intellectual and developmental disabilities, epilepsy, and neuropsychiatric co-
morbidities such as autism, anxiety, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Together, these
findings suggest that NDDs result from the perturbations of brain regions critical for motor, non-motor, and
sensorimotor information processing. One such region is the cerebellum, which forms multiple circuits with
cortical and subcortical regions to modulate movement, language, cognition, sensory processing, executive
function, and social behaviors. Intriguingly, cerebellar vermian hypoplasia (CVH) is a common neuroanatomical
finding in NDDs and lesions or malformations of the vermis result in communication and behavioral deficits,
suggesting that disrupted cerebellar development may perturb multi-modal information processing. In 2016, we
and others discovered that a previously unrecognized NDD, the Hypotonia, Ataxia, and Delayed Development
syndrome (HADDS, MIM#617330), results from either heterozygous loss-of-function (LOF) or single gene
deletions of Early B-Cell Factor 3 (EBF3). EBF3-related NDDs are characterized by the namesake features,
co-morbid autism, atypical cerebellar foliation, and CVH. EBF3 encodes a Collier/Olf/EBF3 (COE) transcription
factor that regulates multiple neurodevelopmental processes, including GABAergic-inhibitory neuronal
differentiation. We found that Ebf3 haploinsufficiency in mice recapitulated analogous neurobehavioral deficits
and cerebellar dysmorphisms. Hence, elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of EBF3-related
NDDs affords a unique opportunity to study the impact of cerebellar dysfunction in NDDs. The primary goal of
this proposal is to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of cerebellar inhibitory neuronal
dysfunction in NDD pathogenesis through a detailed dissection of a well-defined monogenic disorder. Our
unifying central hypothesis is that cerebellar inhibitory Purkinje cells and GABAergic interneurons are
vulnerable to EBF3 LOF and lead to cerebellar dysfunction in EBF3-related NDDs. We will define the spectrum
of cerebellar deficits, molecular alterations, and phenotype-genotype correlations in EBF3-related NDDs (Aim
1), identify Ebf3 expression in the cerebellum and associated gene regulatory networks for cerebellar inhibitory
neuronal development (Aim 2), and determine the vulnerability of cerebellar inhibitory and excitatory neurons
to Ebf3 LOF (Aim 3). This proposal focuses on incorporating in-depth human phenotyping with integrated
mechanistic studies of Ebf3 haploinsufficiency at the cell-type-specific level in mouse models. The cross-
species approaches in this project provide innovative opportunities to elucidate the interplay between
cerebellar development, inhibitory neurons, and cognition, communication, and complex behaviors. These
findings will have broad implications for advancing our understanding of cerebellar dysfunction in NDDs."
10981244,"Administrative Core – Summary
The overarching aim of the Climate and Health: Action and Research for Transformational Change (CHART)
Center is to launch a transformative and integrative framework for climate health research, from molecules to
populations, that generates and drives evidence-based impactful solutions. The Administrative Core (AC) is the
heart of CHART, providing direction, support, oversight, and evaluation to ensure that CHART goals are
achieved in line with the NIH Climate and Health Initiative. CHART is working across multiple Schools and In-
stitutes at Columbia University, building on existing climate change and health research and training expertise
and further expanding capacity by integrating advanced climate science, large-scale epidemiologic studies,
omics, toxicology, advanced environmental statistics, data science, and machine learning. To this end, CHART
is structured around two Cores—the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and Integrated Data and Exposure
Analytics (IDEA) Core—in addition to the AC, as well as two Research Projects investigating the association
between multiple co-occurring climate-related threats and neurodegeneration. Project 1 will leverage nation-
wide claims data and longitudinal analyses of a well-characterized aging cohort (mid- to macro-scale), while
Project 2 will identify network biology-based markers of climate-induced neurodegeneration (micro-scale).
CHART’s resources are optimally designed to help investigators address emerging climate and health chal-
lenges, develop and harness new methods, and innovate actionable solutions to advance CHART’s mission
and climate and health research in general. The AC will be the central hub that manages these efforts, coordi-
nating and integrating CHART components and activities and facilitating interactions with other Climate
Change and Health Research Centers (CCHRC), the Research Coordinating Center (RCC) to Support Climate
Change and Health Community of Practice, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Specifically, the AC will
(1) establish a leadership and administrative structure that fosters coordination and integration; (2) promote
research capacity building through pilot projects, seminars, and networking events; and (3) assess productivity,
effectiveness, and appropriateness of Center activities and strategies. The AC will provide central oversight,
support, integration, and translation for all CHART activities. Through an effective supportive structure, the AC
will provide robust leadership and guidance for CHART to achieve its mission by building upon our existing ex-
pertise and leveraging transdisciplinary and integrative collaborations to transform climate and health research
towards actionable solutions."
10981245,"Project 1 – Summary
Climate change is and will remain the most important threat to human health. As emissions keep driving tem-
peratures higher, climate threats (e.g., wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, flooding, etc) are increasing in inten-
sity and most of these in frequency as well. Several climate-relevant exposures have been linked to adverse
health outcomes, such as mortality, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. Although some preliminary evi-
dence and biological plausibility exist, the association between climate-relevant exposures and neurodegener-
ation has not been fully investigated. Furthermore, most existing studies characterizing the impacts of climate
threats on adverse health outcomes have focused on a single exposure at a time. However, many of these cli-
mate events co-occur (compound events), with variation across space and time. Health analyses that charac-
terize the overall impact of exposure to multiple climate threats simultaneously, thus, are critical to fully under-
standing the impact of climate threats on neurodegeneration. Importantly, performing analyses with a climate
justice lens is critical for equitable solutions for protection and mitigation. We will address these critical re-
search, methodological, and knowledge gaps as part of Project 1. To do so, we will leverage nationwide data
on multiple climate-relevant exposures (temperature, temperature variability, heat and cold waves, wildfires,
tropical cyclones, Nor’easters, flooding, droughts, tornadoes, extreme precipitation, and secondarily air pollu-
tion) and Medicare claims since 2000. We will focus on Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) as
the main neurodegenerative outcome of interest. Complementary to this approach, we will also leverage well-
characterized cognitive function outcome data in the Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project
(WHICAP), a prospective study of aging and dementia. Specifically, we will (1) characterize spatio-temporal
patterns in co-occurrence of climate threats across the US (2000–2020) and develop climate region-specific
indices of exposure to multiple co-occurring climate threats (climate threat index, CTI); (2) investigate the as-
sociation between short-term exposure to multiple co-occurring climate threats and ADRD-related hospitaliza-
tions; and (3) examine the association between multiple climate exposures and cognitive function among
WHICAP participants. Housing is a major pathway through which health disparities emerge and are sustained.
Housing characteristics and conditions are modifiable; identifying those housing characteristics and conditions
that are associated with worse climate change-induced adverse health outcomes can lead to equitably actiona-
ble solutions. We will examine, thus, whether the identified patterns of co-occurring climate threats, CTI, and
the examined associations with ADRD-related hospitalizations and cognitive function vary by housing charac-
teristics and conditions. We expect that our findings will provide actionable insights and help guide equitable
and efficient interventions, investments, and mitigation plans for protecting the people and communities who
are most vulnerable to climate threats."
10981246,"Project Summary – Project 2
In this project we will strive to identify the biological mechanisms by which climatic factors increase vulnerability
to age-related neurodegeneration. We will leverage ongoing studies of Alzheimer’s disease in a New York City-
based multi-ethnic community cohort, as well as employ laboratory models to explore biological mechanisms.
We will use multi-species and multiomic approaches with network biology to identify climate-related biological
vulnerabilities. One of the most obvious dynamic and unpredictable external conditions is the weather; age-
associated pathologies are notably exacerbated by severe weather and temperature. Complementing Project 1,
which uses national claims data to takes to examine trends in age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,
this project will take a systems-level approach to delve into how climatic exposures alter biological pathways
associated with age-associated neurodegeneration. We will use a combination of human prospective cohort data
and well-controlled laboratory animal data to generate multiomic network models of climate-induced biological
disruption. In our multi-ethnic cohort of human aging and neurodegeneration we have used an exposome-based
approach to generate data from plasma samples and from brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs).
We will examine how the New York City-specific Climate Threat Index variables influence network biology and
disease-related outcomes. We will also use model organisms to examine to examine the impact of a well-
controlled example of climate-related disruption, namely, extreme temperatures, on biological networks. Our
hypothesis is that components of the Climate Threat Index will disrupt specific biological nodes and that these
disruptions will be reflected in neurodegeneration-associated outcomes. We will test this hypothesis through the
following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the effects of climate disruption on Alzheimer’s disease-related
changes in network biology. The residences of cohort participants are geocoded allowing us to model complex
climate factors with changes in network biology. Aim 2. To explore the use of brain-derived circulating
extracellular vesicles as a source of climate-related biomarkers of neurodegeneration. Our team has access to
data from brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the same AD cohort as above. Aim 3. To determine the
impact of dramatic temperature disruptions on network biology in model organisms. We will utilize the short-
lifespan nematode worms (C. elegans) and Killifish (N. furzeri) to study the effects of extreme temperatures on
age-associated pathology and lifespan using analogous measures to those used in Aims 1 and 2 allowing a
cross-species analysis of temperature-induced changes in biological networks. Completion of these aims will
provide a foundation for using multiomic-based network biology to study complex climatic changes on human
health and disease contributing to the overall mission of CHART."
10981247,"Project Summary – Community Engagement Core
Climate change is a health crisis that is simultaneously widening health disparities, exacerbating social
vulnerability, and hindering society’s ability to deliver healthcare. Under the joint leadership of Dr. Ami Zota and
Dr. Yoshira Ornelas Van Horne, the Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the Climate and Health: Action and
Research for Transformational Change Center (CHART) seeks to respond to this growing crisis by advancing
evidence-based solutions for climate health equity within New York City (NYC) and beyond by creating networks
of emerging leaders who can drive change with their communities. We seek to engage community-based
researchers, climate data scientists, and community changemakers to increase awareness of the public health
impacts of climate change and the capacity for evidence-based action. As facts alone do not lead to change, we
will prioritize principles of storytelling which combine emotions, biases, logic, and beliefs to enhance public
communication. Our vision for the CEC leverages the infrastructure, resources, and networks of successful
programs at Columbia University to ensure CHART is responsive and relevant to community needs. These
programs include Agents of Change in Environmental Justice (AoC-EJ) and the Global Consortium on Climate
and Health Education (GCCHE). AoC-EJ seeks to cultivate more diverse, equitable, and inclusive leadership in
environmental, climate, and health sciences by training scientists from systemically marginalized backgrounds
in science communication. GCCHE seeks to ensure that all health professionals worldwide have the knowledge
and skills to prevent, reduce, and respond to the health impacts of climate change. As part of the CEC, we will:
1) Integrate the NYC perspective of climate vulnerable community members into all activities of the CHART, 2)
provide researchers and community changemakers with the editorial and technical skills to translate their climate
and health research into compelling documentary films for a public audience, and 3) advance evidence-based
solutions for climate health equity within New York City by training and advancing emerging community leaders
through the Climate Health Equity Fellowship. The CEC will help incubate, communicate, and disseminate
research and policy strategies that promote climate health equity at local, national, and international levels.
Critically, the CEC will center the voices and needs of communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis as it
trains emerging scientific and community leaders—ultimately promoting community-driven research to advance
climate justice."
10981248,"Project Summary - Integrated Data and Exposure Analytics (IDEA) Core
The overall goal of the Integrated Data and Exposure Analytics (IDEA) Core is to coordinate and facilitate
research and training across the Climate and Health: Action and Research for Transformational Change Center
(CHART). This will be achieved by supporting data systems and data science approaches to expedite study
design, data collection, analysis, integration, and dissemination; and by facilitating climate-related exposure
assessment, integration, and modeling activities. While the framework will be applicable for the long-term plan
of advancing climate and health-related research and training at Columbia University and beyond, initial setup
and focus will be on the two research Projects and the pilot studies that are to be funded through the Pilot Project
Program (P3). The Core activities will be organized around four interrelated but complementary aims; namely,
(1) providing statistical resources, data analysis capabilities, and reproducibility tools; (2) integrating and
enhancing data management and harmonization, sharing, and interoperability; (3) providing support on exposure
assessment, modeling, and integration; and (4) providing capacity building and training across CHART through
a well-designed workshop series and engagement of researchers and trainees focusing on climate and health.
Through these aims, the IDEA Core will be able to provide centralized oversight of study design, data analytic
approaches, data management and harmonization, software development and implementation as well as quality
assurance/quality control (QA/QC). It will also be able to foster data sharing and interoperability plans across
CHART and beyond. The IDEA core will support exposure assessment, modeling, and integration for the two
Projects and/or pilot projects, as well as relevant climate and health-related activities within CHART and beyond.
Another major function of the IDEA Core is Capacity building, mainly built around the workshop series that will
be run in coordination with the Administrative and Community Engagement Cores. IDEA Core activities will be
dynamic and nimble to reflect the evolution of CHART as well as developments in climate science and data
science broadly – in response to an active feedback mechanism across CHART. The Core is well positioned to
help in prioritization of CHART activities and will ensure quality control by continuous monitoring of analytic
strategies and adherence to standard operating procedures (SOPs) set by the projects. By ensuring proper study
design and analytic approaches are employed, data management protocols and operations are integrated across
all Projects and Cores, and appropriate exposure assessment and modeling techniques are utilized, the IDEA
Core will enhance CHART’s mission via quantitative input to transform climate and health research towards
actionable solutions through transdisciplinary and integrative collaborations."
10981310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interactions between bacteria and their viruses (phages) are among the most ubiquitous in nature and have
yielded transformative tools for genetic engineering, such as restriction enzymes and CRISPR-Cas. More than
three dozen new bacterial immune systems have recently been discovered across many bacterial species.
Some of these immune systems, such as CRISPR, target phage for cleavage, while others sense phage
infection and induce bacterial death to halt phage spread. In turn, phages express “anti-immune” proteins to
disarm these bacterial defenses, including “anti-CRISPR” (Acr) proteins that inhibit Cas effector functions.
Phage-derived interactors (either inhibitors or activators) have not yet been found for most of these immune
systems, however.
The long-term objective of this proposal is to identify phage proteins that interact with or trigger activation of
these immune systems. These interactions will be identified using yeast two hybrid screens and validated
using affinity purification-mass spectrometry analysis in bacteria. In the two-hybrid screen, the Gal4
transcription factor will be split into an activation domain and DNA-binding domain and fused to each phage
“prey” protein and bacterial immune “bait” protein, respectively. Interaction between the prey protein and bait
protein should reconstitute the full transcription factor and enable expression of a reporter gene that confers
survival on selective media. Rationally selected phage proteins will be screened for interactions with CRISPR-
Cas proteins as well as immune proteins that lack known interactors. This versatile platform will accelerate the
discovery of phage-bacterial interactions, which have long transformed molecular biology and gene therapy.
In parallel, the strategies that phage use to inactivate CRISPR-Cas systems in bacteria will be applied to gene
therapy in human cells to reduce cytotoxicity and off-target effects. Phages that constitutively inactivate Cas9
and Cas12a in bacteria often block both targeting and expression, which is likely optimal for long-term Cas
inactivation. Mammalian gene editing performed with Cas9 delivered on viral vectors often causes off-target
mutations and cytotoxicity associated with long-term Cas9 expression. To mitigate these off-target effects,
strategies to inactivate CRISPR-Cas complexes and reduce their expression (after on-target editing has
occurred) will be combined and compared. This work will be performed at UCSF, which hosts world-class
facilities and a highly intellectual and collaborative research community. It will also provide me with the
expertise in protein-protein interaction screens and gene editing that I need to fulfill my postdoctoral training
goals and pioneer an independent research program in bacterial-phage interactions."

University) with a PhD in Biomechanics and Movement Science (University of Delaware). She is Assistant
Professor in Physical Therapy and Orthopaedic Surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis, having completed her postdoctoral fellowship (Washington University School of Medicine). Dr. Zellers is
a translational, tendon researcher with expertise in in vivo and ex vivo assessment of human subjects and
tissues to elucidate person- and tendon-specific characteristics influencing patient treatment and outcomes.
Mentor and Advisory Committee: Dr. Farshid Guilak will be primary mentor, bringing extensive experience as a
principal investigator in orthopaedics and specific expertise in leveraging the mouse models included in this
study to answer similar questions regarding the effect of obesity in the context of osteoarthritis. Drs. Alayna
Loiselle and Spencer Lake are co-mentors imparting tendon-specific expertise including mechanical,
histological, and molecular biological outcomes assessment. Drs. Gretchen Meyer and Simon Tang are co-
mentors with experience leveraging similar animal models to investigate questions relating to fat-muscle
crosstalk and collagenous soft tissue healing, respectively.
Training Plan: In this Career Development Award, Dr. Zellers will gain training and experience in leveraging
animal models (murine models of obesity, lipodystrophy, and tendon injury) to investigate mechanisms
underlying observations gleaned from her clinical, human studies research line. The proposed training plan
emphasizes building skills in incorporating animal models into her translational research program. Training
goals also incorporate biological approaches to tendon assessment, specifically histological and molecular
biological techniques, which will carry over to Dr. Zellers’s study of human tendon tissue. This award would
provide the training and experience for Dr. Zellers to grow as a translational researcher with a comprehensive
toolkit of in vivo and ex vivo techniques spanning preclinical models to human tissues to human subjects.
Research: Obesity presents both mechanical and biochemical effects on tendon tissue homeostasis and
healing that have not been well elucidated. The proposed study leverages murine models of obesity and
lipodystrophy to determine the effects of high bodyweight and metabolic dysfunction on tendon tissue. We
hypothesize that metabolic dysfunction, more so than mechanical load, promotes tendon degeneration (Aim 1)
and impairs healing (Aim 2), evidenced by abnormal histological appearance, altered gene transcription,
disrupted collagen organization, and impaired tendon function at the tissue and functional performance levels.
Institutional Commitment to the Candidate: Dr. Zellers holds a tenure-track faculty position and has been
provided bench and clinical laboratory space, start-up package, and trainee support."
10982888,"Some of the greatest human health impacts from climate change are mediated by infectious diseases. Billions

(VBD) are increasing due to climate change. In response to these urgent threats, Cornell University and the
University of Pretoria have newly partnered to create the Center for Transformative Infectious Disease
Research on Climate, Health and Equity in a Changing Environment (C-CHANGE). To have the greatest
health impacts, we must change research and practice paradigms from reactive focus on response to outbreaks
to proactive understanding of the complex social and environmental determinants that promote risk of outbreaks.
We hypothesize that community-engaged research integrating human, reservoir and vector behavior, climate,
land-use, human and animal health, and vector/pathogen genomic evolution datasets, will enable creation of
predictive epidemiological models and future generation and rigorous testing of preventative interventions.
Improved understanding of these relationships will also facilitate current preparation/response. Working toward
these goals, we integrate dimensions of building research capacity and performing transdisciplinary research in
every element of C-CHANGE. Administrative Core (Travis, Oosthuizen, co-PIs): will facilitate routine meetings;
administer a pilot grant competition with preference for Early Stage Investigators (ESI) to generate preliminary
data and test feasibility for future studies; and organize transdisciplinary training for ESIs, post-doctoral and
graduate student trainees to broaden their skills and network for future climate change and health research.
Living Evidence Applied Data Modeling Core (Hayden-ESI; Smith-ESI; Marivate-ESI, co-leads): will federate
current datasets from 4 continents and provide transdisciplinary modeling expertise to enable researchers to
integrate climate, land-use, animal and human health, and genomic data to help identify generalizable vs context-
specific relationships. Community Engagement Core (Meredith-ESI, van Wyk, co-leads): will engage with
every project to enable/perform community-informed research that is relevant and can effect long-term positive
change, and will perform comparative surveys in South Africa, Zimbabwe and the US to lay foundations for future
research proposals. Project 1 (Plowright, Markotter, co-leads): hypothesizes that climate extremes and land use
changes result in wildlife stress, increasing both viral shedding and interaction with humans, facilitating viral
spillover events (paramyxo-, corona-, and filoviruses). Project 2 (Goodman-ESI, de Jager, Riddin-ESI,
Ueckermann-ESI, Oosthuizen, co-leads): hypothesizes that an integrated framework for a community-based
early warning system for climate-sensitive VBD can promote human health, building upon existing remote
sensing with new focus on mosquito-borne arboviruses and tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma, Rickettsia,
Coxiella), including genomic analysis for hotspots of selection. Center function is supported by world-class

most affected, there is limited inclusion of these communities in CC and health research. Residents of climate-
vulnerable communities, in particular, have a profound stake in the global community's understanding of CC and
health and strategies to adapt. In fact, they are key to developing action-oriented solutions that address CC-
related health inequities. The central theme of the Anga Center for Climate Justice, Health Equity, and
Community Well-being in East Africa is to improve climate justice, health equity, and community well-being
by exploring climate-related health and well-being and interventions to strengthen them through building
transdisciplinary research capacity and fostering sustained community engagement and empowerment in
climate vulnerable communities and marginalized populations.
 The Anga Center will be led by a multinational, multistage, transdisciplinary team of researchers with
expertise in social work, climate science, climate adaptation and mitigation, environmental engineering and
science, public health, biostatistics, psychiatry, community development, intervention science, community-based
participatory research, and women and gender studies and a strong history of ethical, community-engaged
research in the EA region. With a commitment to community engagement and empowerment, the Center aims
to support communities with infrastructure, technical skills, knowledge sharing, and career opportunities in CC,
and we will work to cultivate multi-directional information sharing, targeted trainings, capacity building, and key
opportunities for networking with a diverse set of stakeholders. We will achieve our overall goal by: (1) fostering
research that promotes climate justice, health equity, and community well-being through explorations of the
impacts of CC and related events and interventions that minimize negative impacts and improve overall health
and well-being in climate-vulnerable communities and marginalized populations in EA; (2) Building local and
regional CC and health research and science capacity by fostering long-term transdisciplinary and community
partnerships, enhancing local data collection and methodologies, and providing capacity building through
knowledge sharing; and (3) empowering communities most vulnerable to climate change through sustained,
committed, multi- directional relationships, community-engaged research, and efforts to enhance community
well-being. The Center's combined aims of improving health and well-being, building research capacity, and
empowering communities will create a sustainable system of research that will advance climate justice, health
equity, and community well-being and contribute to critical CC and health science in EA and globally."

 The Administrative Core will expertly manage the overall functioning and resources of the Anga Center
to ensure sustainability, equitability, well-being, and value within the Center and in the contributions we make to
climate change and health research in East Africa. The administrative core will use a non-hierarchical, equity-
focused approach to foster in-person and virtual spaces for engagement and collaboration of transdisciplinary
researchers and diverse stakeholders; plan and implement meetings and activities and multinational and
multicultural events; co-produce strategic plans for the future of the Center; and oversee finances, resources,
and monitoring and evaluation. The Core will provide a centralized system of support, accountability,
transparency, organization, evaluation, and communication designed to ensure both efficiency and longevity of
the Anga Center and to establish sustainable, equitable, and ethical partnerships between the Center and diverse
stakeholders and communities. We prioritize shared power and recognize historical and present power dynamics
between Global North and South leaders. The Administrative Core is committed to establishing equitable and
respectful partnerships with Global South partners, communities, and diverse stakeholders, prioritizing dignity
and collaborative dialogue, and maintaining communal decision-making while remaining mindful of power
dynamics. The Administrative Core follows the principles of Critical Consciousness Theory (CCT), emphasizing
group discussions to unite in the shared desire for change. By embracing principles of community-engagement
and Ubuntu, the Administrative Core will strive for a community-centric approach that values each stakeholder's
voice, experiences, and knowledge and cultivates an equitable and culturally sensitive organizational structure
that prioritizes collaboration. We will work to cultivate a flexible hybrid work model that aligns with the goals of
all Cores. This approach promotes integration, coordination, mutual respect, and a sense of support within our
organizational culture, ensuring that both in-person and remote team members are equally integrated into our
non-hierarchical structure, all built on a foundation of belonging and trust. Recognizing both the benefits and
limitations of hybrid work and virtual spaces, we will work to cultivate models for the Administrative Core and the
Administrative Core's support of the Anga Center that prioritize equity and inclusion. The Administrative Core will
be guided by a set of four specific aims: (Aim 1) to provide oversight of all funding and resource allocation and
ensure ethical conduct of research for the overall center and across all cores and projects; (Aim 2) to ensure
integration and multidirectional collaboration between Center members and external stakeholders through
biannual conferences focused on climate justice, health equity, and community wellbeing in East Africa and
regular internal meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions; (Aim 3) to plan, coordinate, and organize activities
and resources, including external and internal communications, scheduling, logistics, and human resources,
(Aim 4) to Provide an equitable, rigorous, impactful evaluation structure for the overall Center and its cores."
10982427,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Climate change (CC) is expected to exacerbate CC-related extreme weather events (EWEs) in East
Africa (EA), with studies citing increased trends in temperature extremes and, to a lesser extent, changes to
seasonal and annual rainfall. Acute and longer-term CC-related EWEs are expected to have a profound impact
on psychological well-being and mental health, especially for women and those living in ecologically sensitive
areas like floodplains and wetlands. CC has been associated with increased despair, suicidal ideation, and
violence and conflict. Climate vulnerable communities are not only especially exposed to CC-related EWEs, but
often face barriers to adaptation such as political and social marginalization, poverty, exclusion from formal
essential services, and/or legal land tenure. Although research on mental health prevalence in climate vulnerable
communities in lower-income countries (LICs) is limited, findings from recent studies indicate that depressive
disorder, suicide attempts, psychosocial stress, and intimate partner violence are likely higher in some
communities, like informal settlement, pastoral and small-holder farming communities, than other settings.
 Early warning systems (EWSs), such as hazard advisories based on localized forecasts, save lives and
avoid expensive economic expenses and improve preparedness and Forecast-based Financing. The proposed
study will investigate experiences of EWEs and direct and indirect associations between EWEs and mental
health and violence-related outcomes using longitudinal data from 18 vulnerable communities across Kenya,
Tanzania, and Uganda. Because there is a paucity of research focused on the effects EWEs may have on
climate-vulnerable residents' mental health, well-being, and experiences of violence, and affordable
interventions to prevent negative outcomes, this Research Project will also pilot a localized EWS intervention in
these communities. Findings from this study could provide helpful information about important climate thresholds
related to mental health and interpersonal violence in vulnerable communities, uncover key pathways between
these phenomena, and test a low-cost, targeted intervention aimed at helping residents of these communities to
prepare for and cope with EWEs. The Research Project will be guided by the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Explore and compare prevalence and frequency of climate conditions in vulnerable communities.
Aim 2: Develop localized impact-based thresholds using participants' experiences of EWEs.
Aim 3: Investigate associations and potential pathways between climate conditions and mental health, well-
being, and interpersonal violence in vulnerable communities.
Aim 4: Explore preliminary effects of a localized EWS intervention on women's mental health, well-being, and
interpersonal violence in vulnerable communities.
 This 27-month study integrates all aspects of the Anga Center—meaningfully engaging communities,
establishing a strong administrative foundation, and building capacity for future CC and health research in EA."
10982428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
East Africa is in the midst of a climate crisis as one of the most vulnerable regions of Africa to climate change
(CC) and related extreme weather events (EWEs). CC will exacerbate already existing temperature extremes
and changes in precipitation in this region, and these environmental changes are likely to have a profound
impact on health and well-being. Even though countries and communities that contribute the least to CC are
often those most affected, there is limited inclusion of these communities in CC and health research. The Anga
Center for Climate Justice, Health Equity, and Community Wellbeing's central theme is to improve climate
justice, health equity, and community well-being by exploring climate-related health and well-being and
interventions to strengthen them through building transdisciplinary research capacity and fostering sustained
community engagement and empowerment in climate vulnerable communities and marginalized populations.
The Center's Community Collaborative Core seeks to improve local and regional CC and health science and
research by cooperating with and empowering community members from three East African (EA) nations
(Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) throughout the research process. One of our key strategies for achieving this
goal is to ensure the authentic collaboration of individual- and organizational-level stakeholders of populations
who face disproportionate vulnerabilities related to adverse CC and health outcomes: members of informal
settlements, pastoralists, and small-holder farming communities. Guided by community-based participatory
research (CBPR) and influenced by critical consciousness theory, gender transformative approaches, and
African Ubuntu philosophy, our Community Collaborative Core team will comprise 3 community collaborative
boards (CCBs) and a research team of 18 Field Managers and 36 community data collectors, in support of the
Center research projects. The problems addressed through the Core align with our Anga Center theme to
produce mutually beneficial, multi-directional relationships between communities and academic institutions in
the U.S. and EA. We will work together to facilitate multi-directional engagement and close collaboration
between community stakeholders, governments, partners in the humanitarian sector, and Center members to
identify common, actionable, community-defined priorities; solutions-oriented research questions and design;
and reporting/application of results, new strategies, and opportunities (Aim 1); employ, train, and empower
community members as research team members (Aim 2); and ensure culturally appropriate translation and
application of the Center findings and disseminate research results and evidence-based solutions to guide
equitable climate adaptation research and policy change in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda (Aim 3).
meaningfully engage community in all aspects of Anga Center research—leading to relevant outcomes that
can inform decisions to mitigate negative CC-related health impacts, disseminate educational tools and
materials, and promote global health equity."
10982429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Residents of climate vulnerable communities—defined as those most susceptible to, or unable to cope
with, adverse effects of climate change (CC), including climate variability and extremes—and marginalized
populations, especially, women, youth, and people living with disabilities have a profound stake in the global
community's understanding of CC and health and strategies to adapt to the climate crisis. Research suggests
that bottom-up approaches to CC and health research that actively engage participation of local communities
and leverage and strengthen local capacities ensure reduced vulnerability. This is the key principle of the
Capacity Building Core. The overall goal of the Anga Center's Capacity Building Core is to enhance local and
regional CC and health science and research by investing in infrastructure, early-career researchers, and climate
vulnerable communities and by building the knowledge and technical and scientific skills of and relationships
between future CC and health researchers and communities in multi-directional ways. One of our strategies for
achieving this goal is to support communities most vulnerable to CC and early-career researchers in CC and
health and to cultivate meaningful relationships and knowledge-sharing between the two.
 There is incredible potential to enhance CC and health research and CC adaptation particularly in low-
income countries (LICs), through investing in local climate-related infrastructure, facilitating community-based
learning, co-producing knowledge, and increasing the usability of climate science information. Using a multi-
pronged, non-hierarchical, equity-focused approach, the Capacity Building Core will work to achieve these goals
in East Africa. Through the installation of relatively low-cost local weather stations that can be integrated into
existing national and regional weather and climate monitoring networks; investments in capacity-building
opportunities for climate vulnerable communities; and knowledge integration and exchange between scientists,
researchers, and community members, the Capacity Building Core will strive to enhance local and regional CC
and health science and the co-production and utilization of knowledge for and within these communities (Aim
1). Recognizing the critical importance of encouraging and supporting early-career investigators in CC and health
we will focus part of the attention of the Capacity Building Core on supporting a multinational, multidisciplinary
cohort of future leaders of climate change and health (FLCCH) PhD students through fellowships, mentorship,
trainings, seminars, workshops, and hands-on research opportunities (Aim 2). Finally, the Capacity Building
Core will focus on promoting interdisciplinary research and fostering authentic partnerships between CC
scientists, health investigators, and climate vulnerable communities or populations through a pilot research
project program (PRPP). The PRPP will provide interdisciplinary teams of researchers, including at least one
early-stage researcher, funding to carry out a community-engaged pilot research project and mentorship support
to apply for extramural funding using the data collected during the pilot project (Aim 3)."

The proposed project is a resubmission by two promising Early-Stage Investigators as multiple principal
investigators (PAR-22-189). The overall goal of this multi-phase proposal is to prepare for (R61) and execute
(R33) a randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of Rehabbing with Peloton for improving physical
activity among patients receiving transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and evaluating the
implementation of the intervention for future scalability. Despite ample evidence of the benefits of cardiac
rehabilitation, only a small fraction of TAVR patients participate, which is thought to be a combination of missed
referral opportunities coupled with patient-borne challenges including transportation, scheduling, and physical
access to facilities. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation is particularly low among women and racial and ethnic
minorities, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, and/or living in rural areas, contributing to
disproportionate morbidity and mortality burden in these patients. Overseeing cardiac rehabilitation content on
commercially available fitness platforms (such as the Peloton mobile app) may be an excellent format for
ensuring rehabilitation-appropriate modules while reaching TAVR patients currently under-referred and
underusing cardiac rehabilitation. In our preliminary work, we engaged TAVR patients and cardiologists to
develop the Rehabbing with Peloton intervention. RWP is an 8-week intervention in which TAVR patients
engage with the Peloton app (not the fitness bike) to promote physical activity. RWP is a clinically reviewed,
pre-set user account controlled by the research team that includes specific modules focusing on walking,
strength exercises, yoga breathwork, and stretching, areas of exercise training previously used in home-based
cardiac rehabilitation. Building on our previous multidisciplinary research, this proposal describes an innovative
type II effectiveness-implementation hybrid randomized control trial of TAVR patients comparing RWP to
attention control, controlling for technology. We will dedicate the R61 phase of the project to milestone-driven
startup of the trial to successfully start recruitment by month 9 of the project. During the R33 phase, we will
randomize N=200 individuals receiving TAVR from the University of Colorado Hospital Heart and Vascular
Center to RWP or attention control. At baseline, post-intervention (8 weeks), and follow-up (12 months), we will
assess participants’ physical activity (smartwatch accelerometer measured daily steps) and secondary
outcomes of interest including functional capacity (Duke Activity Status Index; VO2max), quality of life (Kansas
City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire), and cardiovascular health status (Life Essential 8). The aims of the study
are to test the efficacy of RWP on physical activity at 8 weeks (Aim 1) and secondary outcomes (Aim 2). We
will use mixed methodologies to evaluate the implementation of RWP using the Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) Framework (Aim 3). Overall, this research will provide
insight into the use of commercial mHealth to deliver CR to a population disproportionately excluded from CR."
10985968,"Hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-A) and Limbic predominant age related TDP-43 encephalopathy
neuropathologic change (LATE-NC) are important degenerative pathologies that are closely related but distinct.
Around 20% of older age dementia is attributable to these two conditions. HS-A is diagnosed when there is
disproportionate atrophy in a brain structure called hippocampus and LATE-NC is characterized by abnormality
of an essential protein, TDP-43. Clinically, both pathologic changes mimic Alzheimer’s disease pathology and
present with memory problems. Despite their importance, none of the pathologies can be diagnosed during life
and can only be found by examining the brain after patients die. Moreover, both HS-A and LATE-NC frequently
co-occur with Alzheimer’s disease pathology. This makes their diagnosis even more challenging. This is
especially important in an era that specific treatments for these protein abnormalities are being developed.
Therefore, there is significant unmet need for discovering ways to diagnose them during life.
In the current cycle of the grant, we showed that our quantitative method is more informative than standard
pathologic measures in identifying relationships between HS-A and clinical impairment and presence of other
pathologies. We also found that clinical features of HS-A and LATE-NC are remarkably similar to Alzheimer’s
disease. We found that MRI detects atrophy of hippocampus in HS-A, and this is an early finding making MRI a
suitable tool for HS-A diagnosis. We have also found indications that autoimmunity plays a role in HS-A.
The objective of this proposal is to advance our HS-A discoveries and to start new investigations on pathological
assessment and diagnosis of LATE-NC in an ethnically diverse group of participants. Inclusion of ethnically
diverse participants will allow for studying the prevalence and impact of these important pathologies in a
representative sample of our population. The study will use the resources of four ongoing studies of older
individuals across two Alzheimer’s disease research centers at University of California (UC), Irvine and UC Davis,
The 90+ Study, and LifeAfter90 Study.
 In aim 1, we will replicate our HS-A results in a new and ethnically diverse group of participants that will
validate our methods. We will also test the hypothesis that quantitative assessment of LATE-NC will identify
novel associations with cognitive impairment and other brain pathologies. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that brain MRI and glucose PET scan, can identify features that are specific to HS-A and LATE-NC. In aim 3,
we hypothesize that blood markers of autoimmunity and inflammation are related to HS-A and LATE-NC
respectively and measuring TDP-43 and progranulin in blood, can serve as markers of LATE-NC.
Successful completion of this proposal, we lead to major advancement in the diagnosis of two important dementia
related pathologies that cannot be diagnosed during life. This will not only enable realistic assessment of the
effectiveness of Alzheimer’s therapies but will also pave the way for clinical trials of HS-A and LATE-NC."
10985192,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) account for approximately 15% of all breast cancer diagnoses
but are disproportionately burdened with metastatic disease and breast cancer death due to high rates of
recurrence and a lack of risk-reducing treatment options in the surveillance phase. The transition to surveillance
is marked with distress and prognostic uncertainty regarding fears of cancer recurrence at a time when contact
with the oncology team decreases. Patients with TNBC are at greater risk for poor psychosocial outcomes as
TNBC frequently occurs in younger patients, in Black and Hispanic patients, and in patients harboring high-risk
genetic mutations. Despite the dire needs of patients with TNBC, no coping and supportive care interventions
currently exist for this population. To address this gap, the proposed study details a five-year plan to develop,
refine, and pilot-test a nurse-led, coping, and supportive care intervention (TRANSITIONS) to address the needs
of patients with TNBC as they transition from curative therapy to surveillance at Massachusetts General Hospital
and three community affiliates. The aims of this project are to (1) to develop and refine TRANSITIONS based on
preliminary data with patients with TNBC, diverse stakeholder feedback, as well as patient feedback from an
open pilot study (N=5-8), (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of TRANSITIONS by conducting a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N=75), and (3) to estimate the preliminary effects of TRANSITIONS for
improving psychosocial outcomes in the pilot RCT. The candidate, Dr. Kathryn Post, assembled a mentor team
comprised of internationally recognized investigators in behavioral interventions, patient-reported outcomes,
cancer care (Joseph Greer, PhD), TNBC (Leif Ellisen, MD, PhD), and supportive care trials in patients with breast
cancer (Jamie Jacobs, PhD). A scientific advisory committee will provide guidance on: qualitative data methods
(Lara Traeger, PhD); equity in breast cancer care (Beverly Moy, MD, MPH); nurse-led interventions in cancer
survivorship (Teresa Hagan Thomas, PhD, BA, RN); and biostatistics (Dustin Rabideau, PhD). Dr. Post will
achieve her short-term goals through a coordinated research and training plan in (1) behavioral and cognitive-
behavioral-therapy-based intervention development, (2) RCT design, testing, and conduct, and (3) longitudinal
assessment and analysis. In addition to regular mentorship meetings and experiential training included in the
research plan, Dr. Post will complete advanced coursework and didactic training, attend and present at seminars
and national conferences, and publish findings in peer-reviewed journals. This K08 proposal details Dr. Post’s
plans to gain mentorship, didactic training, and career development to facilitate her transition to research
independence. Dr. Post’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator and a leading nurse scientist
in supportive oncology. With the additional training and mentorship this K08 will provide, Dr. Post will contribute
to national and international efforts to reduce symptom burden and improve the quality of life for patients with
cancer."
10990146,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diffuse midline gliomas with H3K27M alteration (DMG-H3K27M) are the leading cause of pediatric
brain tumor-associated deaths. All DMG-H3K27M becomes resistant to radiation, the standard of care, and
most children succumb to their disease within two years of diagnosis. New treatment options are urgently
needed. The applicant's long-term goal is to combine engineering and cancer cell biology to lead a research
group that advances extracellular vesicle (EV)-based drug delivery for central nervous system diseases like
DMG-H3K27M. EVs are potent signaling vehicles in the tumor microenvironment and are understudied in
DMG-H3K27M. The overall objectives are to define how DMG-H3K27M derived EVs contribute to radiation
resistance within a heterogenous tumor and to develop EVs as a delivery vehicle for brain-penetrant
radiosensitizers while equipping the applicant with the skills to become a strong, independent cancer
researcher. Preliminary data show that some subclones within DMG-H3K27M are inherently radiation resistant
and can release EVs readily taken up by radiosensitive cells in a receptor-mediated manner. These EVs
protect the recipient tumor cells from radiation-induced cell death. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that the
cargo of DMG-H3K27M extracellular vesicles, particularly microRNAs, drives radiation resistance within these
tumors and that targeting these factors can sensitize DMG-H3K27M cells to radiotherapy. Additionally, the
selective uptake of EVs by DMG-H3K27M cells suggests that EVs can be exploited as a drug delivery tool. The
rationale is that this research will provide novel insights into mechanisms of radioresistance in DMG-H3K27M
and may result in new approaches to target this cancer. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific
aims: 1) Determine the mechanism of EV-mediated radioresistance in DMG-H3K27M and 2) Engineer
extracellular vesicles to selectively target brain tumor cells and deliver radiosensitizers. The first aim will be
carried out as part of the dissertation research and will use patient-derived DMG-H3K27M cells, proteomics
approaches, and chemical inhibitors to define the mechanism of EV uptake. miRNA mimics and antagomirs will
also be used to overexpress and silence miRNAs found in EV cargo released from radioresistant cells to
identify miRNAs that confer enhanced radioresistance in DMG-H3K27M. Targets will be validated using
zebrafish xenograft models. The second aim will encompass the post-doctoral research and focus on using
single-cell microfluidic methods to engineer non-tumor extracellular vesicles for specificity towards brain tumor
cells and assessing their capability to cross the blood-brain barrier to deliver radiosensitizers. The research
proposed in this application is significant because it will provide new insights into the role of tumor
heterogeneity in driving therapy resistance. This project will also identify new mechanisms of DMG-H3K27M
radioresistance and develop an innovative strategy for drug delivery to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of
radiosensitizers in the brain, potentially improving treatment outcomes for children with DMG-H3K27M."
10976122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Metabolomics Workbench (MW) – National Metabolomics Data Repository (NMDR) is a unique data
resource that serves the biomedical research community. It was started through the NIH Common Fund
Metabolomics Initiative over a decade ago and has developed into a one-of-its-kind metabolomics data
repository and resource. Projects ranging from independent investigator studies involving metabolic
measurements (funded through R21 or R01 mechanisms) to large national initiatives, including several Common
Fund-driven metabolomics studies, find their home in the NMDR. The NMDR contains almost 3000 studies,
some very large, containing more than 1000 human subjects. The metabolomics data generated by the
researchers can be submitted through easy and facile mechanisms that have evolved over the years by the MW.
The MW-NMDR is widely regarded as one of the most FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, usable) data
resources of its kind. The sunset associated with the Common Fund Projects has mandated the need for
mechanisms to sustain data, such as the NMDR, and the RFA offers the mechanism for this perpetuation for the
community. This proposal will address two essential aspects needed for the metabolomics resource.
The first and primary objective of the MW-NMDR proposal is the continuation of the repository and resource
along with the evolution of all features currently present in the infrastructure. The MW-NMDR receives
approximately 50 study submissions, some very large, each month and offers mechanisms for easy upload of
the data followed by curation by the MW team. It is subsequently transferred into a relational database along
with the metadata to make the data discoverable. These mechanisms require continuous maintenance and
updating. The MW also houses a metabolite structure database and RefMet, the reference metabolite
classification and annotation system, which facilitates data harmonization. The metabolite database and RefMet
require continuous updating, an essential task for the MW. The outreach and engagement of the biomedical
research community is another need of the MW-NMDR; continuing this effort with additional mechanisms is a
key objective.The second objective of the MW-NMDR proposal is the enhancement of the infrastructure through
multiple mechanisms. First, the dramatic growth in the data warrants easy discovery mechanisms. Towards this,
we will develop a graph database and query system, which will enable researchers to pose complex
queries/filters to discover data and access them. We will develop a Neo4j graph database along with an
interactive graph visualization interface that will facilitate dynamical queries in a cascading manner. This will
obviate the need for a researcher to learn sophisticated computer skills. Second, we will develop a simple and
accessible human subjects’ clinical metadata model to help create specified cohorts and the associated
metabolomics data. Third, we plan to provide data in multiple formats using tools and interfaces. Finally, we will
develop further the cloud aspects of MW-NMDR and provide AI-ML-ready datasets."
10976123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Despite considerable
progress in the treatment of early-stage disease, a significant frequency of patients will develop recurrence with
distant metastases. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype with a dismal
prognosis; it lacks the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression and, therefore, is
resistant to treatments targeting those pathways. Interestingly, harnessing the immune system through
immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved survival rates; albeit modestly, when used
in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy. Thus, TNBC remains a neoplastic disease with unmet
clinical challenges. New preliminary data in our laboratories indicate that loss-of-function of TAZ, the key
component in the Hippo signaling pathway, inhibits tumor progression in mouse models of TNBC in immune
competent, but not immune deficient mice, indicating that tumor TAZ expression plays an underappreciated
extrinsic role in TNBC biology. Mass cytometry analysis suggested that tumor TAZ expression acts extrinsically
to regulate the recruitment and/or function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and, perhaps, tumor-
associated macrophages (TAMs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs). Additional mechanistic studies showed that
TAZ knockdown in preclinical TNBC models led to a reduction in MDSCs, as well as a reduction in the expression
of several cytokines/chemokines, particularly CCL20, potentially linked to the mobilization of MDSCs. Thus,
these findings implicated a previously unrecognized biology of tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression in regulating TNBC
progression via its actions on the immune-tumor microenvironment (TME), notably MDSC trafficking. The overall
objectives of this proposal are to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TAZ expression
regulates the accumulation of immune suppressive cells like MDSCs in the TME of TNBC. Our central
hypothesis is that TAZ expression in TNBC regulates the TME landscape via cancer cell non-autonomous-driven
mechanisms. Our long-term goals are to decipher the crosstalk between TAZ expression in TNBC and the
immune contexture of the TME to uncover new prognostic or therapeutic targets in TNBC biology. To achieve
these goals, we propose the following three aims: 1) determine the impact of tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression on
the immune-tumor microenvironment in preclinical models of TNBC; 2) determine the molecular mechanisms by
which tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression recruits MDSCs to the TME; and 3) determine the relationship between
tumor TAZ expression and the immune-tumor microenvironment in patients with TNBC. A major impact of this
study is to identify previously undescribed TAZ-mediated mechanisms that will unveil new biomarkers or inform
novel therapeutic interventions for advanced or metastatic TNBC."

Increased evidence started to show that many germline mutations predispose individuals to myeloid neoplasms,
including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). One of these mutations occurs on DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41)
gene. More than 80 distinct DDX41 variants have been reported, making DDX41 one of the most frequently
mutated MDS predisposition genes. Germline DDX41 mutations lead to its loss of function, whereas somatic
mutations often produce hypomorphic changes. Our understanding of the roles of DDX41 in the hematopoietic
system and how DDX41 mutations predispose myeloid neoplasms is still in its infancy. It is essential to dissect
the molecular and cellular mechanisms of DDX41’s functions, which is critical to developing targeted therapy for
DDX41 mutated MDS. G-quadruplexes (G4) are noncanonical secondary nucleic acid structures formed in
guanine-rich sequences. DDX family proteins have been shown to resolve DNA G4 structures. We found in our
preliminary study that loss of DDX41 led to aberrant upregulation of G4 in the hematopoietic cells, especially the
erythroid lineage. Aberrant G4 accumulation due to DDX41 deficiency severely disrupted erythropoiesis with
fewer effects in other lineages in vitro and ex vivo. Importantly, we confirmed these findings in vivo using lineage-
specific Ddx41 knockout (KO) mice, which showed that the lethality of hematopoietic-specific Ddx41 KO mice is
likely due to the defects in erythropoiesis. Our preliminary mechanistic studies indicate that DDX41 directly binds
to and dissolves G4. Ddx41 deficiency-mediated G4 upregulation compromised erythroid genomic integrity and
ribosomal biogenesis, which upregulates p53 and activates the cGAS-STING pathway. Our additional in vivo
preliminary experiments reveal that the knockout of cGas, but not p53, rescued the lethality of hematopoietic-
specific Ddx41 KO mice. Based on these data, we hypothesize that DDX41 loss of function in MDS causes
aberrant G4 accumulation, which leads to genomic instability and cGAS-mediated cell death predominantly in
erythroid cells. To test our hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 will focus on the study of the
functions of DDX41 in various lineages of hematopoietic cells by generating lineage-specific Ddx41 knockout
mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate the functions of DDX41 in G4 homeostasis in erythropoiesis. Aim 3 will focus
on the mechanism of DDX41 deficiency-induced ineffective erythropoiesis and MDS pathogenesis. Successful
completion of our proposed research will provide novel insights into DDX41’s functional role in normal and
abnormal hematopoiesis, which will be impactful for the development of novel therapies for DDX41 mutation-
related hematologic diseases."
10990946,"Project Summary (Abstract):
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of childhood muscular dystrophy, is caused by
mutations in the gene encoding the protein dystrophin. In addition to debilitating muscle degeneration, patients
display a range of cognitive deficits and comorbidities with neurodevelopmental disorders thought to result
from loss of dystrophin normally expressed in the brain. While the function of dystrophin in muscle tissue has
been well characterized, its role in the brain is still poorly understood. The highest expression of dystrophin in
the brain is in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC), where it colocalizes with postsynaptic GABAA receptor clusters.
Dystrophin is a member of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), a large transmembrane protein
complex thought to act as a transsynaptic signaling/adhesion molecule through binding to presynaptic neurexin
or neurexin-like proteins. Mice lacking expression of dystrophin show a severe (~40-60%) reduction in the
number of inhibitory synaptic connections, suggesting dystrophin and the DGC are necessary for inhibitory
synapse formation or maintenance. However, the role of the DGC in these processes has not been
determined. We hypothesize that dystrophin and the DGC are critical for maturation of inhibitory
synapses during development. Our preliminary data suggests that in the absence of dystrophin expression,
inhibitory synapses on PC remain in an immature state into late development. We find that a wide range of
anatomical and functional measures of synapses function remain at immature levels in dystrophin-deficient
PCs. Understanding basic mechanisms of inhibitory synapse maturation will be critical to understanding
neurodevelopmental disorders arising from impaired synaptic development. Understanding the function of
dystrophin and the DGC at inhibitory synapses will provide critical guidance for developing future treatments
and therapies for DMD symptoms related to brain function. We will investigate the role of dystrophin and the
DGC in inhibitory synapses maturation in the following three aims:
Aim 1: Determine the role of dystrophin and the DGC in inhibitory synapse maturation.

Thousands of children in the United States receive treatment for acute pain each year, and even more
experience pain that is unrecognized. The majority of those who are treated receive interventions that have not
been proven to be safe or effective in children. Inadequately treated acute pain can lead to chronic pain and
multiple adverse outcomes. Rigorous trials performed under a structured research and data ecosystem that
address acute pediatric pain are urgently needed. To address this critical, unmet public health need, we will
establish the Duke-Utah HEAL Kids Pain Resource and Data Center (Duke-Utah RDC). Our RDC will support
multi-site clinical trials within the HEAL KIDS Acute Pain Clinical Trials (APCT) with the overarching goal of
harmonizing these trials in an integrated program with shared objectives, procedures, and tools to maximize
knowledge gained in pediatric pain. The Duke University Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and The University
of Utah, two powerhouses in clinical trial and data coordination with an established history of collaboration, are
uniquely positioned to establish this RDC. We will leverage the capacity and experience of the world’s largest
academic research organization, DCRI, and the pediatric trial and informatics expertise of the Utah DCC to
integrate high-quality logistics and operations, experienced communications management, and sophisticated
data and informatics solutions for the HEAL KIDS program. The faculty on our proposal, who include
pediatricians with subspecialty expertise (Greenberg, Benjamin, Watt) and experts in informatics (Sward), will
provide coordination, support, and consultation to HEAL KIDS program investigators and trial data coordinating
centers, building their capacity to implement well-designed, efficient trials that produce high-quality, easily
accessible data. To achieve this vision, we will establish 2 RDC cores: 1) a Data Curation and Harmonization
Core; and 2) an Administrative and Communications Core. These cores will engage proactively with the ACPT
trial teams, data coordinating centers, NIH, and other stakeholders to accomplish the following specific aims: 1)
Create and sustain a harmonized HEAL KIDS Pain research and data ecosystem; 2) Facilitate compliant data
sharing and seamless accessibility to maximize future research; and 3) Support effective communication within
the program and to the broader research community. Our HEAL KIDS Pain research and data ecosystem will
lay the foundation for the generation of harmonized data. We will ensure that these data are submitted to
public use repositories and easily accessible to investigators through the use of sophisticated informatics tools.
The Duke-Utah RDC will fuel the successful completion of the awarded APCT trials while maximizing the
impact of the resulting data to ensure forward progress in the management of pediatric pain conditions. Our
infrastructure will serve as a model and foundation for future pediatric pain trials."

Funds are requested to support Advancing Eye Health through Data Science and Artificial
Intelligence Symposium to be held September 27, 2024, in the Starr Center for Scientific
Communications at the Schepens Eye Research Institute of Mass. Eye and Ear (MEE). The
meeting is co-organized by Dr. Lucia Sobrin, Professor of Ophthalmology and Associate Chief
for Clinical Data Science, Harvard Department of Ophthalmology and Dr. Tobias Elze,
Associate Professor of Ophthalmology and co-director of the MEE Clinical Data Science
Institute. This will be an inaugural meeting. Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) studies
in vision research are growing exponentially and have great promise for generating discoveries
that can be translated to clinical care. As AI increasingly enters the clinical realm, it will be
important that its integration to care is done in an ethical and robust way. Therefore, the
proposed symposium is a timely and important meeting. The goal of this symposium is to bring
together international experts who offer novel data and stimulate discussion about how to
leverage AI and Big Data to improve eye health. In addition, given the importance of Data
Science and AI will continue to increase over time, another goal of the symposium is to engage
trainees and young investigators in the field so that they are able to carry on the work in the
future. We estimate this meeting will attract close to 250 attendees, consisting of senior and
junior scientists, graduate trainees, postdoctoral fellows, and biotechnology/pharmaceutical
representatives. Topics to be covered include the application of AI and Big Data for diabetic
retinopathy detection, glaucoma progression and identification of systemic disease with
ophthalmic data. Funds are requested to support the trainee attendance and provide 10 trainees
with travel awards to cover their airfare and accommodations. This meeting is distinct from other
meetings focused on AI/Data Science in its in-person format, with half of the scheduled time for
discussion and multiple opportunities for unstructured interaction between trainees, younger
investigators and more established investigators at the morning networking break, lunchtime
poster session, and evening reception/dinner."
10994331,"Project Summary
The proposed study seeks to identify genomic features that explain epidemiological co-occurrences of childhood
cancers (CCs) and structural birth defects (SBDs). We will import germline and genomics data from affected
cohorts into the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Data Distillery Knowledge Graph (DDKG) project, an
ongoing CFDE project that generated a comprehensively annotated graph database built with empirical data
from 11 Common Fund projects with over 40 million data points and 300 million relationships, and which utility
has been proven through successful applications of several complex use cases.
Our goals for this proposal are first to expand and update the DDKG schema to support a broader spectrum of
genomic data types and edge (relationship) weighting by evidence level. This expansion will expand the DDKG’s
information capacity and better support machine learning applications on extracted data. Datasets chosen from
this project are based on epidemiological observations on the relationships between congenital heart defects
and neuroblastoma or hematological malignancies, and brain or CNS congenital defects and brain tumors. Data
from representative cohorts with any or both selected CCs and SBDs will be obtained from the Kids First project
as germline and tumor data. We will also incorporate genomics data from the NCI Molecular Targets Project into
the DDKG, representing a comprehensive repository of childhood cancer genomics data produced by the lead
principal investigator.
We will analyze the DDKG data for predicted relationships between SBDs and CCs with strategies including
topological link prediction methods, the Connect the Dots algorithm, dimensionality reduction methods (such as
embeddings) with cluster detection, and machine learning with PyG’s support for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for heterogeneous graphs. User data delivery will be accomplished with the DDKG project’s pre-built tools, and
by developing and refining innovative data delivery methods. This will enhance the accessibility of the project's
findings and extend the utility of the DDKG for the broader research community.
With the analysis of large-scale pediatric cohort genomics data, we seek to set a precedent for large-scale
genomics data analyses using Common Fund Data while providing significant insights into the genetic drivers of
CCs and SBDs, paving the way for future research and clinical applications. Other researchers can utilize the
DDKG with our methodology developments, increasing the opportunities to reuse CFDE data."

Macrophage polarization enables macrophages adapt to various microenvironmental cues and adopt a spectrum
of functional phenotypes. These are generally classified into classically activated (pro-inflammatory, M1) and
alternatively activated (pro-healing, M2) categories. The M1/M2 balance determines the extent and severity of
inflammatory responses and tissue damage. However, the signaling pathway(s) and cues driving
macrophage polarization in the oral cavity's infectious milieu are largely unknown. Yes-associated protein
(YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are transcriptional co-activators implicated
in inflammation regulation and macrophage polarization in a context-dependent manner. Despite the
observation of aberrant YAP1/TAZ expression in gingival tissues from patients with periodontitis, the triggers
and mechanisms of YAP1/TAZ signaling in regulating macrophage polarization in periodontium remain
unclear. Our previous R01 study unveiled the suppressive role of serum- and glucocorticoid- inducible kinase
(SGK) 1 in the immune response to the oral pathogen. Using Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) as a model
organism, in this renewal project, we aim to investigate the regulation of YAP1 by SGK1 in Pg-stimulated
macrophages and its subsequent impact on macrophage polarization, thereby revealing a novel
regulatory module, SGK1-YAP1, in periodontal inflammation. Preliminary results showed that (i) SGK1
inhibition remarkably decreases YAP1 phosphorylation and increases its nuclear retention in Pg-stimulated
macrophages; (ii) Pg infection enhances YAP1 phosphorylation and promotes its retention in the cytoplasm, and
the ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor further augments YAP1 expression; (iii) YAP1 inhibition suppresses
macrophage polarization towards M1 phenotypes; and (iv) sgk1 deficiency increases nuclear YAP1 expression
and the M1/M2 ratio in the gingival tissue from mice subjected to repeated Pg infection. These findings lead to
our hypothesis that YAP1 cytoplasmic retention and expression are controlled by SGK1 in response to
Pg challenge. This control mechanism limits macrophage polarization towards M1 phenotypes, thereby
preventing tissue damage and periodontal inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we will (i) determine and
characterize the regulation of YAP1 by SGK1 in innate immune cells in response to Pg; (ii) functionally dissect
SGK1-YAP1 signaling pathways in macrophage polarization upon Pg challenge; (iii) assess the effect of SGK1-
YAP1 signaling in vivo on macrophage polarization and disease process induced by Pg using murine infection
models. Successful completion of this study will identify SGK1 as a novel regulator of YAP1/TAZ signaling,
functioning through dual mechanisms of phosphorylation and ubiquitination. For the first time, we will delineate
the alternative macrophage polarization mediated by Pg via SGK1-YAP1 signaling. This work not only advances
our understanding of macrophage polarization in periodontium but also could inform studies aimed at identifying
novel targets to restore macrophage subset balance, thus ameliorating/preventing Pg-induced tissue destruction."
10981996,"Project Summary
We propose to elucidate fine molecular mechanism of arrestin-1 interaction with rhodopsin, focusing on
the aspects of this mechanism that ensure remarkable selectivity of arrestin-1 for light-activated
phosphorylated rhodopsin and much lower binding to all other functional forms of rhodopsin (inactive
phosphorylated, light-activated unphosphorylated, inactive unphosphorylated, opsin, and phosphorylated
opsin). We propose to design “enhanced” arrestin-1 mutants with high binding to unphosphorylated light-
activated rhodopsin. We expect these mutants to compensate for defects in rhodopsin phosphorylation in
vivo. Mutants of this kind have therapeutic potential in human visual disorders caused by absent or
insufficient rhodopsin phosphorylation. Based on the discoveries of non-rhodopsin binding partners of
arrestin-1 we propose to use in vivo proximity labeling to identify novel arrestin-1 interaction partners in
rod photoreceptors. These partners will be biotinylated by AirID fused to arrestin-1 (we validated both
functions of the two fusions we propose to use), purified via biotin binding to avidin, digested into
peptides, which will be identified by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)."

 The work proposed in this study seeks to investigate the role of macrophages colonization by Neisseria
gonorrhoeae (Ng) during infection and the impact on gonorrhea development. Because Ng is a highly human-
adapted pathogen, it has developed numerous mechanisms to avoid and actively suppress innate and adaptive
immune responses. We uncovered that Ng colonizes and establishes topologically distinct colonies in
macrophages. During colonization, Ng manipulates the actin cytoskeleton to invade and create an intracellular
niche supportive of bacterial replication. This new model of Ng persistence in macrophages is significant for
gonorrhea symptomatology and outcome since the relevant cellular reservoir of bacteria during in vivo infections
has yet to be identified. Here we will uncover (1) the host receptors required for macrophages colonization by
Ng; (2) bacterial adhesins involved in macrophages colonization; and (3) the role of macrophages colonization
by Ng in the context of mucosal immunity in gonorrhea human samples."

support the research program of the Jones group."
10982442,"Background. Medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) prevents overdoses and improves mortality in
Veterans with OUD, but retention on MOUD is critical for achieving those clinical endpoints. Only 50% of
Veterans are retained on MOUD at 6-months post-MOUD initiation. Poor engagement in additional needed
care services is an important risk factor for early MOUD discontinuation. Consequently, providers’ ability to
identify Veterans in need of additional care or support while on MOUD may increase the likelihood of Veterans’
continued use of MOUD. Valid predictive models can provide an accurate probability of an individual Veteran
experiencing the outcome being modeled (e.g., MOUD discontinuation). Prediction of future MOUD
discontinuation risk could provide an innovative and real-time method for identifying Veterans in need of
additional care (e.g., peer support). Significance/Impact. Predictive models could be used to lower MOUD
attrition risk and improve outcomes for this Veteran population by continuously monitoring their risk of MOUD
discontinuation in real-time during active MOUD treatment and identifying those Veterans in need of additional
care (e.g., if increasing risk between visits, providers might add peer support services to a treatment plan).
Innovation. This CDA-2 encompasses three HSR&D research priority areas (opioid/pain, health care
informatics, and access to care) while crosscutting HSR methods of “big” data and implementation science, all
in an effort to improve care and outcomes for Veterans with OUD. This study will also be the first to develop
and pilot test a clinical decision support tool (CDST), based on a predictive model, to improve Veterans’ MOUD
retention. Specific Aims. (1) To develop and validate PREMMOUD, a PREdictive Model for MOUD
discontinuation. Hypotheses: (H1) I will develop a predictive model with good discrimination (e.g., c-statistic, a
measure of goodness-of-fit, ≥0.8) for identifying Veterans likely to discontinue MOUD within the initial 6 months
of treatment; (H2) the model generated using neural network techniques will have better discrimination than the
models generated using random forest and logistic regression techniques. (2) To adapt PREMMOUD into a
CDST to continuously monitor risk of MOUD discontinuation and provide clinical guidelines for addressing the
primary risk factors driving the PREMMOUD score. (3) To assess (a) the feasibility of conducting a large scale,
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test PREMMOUD CDST’s (P-CDST) effectiveness as well as (b) P-
CDST’s acceptability among waivered providers. Hypotheses: (H3) The feasibility of conducting a large-scale
RCT to evaluate P-CDST’s effectiveness will be supported; (H4) P-CDST will be acceptable among VHA
waivered providers. Methodology. Using machine-learning methods and data from the VHA Corporate Data
Warehouse (2006-2019), I will train and validate PREMMOUD in a national sample of Veterans initiating
MOUD (Aim 1). For Aim 2, I will conduct two rounds of focus groups with key stakeholders (VHA providers,
Veterans receiving MOUD, VHA operations partners) to inform the creation of a beta-version of P-CDST to be
integrated into CPRS/Cerner. To build P-CDST, I will use VHA CDW data, PREMMOUD, SQL Server
Reporting Services (SSRS) and the Business Intelligence Service Line (BISL) platform. P-CDST will contain
the patient’s real-time PREMMOUD score as well as clinical guidelines to support the provider in addressing
the Veteran’s specific risk factors driving the PREMMOUD score. For Aim 3, I will conduct a single-arm, two-
site pilot trial to assess study feasibility (provider enrollment, frequency of P-CDST use, and follow-up rates)
and P-CDST’s acceptability (clinical usability of P-CDST). Implementation/Next Steps. Aim 1 will support an
HSR&D IIR submission in Year 3 to assess whether PREMMOUD can be used to identify which Veterans,
receiving MOUD, can effectively be treated in specialty care versus non-specialty care and which Veterans
benefit from additional supportive services. A second IIR proposal will be submitted post CDA-2 to conduct an
RCT, using a hybrid design, to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation potential of P-CDST in VHA."

Recent advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatic methodologies have enabled
great progress in better understanding RNA processing, regulation and modification. RNA
editing is a prevalent type of RNA modification where the RNA sequences are altered through
insertion, deletion or substitution of nucleotides. In mammals, the most common type of RNA
editing is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing. A-to-I editing is essential for normal life and
development. A handful of A-to-I editing sites have been discovered with critical roles in
neuronal signaling, by modulating membrane excitability, neurotransmission plasticity and signal
transduction. In addition, aberrant RNA editing has been implicated in human neuropsychiatric
diseases, such as Autism, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, schizophrenia, and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. While numerous RNA editing sites have been identified via RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) and related technologies, major challenges exist in understanding the function and
regulation of RNA editing. The vast majority of known human RNA editing sites reside in non-
coding regions, such as introns and untranslated regions, that may confer regulatory function to
the related gene, especially at the level of post-transcriptional regulation. Therefore, there is a
great demand for in-depth studies of the functional impacts of RNA editing on post-
transcriptional regulation. The regulatory mechanisms of RNA editing are poorly characterized.
Except the ADAR enzymes, few proteins and their mechanisms of action have been examined
for RNA editing. A major challenge is the lack of efficient and systematic methods to pinpoint
novel regulators. In this project, we propose to extend our recent success at developing
bioinformatic and experimental frameworks to address the above challenges. We will capitalize
on the large collection of RNA-seq data sets derived from postmortem brain samples. We will
develop and apply novel methodologies to make full use of these data sets, complemented by
further bioinformatic prediction and high-throughput experimental testing, to predict and validate
the molecular function of RNA editing and related regulatory mechanisms. This work will allow a
previously unattained level of understanding of the molecular basis of RNA editing and provide
new insights to the involvement of RNA editing in human biology."
10982588,"Extreme temperature, humidity, and particulate air pollution are threats to human health, the frequency of
intense exposure to these threats is increasing, and their combination particularly impacts aging populations
and those with chronic health conditions. To combat these challenges, we propose establishing a new center at
Brown University, “Climate, Health, and Aging Innovation and Research Solutions for Communities (CHAIRS-
C),” to advance science on the adverse health implications of climate events and develop actionable solutions
to promote healthy aging for all. CHAIRS-C will be comprised of an Administrative Core, Research Project,
Capacity Building Core, and Community Engagement Core, all designed to efficiently bring together a breadth
of existing and emerging climate and aging research with critical community partners. The long-term objectives
of CHAIRS-C are to enhance relationships between Brown University and community partners and strengthen
interdisciplinary research among existing campus-based units. CHAIRS-C intends to be a national leader in
understanding the impacts of climate change on older adults and proposing innovative interventions to mitigate
these harmful effects. To achieve these long-term objectives, CHAIRS-C has identified the following specific
aims: 1) Strengthening and expanding multi-directional engagement of academic, community-led, and
governmental partners around climate-related risks and accessible mitigations for aging populations; 2)
Developing new capacity for transdisciplinary research and community engagement in climate and health
through shared learning experiences, focused on aging populations; and 3) Sharing findings from best-
available exposure modeling and place-based health datasets with community and governmental partners to
stimulate actionable, localized responses, particularly for high-risk subgroups facing disparities. The basic
tenet of CHAIRS-C is that innovative solutions require partnerships between communities and researchers to
generate the appropriate evidence and political will to guide effective and efficient solutions. Neither research
nor community action is effective alone. To mitigate the adverse implications of climate change, we must
collaborate. CHAIRS-C will merge these approaches to benefit older adults, setting a new standard that will be
applicable to other populations facing inequity and health threats related to climate change."
10985624,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) is a regenerative state that leads to repair of the pancreas
after injury. During ADM, acinar cells transdifferentiate to a duct-like cell and become
proliferative. ADM is typically reversible; however, ADM is also a risk factor for the development
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Activating mutations in KRAS lead to persistent ADM and
progression to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and cancer. Many studies describe
how cell metabolism is reprogrammed in cancer, though little is known about the role of
metabolism in regulating precancerous stages, like ADM and PanIN. I hypothesize that 1. cell
metabolism is altered in ADM to upregulate redox homeostasis, and 2. healthy acinar cells
maintain a metabolic microenvironment that is restrictive for ADM and PanIN progression.
Previous work shows that genes for NADPH-producing enzymes, Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6pd) and Malic enzyme 1 (Me1) are upregulated during ADM to maintain
redox homeostasis and glutathione recycling. Preliminary also suggest that glutathione
biosynthesis pathways are necessary for controlled ADM development. Aim 1 will
mechanistically focus on Me1 and determine how Me1-loss contributes to ADM and PanIN
formation. The experiments proposed in Aim 1 use genetically engineered mouse models of
pancreatic cancer, steady-state metabolomics, isotope tracing, and ex vivo primary acinar cell
culture. Aim 2 will address if altered glutathione biosynthesis promotes ADM formation. It will
interrogate if blocking cystine import (via loss of a subunit of the system xC– antiporter) and a
rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis increases reactive oxygen species in the cell and
promotes ADM. Aim 3 (R00 focus) will determine if healthy acinar cells contribute to a restrictive
environment for the development of ADM and PanIN, even when oncogenic Kras is present.
Preliminary experiments suggest that healthy acinar cells secrete metabolites to inhibit adjacent
cells from undergoing ADM. Pilot spatial transcriptomic experiments have also identified
potential metabolic genes important for ADM restriction. This aim uses inducible mouse models
of Kras-driven pancreatic cancer, metabolomics, and spatial transcriptomics. Together, the aims
presented in this proposal will provide new mechanistic insights on how metabolic pathways
control the formation of precancerous states in the pancreas."
10985656,"ABSTRACT
 Auto brewery syndrome (ABS), also known as gut fermentation syndrome, is a rare condition in which a
dysfunctional intestinal microbiome produces ethanol, which is absorbed and results in intoxication. ABS may
result in behavioral, familial, social, and legal problems and is difficult to diagnose in part because of its rarity,
and because alcohol use disorder is common. Patients typically have “flares” of the condition, with episodes of
inebriation. ABS may be caused by yeast, sometimes brewer’s yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but it may
also be associated with bacteria, such as Klebsiella species, E. coli or others, sometimes in combination. We
recruited 38 ABS patients and their household partners (HHP). Preliminary data showed that anaerobic
bioreactor cultures of ABS patient microbiota produced ex vivo significantly more ethanol than that of HHP.
Ethanol production was abrogated by antibiotic treatment. Metagenomic analysis of fecal samples showed higher
proportions of several bacterial species and of genomic DNA encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in stool of
patients with ABS as compared with HHP. These findings indicate that pathologic production of ethanol is driven
by gut bacteria in most ABS patients. We have safely treated one ABS patient with an active flare using capsule
fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) under a single patient treatment IND. The patient achieved clinical
remission. We hypothesize that FMT in ABS patients is safe, tolerable and may result in an eradication of alcohol
producing microbes. We therefore propose a phase 1, open label safety and feasibility study of capsule-based
FMT in subjects with ABS under FDA and IRB supervision. Primary clinical outcomes are safety and feasibility;
secondary and exploratory endpoints include clinical outcomes and assessment of flares by blood and
breathalyzer ethanol monitoring, dietary intake, and microbiome and bioreactor assessment of stool samples.
These studies may reveal a new and safe therapeutic approach for patients with ABS, and will improve our
understanding of how gut microbial ethanol production contributes to the disease. Results from this safety and
tolerability study may lead to the conduct of a larger randomized controlled clinical trial for FMT use in patients
with ABS. The study may also inform our understanding of the effect of the microbiome on other hepatic and
metabolic disorders."

Deficient sleep aggravates negative mood and reduces self-control and represents a primary withdrawal
symptom and robust predictor of relapse in adults who smoke. We propose to investigate how cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) ameliorates negative emotions, improves self-control, and promotes
cessation and to identify the neural markers of the effects of CBT-I among individuals who smoke.
 Nicotine influences the brain through its action on cholinergic systems. Cholinergic innervations of the
cerebral cortex arise primarily from the basal nucleus of Meynert (BNM) in the forebrain. With reciprocal
connection with the medial frontal cortex (MFC), the BNM respond vigorously to salient stimuli, e.g., drug cues,
to obtain reward and MFC inhibition of the BNM interrupts the impulsive response. As a hub that regulates
sleep-wake cycle and motivated behavior, the hypothalamus is heavily connected with the BNM as well as
hippocampal limbic circuits. Thus, hypothalamus dysfunction may associate sleep deficiency with negative
emotion and impaired control in adults who smoke. Our over-arching hypothesis is that CBT-I ameliorates
negative emotions, improves self-control, and promotes smoking cessation by remediating hypothalamus and
BNM circuit dysfunction.
 We build on our preliminary findings of CBT-I and imaging studies and propose to recruit a cohort of 114
treatment-seeking adults who smoke to test this hypothesis. Participants will be stratified to a CBT group
receiving standard care (i.e., counseling + varenicline) + CBT-I or a standard care (SC) group with SC only.
Treatment will start 4 weeks (lead-in period) prior to a scheduled quit date. All participants will undergo MRI at
baseline and at week 4 to probe attentional bias and response inhibition during exposure to smoking vs.
neutral cues and to probe negative emotion processing. Participants then continue to receive their assigned
treatment for 4 more weeks (quit period) and attend follow-ups at week 8, 12, and 26. Our aims are 1) to
examine baseline associations among clinical measures of sleep deficiency, task performance (attentional bias
and response inhibition to smoking cues, reaction time in negative emotion processing), and neural metrics
(BNM and hypothalamus circuit activities and connectivities); 2) to examine the effects of CBT-I on clinical,
task, and neural outcomes; and 3) to examine whether CBT vs. SC results in superior cessation outcomes,
including higher biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence quit rates at week 8, and how self-control and
emotion processing at week 4 quit date predict week 8 cessation outcomes.
 By investigating the effects of CBT-I on impulse control and emotion processing as well as how the under-
studied basal forebrain and hypothalamic circuit mechanisms may support the benefits of CBT-I in adults who
smoke, the study will advance both the neuroscience and treatment of tobacco use disorders."

Expanded Medicare coverage for telehealth services during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE) has
removed many of the barriers to telehealth provision in nursing homes (NHs). For NH residents with
Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias (ADRD), who make up over 60 per cent of NH
residents, increased telehealth provision may allow more timely access to specialty care at the end of life
(EOL) and provide clinicians and caregivers with an important layer of audiovisual information to make
informed patient-centered decisions. However, EOL care is highly variable across NHs and there are
substantial disparities in the quality of EOL care associated with race/ethnicity and socioeconomic
disadvantage. For example, residents who are racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to complete advance
care planning and are more likely to die in a hospital. It is not clear how telehealth may impact these
disparities. Additionally, there may be unintended consequences and challenges of telehealth provision for
residents with ADRD. Over three years after the start of the PHE, the expansion and phase out of telehealth
flexibilities requires a careful evaluation of its capacity to impact the quality, utilization, and cost of care for NH
residents. The overall objectives of this study are to leverage the natural experiments surrounding changes in
Medicare telehealth benefits to examine changes in access to telehealth for NH residents with ADRD and in
the last 90 days of life. We will focus on the following specific aims to achieve these objectives: (1) To
characterize patterns of telehealth provision at the EOL for NH residents with ADRD, including the overall and
relative rates of telehealth to in-person services; (2) To evaluate the extent to which access to telehealth
mediates the relationship between resident race/ethnicity, dual-eligibility, and rurality of the NH, and the use of
specialized medical care at the EOL; and (3) To measure the relationship between telehealth provision and the
quality and cost of care at the EOL for NH residents with ADRD, overall and by race/ethnicity, dual-eligibility,
and rurality. This application is innovative because it leverages a quasi-experimental approach to estimate the
effect of telehealth use, with a focus on the extent to which telehealth may impact disparities in EOL care for
residents with ADRD. This project it will be the first to measure telehealth use in NHs for both Medicare FFS
beneficiaries and residents enrolled in MA, who constitute over 25% of long-stay NH residents. The proposed
research is significant because as coverage for many telehealth services are set to expire December 2024, this
study will shed light on the potential impacts of reducing access to telehealth for NH residents and individuals
with ADRD. This project will also importantly inform NIH goals for expanded research on the use and efficacy
of telehealth to improve the delivery of care for people living with ADRD."
10985248,"Lewy-body dementia (LBD) is a neurodegenerative illness and the most common of a spectrum of Parkinsonian disorders called Parkinson’s and related disorders (PDRD). Notably, Lewy-body dementia has been specifically named by NIH as an Alzheimer’s and Related disorder (ADRD) and an area of high priority research. LBD includes Dementia with Lewy bodies, an illness characterized by early dementia, hallucinations and parkinsonism, and Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, an occurrence that affects over 75% of people with Parkinson’s and the leading cause of carepartner distress in this population. Despite this, carepartner support for LBD is not routinely addressed in current models of care, even when compared to other ADRDs. When it is addressed, the focus is on carepartner burden reduction. Support is likely to be incomplete, and possibly even harmful, when provided solely through a burden lens especially as carepartners themselves believe that there are positive aspects of caregiving and that it can be fulfilling. Providing adequate carepartner support is challenging without knowledge of carepartners’ views on caregiving and what matters to them. Stakeholder engagement research methods offer an important way to address this knowledge gap. The long-term goal is to use stakeholder engagement research methods to partner with carepartners and multidisciplinary teams and develop, test, and promote interventions and programs that promote balanced and carepartner-driven approaches to carepartner support. This proposal’s research objectives are to identify the dimensions and positive and negative aspects of LBD caregiving, adapt and co-design a peer-led intervention for this population, and conduct a pilot clinical trial. An intervention developed with LBD carepartners that goes beyond burden can improve carepartner preparedness, and wellbeing, and decrease social isolation. This is based on evidence from peer-led interventions in other diseases that have channeled the experiences and motivation of former carepartners to successfully address current carepartner concerns. This proposal has three specific aims: (1) Identify dimensions of LBD caregiving by collaborating with key stakeholders, (2) Adapt & design a peer-led pilot intervention for and with LBD carepartners, and (3) Assess feasibility and acceptability of the pilot intervention. The approach is innovative as it is the first within the field of Neurology to (a) identify what matters most to carepartners, (b) use stakeholder engagement research methods from design to delivery of an intervention, and (c) utilize a user centered design framework. The training objectives of this proposal will build on the applicant’s prior research experiences to learn new skills related to (1) Stakeholder Engagement Methods, (2) Intervention Adaptation and co-design, and (3) Design of Clinical Trials."
10985277,"Immunoproteostasis refers to the relationship between the immune system, proteinopathies present in many
neurodegenerative disorders, and brain cell dysfunction. The relevance of immunoproteostasis to Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) is supported by genetic, pathological, and modeling studies. In AD, as in cancer, multiple lines of evidence now
support the benefits of immune activating therapies, but for AD this concept is not settled science. More generally,
manipulation of the immune activation states regardless of “direction”, has potential for harm as well as benefit. The
overarching goal of these studies is to determine whether we can identify immune manipulations in preclinical models of
amyloid pathology that potentially fall within a “Goldilocks zone”- where disease modification, with minimal or no
damage, is achieved. We propose three aims that will test our global hypothesis that it is possible to identify immune
modulatory therapies that fall within a Goldilocks zone. In aim 1, we will systematically evaluate liabilities and benefits of
immune manipulations that have been shown to modulate immunoproteostasis in amyloid depositing mice. In aim 2, we
will survey a broader set of immune manipulations targeting putative microglial immune checkpoints to evaluate whether
a manipulation of any of these checkpoints falls within the Goldilocks zone. In aim 3, we will evaluate whether targeting
of immune modulating factors to the plaque microenvironment can maintain or increase beneficial impact on AD relevant
pathologies while reducing potential liabilities. Several overarching principles provide a framework for these studies. First,
as the balance of positive and negative effects of any immune manipulation may limit therapeutic benefit, we will use
transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, assessments of pathology, and assays of synaptic number and function to assess
disease modifying potential and liabilities more broadly and systematically. Second, we will focus on non-cell autonomous
manipulations of immune signaling pathways, as such studies are more likely to identify translatable interventions. Third,
we will evaluate whether we can increase efficacy and limit liabilities by more precisely targeting the immune
manipulations to the plaque microenvironment. The studies are highly translational, as they can validate novel approaches
to immune modulatory therapies for AD. Finally, these studies have relevance beyond the AD field, as they broadly explore
immune checkpoints in the brain and thus the data generated may inform studies relating to immuno-oncology of the
brain and other neuroimmune disorders."
10990739,"ERAD-STING Crosstalk in Microglia: Unraveling the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease
ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an age-dependent progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most common
form of dementia. Although amyloid- and Tau-mediated proteinopathies are the proposed main drivers, emerging
evidence from both patients and animal models have clearly indicated that the disease is much more complicated
at genetic, molecular and cellular levels. In responding to PAR-22-093, we propose to explore the role of innate
immunity and its new regulatory mechanism in neuroinflammation associated with AD. The MPI team, composed
of the Qi (UVA) and Zhao (USC) laboratories, will investigate the role of STING and its crosstalk with protein
quality-control mechanism known as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) in AD
pathogenesis. The Qi laboratory has been exploring the physiological role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD complex, a
principal mechanism for the recruitment and retro-translocation of misfolded ER proteins for cytosolic
proteasomal degradation for the last 15 years, While the Zhao laboratory has been focused on the role of innate
immunity in neurodegeneration and AD pathogenesis for the past decade. We recently reported independently
that STING is controlled by ERAD at the ER of macrophages (Qi Nat Cell Biol 2023), and that STING activation
in microglia is a major driving force of neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis (Zhao Nat Aging 2023). Recently,
the two teams collaboratively generated strong preliminary data providing further support for the importance of
the ERAD-STING axis in amyloid AD pathologies. Our central hypothesis proposes that chronic activation of
STING-mediated innate immunity in the brain is a fundamental mechanism underlying
neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis, which is regulated by SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD. This study establishes
the pivotal role of innate immunity and its crosstalk with the ER quality control mechanism in AD progression.
We will delineate how this new axis influence the amyloid metabolism, neuroinflammation and AD pathogenesis
in the following aims: (1) Determine the functions of cGAS-STING on amyloid metabolism and
neurodegeneration; (2) Delineate the importance of ERAD-STING crosstalk in AD pathogenesis; and (3) Define
the cellular mechanism for ERAD-STING-mediated neurodegeneration in AD. Hence, this MPI team with
complementary expertise in cell biology/immunology and neuro-/AD-biology will establish the cGAS-STING
pathway as a critical molecular link between innate immunity and AD, and uncover the importance of SEL1L-
HRD1 ERAD as a novel regulator of STING-mediated neuroinflammation in aging and AD.
HUMAN RELEVANCE: A better understanding of this innate immune pathway in CNS inflammation and its
regulatory mechanism will help unveil the complex etiology and heterogeneity in AD, provide novel insights into
novel therapeutic targets for AD and identify potential drug designs targeting the STING innate immune pathway
in AD."

One in two Black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States will acquire HIV in their lifetime, an
inequity that has worsened over time despite Black MSM engaging in fewer sexual risk behaviors, such as
condomless anal sex, than White and Hispanic/Latino MSM. This disparate HIV incidence is especially
prevalent in early adulthood, making it crucial to understand factors surrounding poor sexual health outcomes
of young Black MSM (YBMSM), ages 18-29 years. YBMSM are often impacted by multiple, intersecting
systems of oppression, resulting in intersectional discrimination and a variety of experiences that can adversely
impact their sexual health. The goal of the proposed research and training fellowship is for the applicant to
acquire the skills and expertise necessary to become an independent, mixed methods researcher focused on
sexual health equity among sexual and gender minoritized (SGM) populations. The proposed research and
training will be conducted at the Duke University School of Nursing, supported by Sponsor Dr. Marta Mulawa
and Co-Sponsor Dr. Rosa Gonzalez-Guarda. Specific training goals include advancement of theoretical and
pragmatic knowledge of intersectionality and SGM sexual health, mixed methods integration, and development
of scientific dissemination skills rooted in community engagement. These goals will be accomplished through a
variety of workshops, mentorship activities, and execution of the proposed research that strives to understand
the heterogeneity of intersectional discrimination experiences among YBMSM and their sexual health. This
study’s aims are to: 1) identify latent subgroups of YBMSM with different patterns of intersectional
discrimination experiences due to various reason(s) (race/ethnicity, physical appearance, sexual orientation,
and education/income level); 2) determine the relationship between the identified latent subgroups of
discrimination with latent subgroups of sexual health, determined by multiple indicators (pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness, lifetime PrEP use, lifetime HIV and STI testing, recent STI testing, and
condomless insertive and receptive sex); and 3) contextualize how intersectional discrimination experiences
may shape sexual health among purposively sampled YBMSM participants (n = 20) based on identified
discrimination subgroups, using semi-structured individual interviews. To achieve these aims, an explanatory
sequential (QUAN à qual) mixed methods design will be used, analyzing data from a subsample of YBMSM
ages 18-29 from a large dataset (R01MD013623), which will inform subsequent in-depth interviews. By
combining quantitative and qualitative strands of data, the proposed study will thoroughly examine and
contextualize the variation in YBMSM experiences with discrimination and sexual health, providing a critical
foundation for future tailored interventions focused on mitigating sexual health inequities. The sexual health
equity focus of this study closely aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s mission, focusing on
sexual health promotion, including HIV prevention, in the context of YBMSM population health."
11001665,"The centromere is a unique chromosomal region that is essential for high-fidelity chromosome transmission
during cell division. In mitosis, microtubules attached to the kinetochore help ensure the faithful segregation of
sister chromatids into daughter cells. Our goal is to understand the mechanisms that govern centromere function.
Centromere identity relies on the deposition of the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, CENP-A but not on
specific DNA sequences. After DNA replication, “old” centromeric nucleosomes are transferred onto the newly
replicated chromatids. In mammals, deposition of CENP-A occurs in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The
mechanisms of CENP-A deposition and maintenance are crucial for proper centromere inheritance and function
but remain to be delineated. We recently found that EWSR1 (Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1) is required
for CENP-A deposition and maintenance at the centromere. We show that EWSR1 and EWSR1-FLI1 (the
oncogenic fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma) bind to CENP-A through the SYGQ2 region within its prion-like
domain known to be important for phase separation. We found that EWSR1 is required for CENP-A deposition
at the centromere. CENP-A is associated with centromeric RNA, which is important for centromere function. We
demonstrate that EWSR1 plays a key role in promoting this association. We also have biochemical evidence
that EWSR1 binds R-loops, a three-stranded RNA-DNA hybrid, through its RNA-recognition motif. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that EWSR1 plays crucial roles in maintaining centromere structure and function
by binding RNA and anchoring CENP-A in centromeric chromatin. We will test this hypothesis. Aim 1: To
determine the function of EWSR1 and RNA/R-loops in centromere maintenance. We generated EWSR1
conditional KO cells using an AID (auxin-inducible degron) system, which allows us to remove EWSR1 upon
auxin addition. We will test if auxin-induced degradation of EWSR1 abolishes CENP-A signals at the centromere
at different cell cycle stages. We will induce the expression of SETX, which clears RNA-DNA hybrids, at different
cell cycle stages to ask whether centromeric RNA/R-loops are required for CENP-A maintenance at the
centromere. Aim 2: To investigate the function of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. We will generate EWSR1 mutants
defective in binding to CENP-A by introducing mutations into the SYGQ2 region of EWSR1. We will examine the
phenotypes of the EWSR1 KO cells expressing CENP-A binding deficient mutants. We will also identify the
EWSR1-binding domain of CENP-A. We will then isolate CENP-A mutants impaired for EWSR1 binding. We will
express Flag-tagged mutants in CENP-A KO cells to examine the localization of CENP-A and the phenotypes of
the mutant cells. We will investigate if EWSR1 association with CENP-A is unique for interphase. We will
investigate the mechanism that regulates cell cycle specificity of EWSR1-CENP-A interaction. Aim 3: To test if
EWSR1 anchors CENP-A at the centromere via RNA binding. To test this model, we will directly examine this
model by constructing and testing CENP-A and EWSR1 variants with engineered functional domains."
11001681,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Across all life, gene expression depends upon the faithful and timely transcription of messenger RNAs by RNA
polymerase. The molecular details of RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongation have been determined for enzymes
from a few species, but it is unclear whether these examples are representative of the whole. Recently, RNAP
from the model gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis was found to be uncoupled from translation and travel
at a much faster rate than RNAP from its gram-negative counterpart, Escherichia coli. This observation is
complemented by known differences in transcriptional regulation between these species. I hypothesize that
because many mechanisms of gene regulation act upon elongating RNAP, changes in elongation rate will
affect how this regulation occurs. The goal of my proposal is to determine the causes of elongation rate
divergence between B. subtilis and E. coli and to examine the roles of B. subtilis RNAP-associated factors in
co-transcriptional gene regulation. Because pausing is a major determinant of RNAP elongation rate in vivo, in
Aim 1 of my proposal I will determine differences in pausing between B. subtilis and E. coli using nascent RNA
sequencing. In Aim 2, I will examine intrinsic and trans factors affecting B. subtilis and E. coli RNAP elongation
rate in vitro using single-molecule microscopy. In Aim 3, I will establish functions of B. subtilis RNAP-
associated factors with a genetic interaction screen. This work will illuminate the idiosyncrasies of B. subtilis
transcriptional machinery, which are likely shared by other Firmicutes bacteria including the pathogens S.
aureus and C. difficile. Because RNAP is an established antibiotic target, understanding differences in RNAP
function across bacteria could inform the development of novel species-specific antibiotics.
My fellowship training plan combines the knowledge and experience of my sponsors, Dr. Gene-Wei Li and Dr.
Jeff Gelles, to facilitate my research and career goals. Dr. Li has a strong background in quantitative biology

skills in this area. Dr. Gelles has also mentored several post-doctoral trainees that have obtained independent
research positions. The support of my sponsors in combination with the research infrastructure and career
opportunities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will facilitate the completion of the research aims in
this proposal and my development as an independent scientist."

African Americans have disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US. African Americans
with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have twice the risk than non-Hispanic whites for developing CVD. Poorer sleep
and greater chronic psychological stress may contribute to this additional risk. Consequently, African
Americans have worse glycemic control among those with diabetes and higher CVD risk. One promising
approach to improving CVD risk in African Americans is mindfulness meditation (MM). MM can potentially
reduce cardiovascular risk through attention control, emotional regulation, and self-awareness. The overall
purpose of this K01 training grant is for Dr. Alana Biggers to obtain research training and develop skills needed
to become an independent investigator and use those skills to adapt and evaluate an established MM
curriculum (Mindfulness Based Therapy for Insomnia, or MBT-I). The specific aims are to: (1) adapt and refine
the MBT-I curriculum for African-Americans with T2DM and incorporate text messaging; (2) conduct an 8-
week, pilot randomized, controlled trial of the adapted curriculum with 68 African-Americans with T2DM; and
(3) explore the impact of the intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, glycosylated
hemoglobin, and lipid profile) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor
necrosis factor α). Primary outcomes will include sleep quality and perceived stress evaluated at baseline, 8,
and 16 weeks. The proposed research design consists of a pilot study, utilizes mixed-methods research, and
involves both primary data collection and analysis. This K01 training grant provides Dr. Biggers career-building
activities to further develop skills and a knowledge base in quantitative and qualitative methodology, health
disparities research, and mobile health (mHealth)/behavioral health strategies in minority populations. With the
guidance of an interdisciplinary mentorship team and institutional support, Dr. Biggers receives the necessary
assistance and training to work toward her long-term career goal of being an independent researcher with
expertise in health disparities, mixed-methods, and mHealth behavioral research."
10993741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing may be particularly beneficial in patients who visit the emergency
department (ED) because most presenting patients are experiencing significant problems related to their
disease and/or associated medication(s). Moreover, most of the patients visiting the ED will either be admitted
to the hospital or receive follow-up outpatient care in the near future. Our long-term goal is to identify patient
populations where precision medicine can improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The overall
objective of this application is to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and economic impact of clinically
implementing PGx testing, with appropriate prescribing decision support, in the ED setting. The central
hypothesis is that providing such an intervention will reduce ED return visits and thus healthcare costs. The
rationale for the proposed research is that PGx results, with appropriate prescribing decision support, should
empower prescribers to further individualize their medication prescribing, which should decrease the rate of
medication ineffectiveness and side effects.
 We plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of this application by pursuing
three specific aims. The first aim is to expand PGx-based decision support resources for clinicians in the
emergency and post-emergency settings. We will accomplish this aim by expanding PGx decision support to
include drug-drug-gene interactions, pharmacist medication reviews, additional gene-drug pairs, and
expanding prescribing recommendations to outside the health system will increase clinical uptake of precision
medicine. The second aim is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing PGx testing in
high-risk patients who frequently visit the emergency department. We will accomplish this aim by completing a
randomized, pragmatic clinical trial comparing high-risk ED patients receiving PGx testing to those receiving
usual care. We will assess ED return rates, hospitalization rates, as well as key implementation metrics. The
third aim is to quantify the cost-effectiveness and net benefit associated with implementation of PGx testing
given various levels of emergency department return rate reduction. We will accomplish this aim with three
analyses first estimating the cost-effectiveness of this approach and then comparing the cost-benefit using
cost-per-(averted) revisit as the main outcome and comparing intervention to usual care.
 The proposed research is significant because it should help to identify methods to improve care while
reducing costs and address multiple established barriers to PGx implementation. The proposed research is
innovative because it will research an understudied, yet at-risk patient population. Ultimately, we expect to
have important effectiveness, feasibility, and economic data regarding expanding precision medicine efforts in
the ED setting. These results should have a positive impact by informing future clinical implementation efforts
and larger multi-site clinical trials, ideally reducing both cost and medication-related healthcare disparities."

 During adolescence the brain undergoes dramatic changes that coincide with a major transition in social-
emotional behaviors and is a time of enhanced vulnerability for individuals with a host of neurodevelopmental
and neurobehavioral disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders. One brain region that
is a major driver of the behavioral transition during adolescence is the amygdala. The amygdala is critical for
social-emotional behavior and altered developmental trajectories and dysfunction of the amygdala are hallmark
features of many neurodevelopment and neurobehavioral disorders. Here, we focus on the role played by the
transcription factor, Foxp2, in behavioral and circuit maturation of the medial subnucleus of the amygdala during
adolescence in both males and females. Our focus on Foxp2 stems from our previous work and work in the field
highly implicating Foxp2 gene function in social brain function and critical periods of neurodevelopment. These
findings led to our hypothesis that Foxp2 is required in a sex-specific manner for the formation of social
circuitry in the medial subnucleus of the amygdala during adolescence.
 To study the function of Foxp2 in behavior and circuit maturation during adolescence, we will use cutting
edge CRISPR-Cas gene editing approaches to delete Foxp2 gene function in male and female mice specifically
in the medial amygdala during adolescence. We will examine the consequences on social behavior and neuronal
circuit function (Specific Aim 1), and using state of the art genomic profiling tools, uncover the correlate gene
regulatory deficits underlying these behavioral and circuit deficits (Specific Aim 2). The overarching goal of this
project is to generate a mechanistic understanding of the genetic control of social brain formation and social
behavior during adolescence. As amygdala dysfunction is a prime feature of a host of social and emotional
disorders, most of which show sex biases, this work is a critical step toward understanding how brain circuit
dysfunction is linked to prevalent human disorders."

The proposed study will conduct a detailed examination of the impact of ableism on women with intellectual
and developmental disabilities (I/DD) during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and will compare outcomes
experienced by this group and their infants to those of peers without I/DD. Despite the growing number of
individuals with I/DD giving birth and the substantial health needs and comorbidities present in this population,
very little is known about the impact of ableism on healthcare access and service use among women with I/DD
in the periods before and after delivery. Examining the healthcare experiences of these women in the Medicaid
system in the US is a critical starting point. Medicaid funds almost half of births in the US and is among the
only healthcare coverage options available to birthing people with disabilities including I/DD, most of whom do
not have access to employer-sponsored health insurance. In addition, the Medicaid beneficiary population is
diverse and includes birthing people from higher maternal risk groups, including Black women and women from
other racial/ethnic minority groups who are disproportionately impacted by mental health diagnoses and
maternal morbidity and mortality. We propose to use the latest available national Medicaid claims data (2016-
2023) to identify women with I/DD between 14 and 50 years of age who have given birth and are at risk for
experiencing ableism and link them to their infants, who are also typically enrolled in Medicaid. We will
compare pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum health outcomes among women with I/DD compared to women
without I/DD. By linking these women to their infants, we will assess the impact of ableism on neonatal and
post-natal health outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. We will also link Medicaid information to other key data
sources, including Census-based indicators of community-level social determinants of health and state
Medicaid policy data to identify structural ableism and opportunities for systemic intervention. Using Medicaid-
generated data that identifies service providers and designing data collection instruments aimed at assessing
ableism, we will then survey and interview obstetric service providers to identify how attitudinal ableism
impacts barriers and facilitators to service delivery and potentially modifiable components of healthcare
access, referral, and service delivery (e.g., training, preparedness, communication) that may moderate the
relationship between I/DD status and outcomes during pregnancy and postpartum. The information generated
by this study is essential to identifying opportunities to address attitudinal and structural ableism to improve the
system of care to meet the needs of the growing group of birthing women with I/DD and support outcomes for
their infants. Completion of this study will result in the most substantive national work to date to identify
modifiable policy, system, and provider factors to mitigate the impact of ableism and support improved
outcomes for women with I/DD during the pregnancy and postpartum periods and their babies, with the goal of
reducing observed adverse pregnancy and postpartum outcomes among women from underserved groups."

proposed modern equipment will aid in the consistency and accuracy of animal care through improved
environmental sustainability and automation of animal facility operation. The latter is to provide the Laboratory
Animal Research Core facility with a cloud storage and web-based system to replace the current system that is
limited to a local server and can only be accessed in the office of the core director and not elsewhere in the core
facility or the institution. Further, it will enable core staff to monitor environmental conditions from any computer
improving both efficiency of operations and increased responsiveness to animal care needs and users, as well
as enable core staff to more effectively and quickly communicate with the university’s Central Facilities
Management team to control more readily environmental conditions. The modern equipment will enable
detection, measurement, monitoring, recording, and reporting environmental extrinsic factors to allow
experiments reproducibly conducted under similar environmental conditions and animal care, husbandry
settings. The novel and modern equipment will take advantage of existing resources while allowing core staff to
detect, monitor, quantify, record, analyze in real-time and report these factors and allow for the longitudinal
assessment of environmental factors, a capability that currently does not exist for the core and that a routine
upgrade would not be able to accomplish. The proposed systems will serve a diverse and increasing community
of NIH-funded researchers at UMKC meeting the current increased and future needs for biomedical research,
as well as modernize training in health-related research. The proposed equipment will accelerate research
progress and enhance the rigor, quality and breadth of research results and generate data of the highest impact
possible. Overall, these advancements will allow NIH-funded UMKC investigators active in biomedical research
conduct research on diseases that affect significant and increasing portions of the U.S. population including
minorities affected by disparities in health care delivery, to determine the underlying causes of human disease,
help design future therapeutics and improve health care."

The nuclear envelope is a distinct domain of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that serves to surround and protect
the genome. The unique identity of the nuclear envelope is determined by a subset of integral membrane proteins
that execute its distinct functions. After each open mitosis, the nuclear envelope must regain its identity as it
forms from ER-derived membranes. In the current funding period, we showed that regulation of the phosphatidic
acid phosphatase lipin by the nuclear envelope-enriched protein phosphatase CTDNEP1 restricts ER membrane
biogenesis, maintains the lipid composition of the nuclear envelope and contributes to the sealing, size and
protein identity of nuclear envelope. In this project, we want to understand how the lipid composition of the
nuclear envelope is established to control its formation and functions. Our proposed work uses vertebrate tissue
culture cells to define (1) how CTDNEP1 itself is targeted to the nuclear envelope to establish the lipid content
and promote the formation of the nuclear envelope, (2) how local lipid metabolism orchestrates membrane
remodeling during nuclear formation and (3) how membrane sensing by nuclear envelope-associated proteins
contributes to the formation and function of the nuclear envelope. Aim 1 will characterize the nanoscale
organization of CTDNEP1 at the nuclear rim and determine the mechanism that promotes its selective targeting,
retention and stabilization at nuclear envelope subdomains. This will determine how CTDNEP1 recognizes the
nuclear envelope to drive lipid identity. To understand how lipid metabolism in turn controls nuclear envelope
formation, we will determine the lipid species (eg head group and acyl chain composition) necessary for nuclear
membrane remodeling using lipid biosensors, advanced imaging, lipidomics, and candidate screens of lipid
modifying enzymes. Aim 2 builds on our preliminary data in which we uncovered putative membrane-targeting
amphipathic helices (AHs) in known and previously uncharacterized nuclear envelope-associated proteins. We
will directly follow up on two proteins with membrane binding amphipathic helices to determine the significance
of membrane binding to their functions at the nuclear envelope. We will also complete the screen to determine
the putative amphipathic helices for each protein that bind membranes in vitro and the inner nuclear membrane
in vivo. This will allow us to determine if there is a unique, shared code for inner nuclear membrane binding via
amphipathic helices. The completion of this work will elucidate how a unique lipid composition in established at
the nuclear envelope and how the distinct functions of the nuclear envelope are modulated by lipid metabolism.
Defects in the formation of the nuclear envelope from ER-derived membranes leads to genome damage common
to cancer. Mutations in nuclear envelope proteins cause human dystrophies including muscular dystrophy and
progeria. Thus, an understanding of how the nuclear envelope establishes and maintains its distinct structure
and identity will inform on mechanisms of diseases that range from cancer to accelerated aging."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant
developmental, intellectual, and behavioral impairments. Patients with ASD exhibit comorbid conditions and
common features shared with epilepsy and intellectual disability (ID), suggesting an overlapping underlying
etiology for these disorders. Human genetic studies have been extremely fruitful in identifying risk genes
implicated in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. One large group of such genes encodes chromatin
remodeling proteins, while another encompasses synaptic molecules. Although it is known that chromatin
remodelers are important for neuronal cell differentiation and development, the manner in which their abnormal
activities affect synaptic function remains unclear. Synapses are highly dynamic, yet their electrical properties
are stabilized within a physiological range throughout life by mechanisms of synaptic homeostatic plasticity.
Dysregulation of synaptic homeostatic plasticity can lead to an imbalance of excitation and inhibition within neural
networks, which is associated with chronic neurological disorders. Understanding how chromatin remodeling
proteins and synaptic proteins functionally converge to control synaptic homeostatic plasticity - and how
dysregulation of these proteins contributes to increased ASD susceptibility at molecular and cellular levels - is
crucial. De novo Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in the human Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein
2 (CHD2) have been associated with ASD, epilepsy, ID, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
We have discovered that Chd1, the Drosophila homolog of mammalian CHD2, is essential for presynaptic
homeostatic plasticity. Interestingly, Chd1 expressed in different cell types exhibits distinct roles in the rapid
induction and long-term maintenance of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Through an electrophysiology-based
genetic screen, we have identified multiple downstream target genes of Chd1 that are critical for presynaptic
homeostatic plasticity. This proposal seeks to investigate how Chd1-controlled downstream signaling pathways
are functionally integrated both temporally and spatially within synaptic homeostatic plasticity. Furthermore, we
aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which human disease variants in CHD2 impact synaptic physiology and
homeostatic plasticity. Employing a multifaceted approach that includes genetic tools, electrophysiological
methods, super-resolution imaging, transcriptomics, and computational analyses, we will systematically
delineate the signaling domains regulated by Chd1 and generate a comprehensive understanding of the Chd1-
dependent signaling network that stabilizes synaptic function."
10981898,"Obesity remains a major health problem in US and causes metabolic complications such as
diabetes, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Similar complications also occur in patients with
autoimmune lipodystrophies characterized by almost complete (acquired generalized
lipodystrophy or AGL) or partial (acquired partial lipodystrophy, APL) loss of body fat. Recently,
circulating autoantibody against perilipin-1 (PLIN1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
AGL. However, nearly two-thirds of AGL patients do not have PLIN1 autoantibodies suggesting
other adipocyte antigens may be involved in the autoimmune response. Furthermore, the
pathogenesis of APL remains unknown. Thus, the first two aims of this proposal are to identify
additional autoantibodies against adipocyte expressed proteins that cause AGL or APL and to
determine their function in adipocyte biology. We will use two state-of-the-art complementary
techniques, a. Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) Assay and b. Human
Proteome Microarray (HuProtTM version 4 Chip) to identify the serum autoantibodies in AGL and
APL patients. Our recent data from a mouse model of human autoimmune polyglandular
syndrome type 1)(Aire-/- mice) reveal circulating PLIN1 autoantibodies and loss of both
subcutaneous and visceral fat due to inflammatory lesions in adipose tissue. Therefore, the third
aim of our proposal is to determine underlying autoimmune mechanisms involved in loss of
tolerance to perilipin-1 in Aire-/- mice. Lastly, we will determine pathogenicity of novel
autoantibodies discovered in patients with AGL and APL against adipocyte expressed proteins
by infusing them into mice and evaluating loss of body fat, development of insulin resistance and
metabolic derangements. These studies will unravel autoimmune mechanisms involved in
causation of lipodystrophy, and insulin resistance and its associated morbidities. This new
knowledge may provide targets for developing novel drugs for treating diabetes, dyslipidemias
and hepatic steatosis."

The overall objective of the work supported by this grant has been to develop therapies to treat, delay, or
prevent Type 1 diabetes (T1D). The work from prior funding cycles has changed the field. The studies have
included clinical and mechanistic investigations that led to the first drug approved by the FDA for delay of T1D
(or any autoimmune disease), and the only drug approved to change the course of T1D since the discovery of
insulin, more than 100 years ago. Our studies have led to the understanding that teplizumab modifies CD8+ T
cells and induces a signal that leads to partial exhaustion, effects of drug treatment on β cells, and patient
features that can affect these responses. However, a number of new questions have emerged which are
essential to address to further advance immune therapy for T1D with teplizumab or other agents. The
phenotypes of CD8+ T cells that identify responses to the drug diminish by 18 months after drug treatment
indicating that there are other factors that account for the long term responses that are seen in some patients.
In addition, not all patients respond but the features of responders and the mechanisms that sustain the clinical
benefits are not well understood. In this continuation proposal we aim to test two hypotheses related to the
mechanisms of teplizumab in clinical responders. We will use unique clinical samples from two successful
clinical trials to address these hypotheses – from the TN10 teplizumab prevention trial (a Phase II trial testing

disease) including samples from patients who have shown clinical responses for more than 10 years from a
course of drug, and the PROTECT trial, a Phase III clinical trial of patients with new onset T1D. In the first aim
we will test the hypothesis that teplizumab induces specific changes in autoantigen reactive T cells that results
in its efficacy. We will compare the transcriptome. phenotype (with CITEseq), and epigenome (with ASAP-seq)
of auto and viral antigen specific CD8+ T cells in samples from responders and non-responders from the two
clinical trials including samples from patients whose duration of response is more than 10 years. In the second
aim, we will test the hypothesis that the host environment, which may be shaped by prior infection (with EBV),
commensals (identified by anti-commensal antibodies), age, HLA type, and other factors, determines
responses to teplizumab treatment in responders and non-responders. We will use single cell techniques to
evaluate cells from the patients in the two clinical trials. We will use this information to develop a model that
incorporates the single cell and clinical features to predict clinical responses to teplizumab. These studies will
identify immune mechanisms that can lead to operational tolerance. This information is important for
understanding the pathogenesis of human T1D. I enables us to build on the prior successes by combining
agents that can target pathways that maintain tolerance. In addition, it enables us to identify which patient are
most likely to respond and when they should be treated."

This proposal is a five-year career development plan that will support my transition to an independent career as
a neuroscientist and neuro-ophthalmologist focused on understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in
the visual system and developing therapies for vision restoration. I am currently an Instructor in the Department
of Neurology. Under the mentorship of Dr. David Gutmann, MD, PhD, and with the guidance of my scientific
advisory committee, I will receive didactic and practical training to expand my scientific and clinical expertise, as
well as improve my skills in collaboration, communication, lab management, grantsmanship, and leadership
needed for an independent scientific career. In addition, I will build upon my preliminary experiments to delineate
the mechanisms underlying estrogen-mediated (extrinsic) and cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-mediated (intrinsic)
vulnerability of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that collectively culminate in RGC death and vision loss in an
authenticated mouse model of optic pathway glioma (OPG).
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a cancer predisposition syndrome in which 15-20% of children develop an
OPG, a low-grade astrocytoma of the visual pathway. Of these affected children, 30-50% will experience vision
loss due to RGC death. Moreover, girls with NF1-OPG are 3-5 times more likely to require treatment due to
vision loss than boys, despite a relatively equal incidence of OPGs in both sexes. These findings suggest that
vision loss from NF1-OPG is controlled by mechanisms that are sexually dimorphic. Leveraging authenticated
mouse models of Nf1-OPG developed by the Gutmann laboratory, I identified estrogen-activated glial production
of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) as a possible extrinsic mechanism for RGC death due to Nf1-OPG. Building upon
previous findings demonstrating that defective cAMP production predisposes Nf1-mutant RGCs to injury, I also
identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor α (PKIα) as a potential mediator of the intrinsic RGC
vulnerability in the setting of Nf1-OPG. Based on these exciting preliminary results, I hypothesize that estrogen-
mediated glial expression of IL-1β is neurotoxic to Nf1-mutant RGCs with a pre-existing vulnerability to death
conferred by reduced cAMP-dependent survival signaling. In this proposal, I have designed experiments to (1)
define the necessity of estrogen-induced IL-1β in Nf1-OPG-mediated RGC death, (2) determine whether PKA
inhibition heightens RGC vulnerability in the setting of Nf1-OPG, and (3) execute preclinical studies to evaluate
estrogen suppression and cAMP restoration as potential neuroprotective strategies. The goals of the proposed
experiments aim to (1) expand our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying RGC death and vision
loss in Nf1-OPG, (2) identify targets for the development of vision restorative therapies for children with vision
loss due to NF1-OPG, and (3) lay the groundwork for my future studies and career development as a neuro-
ophthalmologist/neuroscientist focused on extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal injury in diseases of
the visual system."

This proposal leverages a new interdisciplinary collaboration between Drs. Guoyan Zhao and Erik Musiek to
define the transcriptional control of astrocyte identities, reactivities, and their roles in in Alzheimer disease (AD)
and Parkinson disease (PD) pathogenesis. AD and PD are heterogeneous, multifactorial disease that selectively
affects certain regions of the brain. Astrocytes are a major glial cell type in the central nervous system that play
critical roles in neural circuit function and brain homeostasis. Accumulating evidence supports astrocyte as a
major contributor of the neurodegenerative processes in AD and AD Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). In our
recently published work, we identified three evolutionarily conserved astrocyte subpopulations which had unique
marker gene expressions shared by the corresponding populations across multiple brain regions and different
disease conditions. However, astrocytes do exhibit regional differences and transcriptomic changes in disease
conditions linked to amyloid pathology, tauopathy, neuronal death, and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting
that astrocytes may contribute to regional differences in disease susceptibility. From this work, we have identified
ten candidate TFs that exhibited regional differential expression patterns in human astrocytes whose expressions
were dysregulated in disease conditions. Furthermore, these TFs are either known AD risk genes or have known
functions in regulating cell activation or inflammatory response in cell types other than astrocyte. In this proposal,
we will use our established in vitro and in vivo mouse experimental systems and the cutting-edge technologies
of spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq to systematically evaluate each candidate TF in regulating astrocyte
property and AD/PD pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will perform in vitro experimental investigation of candidate TFs
in regulating astrocyte property and neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
We will
manipulate candidate TF
expression in primary murine astrocyte-enriched cultures
properties of astrocyte with and without TF manipulation,
astrocyte cultures to sustain growth of mouse cortical
and human astrocytes cell line assess the
including morphological changes, the ability of
neurons, cytokine/chemokine expression,
and
and
phagocytosis capability. In
Aim 2 we will perform MERSCOPE spatial transcriptomic analysis to assess region-
specific expression of candidate TFs. In Aim 3 we will perform in vivo gene knock-down and overexpression
analyses to assess the function of candidate TFs in regulating astrocyte reactivity, neurodegenerative disease
pathology, and the impact on other cell types. If funded and successfully implemented this proposal will provide
validated TFs that regulate astrocyte activation and/or AD/PD pathology relevant to human disease pathogenesis.
These TFs are excellent candidate targets for the development of effective AD or PD treatment strategies."

Sleep disturbance is common in patients with cancer: 33% to 59% of patients (as opposed to 15% to 20% in
the general population) report sleep disturbance, which is also documented in objective measures.1-4 Similarly,
36% to 95% of family caregivers of adult patients with cancer have self-reported or objectively assessed sleep
disturbance.5,6 Chronic sleep disturbance is linked to various morbidities and mortality.3,7-11 Thus, sleep
disturbance in adult patients with cancer and their caregivers is a substantial health problem requiring effective
ways to improve it. Furthermore, evidence on the dyadic, cross-over effects of various cancer experiences of
patients on their family caregivers’ health outcomes, and vice versa, is also accumulating.12-16 About 70% of
adults sleep in the same bed with a significant other;17 so do adult cancer patients. Given sleep partners
influence on each other’s sleep,18-20 intervening with both sleep partners, particularly among the adult patients
with cancer and their caregivers who are at high risk for sleep disturbance, is a logical step.
Our team developed a dyadic intervention, My Sleep Our Sleep (MSOS),21 to improve sleep quality of both
adult patients with cancer and their caregivers who sleep in the same bed with the patient (hereafter sleep-
partner caregivers). MSOS was developed including behavioral and cognitive components of the cognitive
behavioral therapy tailored for insomnia (CBT-I), a gold standard for treating individuals with sleep
disorders.22,23 MSOS, in four 1-hour weekly sessions that are delivered via HIPAA-compliant Zoom, is
innovative as it accommodates the experiences of cancer and caring for a partner with cancer that are
attributable to the sleep disturbance, targets both sleep partners, and capitalizes on the significant
interpersonal nature of sleep. Our single arm pilot study provided preliminary support for the feasibility and
acceptability of MSOS. This R21 application is to expand the investigation to test preliminary efficacy of MSOS
against a brief individual-focused intervention (Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia, BBTI 24-26) and to
explore close relationship factors as the intervention’s success.
The knowledge gained from this study will be used to refine the procedures, measurement, and session contents
for a Phase III trial27,28 testing the efficacy of MSOS. Parameter estimates obtained from this R21, in addition to
results from other studies, will help facilitating the development of R01 applications testing the MSOS
intervention for diverse populations, comparing individual/actor and dyadic/partner effects between the two
intervention conditions, with longer follow-ups to determine longer-term health effects. The knowledge from this
project will also inform how to better Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage (RAISE) family
caregivers in line with the RAISE Family Caregivers Act29 as well as may have substantial implications for
traditional sleep research and telehealth practice with medical populations, shifting the emphasis from
individual- to dyad/family-based approaches."
10985665,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the world’s deadliest cancer, but patients with NSCLC can
have dramatically different outcomes, illuminating an urgent clinical unmet need for improved risk stratification.
Our study is motivated by the following unresolved questions in NSCLC oncology: 1) What is the likelihood of
recurrence for patients with definitively treated disease? 2) Which patients with advanced disease are most likely
to benefit from consolidative radiotherapy? 3) What is the likelihood that a patient will develop central nervous
system metastasis? We contend that predictive models derived from real-world data collected as part of standard
of care, including tumor genomic profiling, imaging, and clinician notes, combined with newer clinical assays
such as circulating tumor (ct)DNA sequencing and radiomics will advance personalized answers to these
questions, leading to improved outcomes for patients. We have recently developed methods to overcome
barriers to using real-world data with transformer-based natural language processing, eliminating the need for
time-intensive manual curation of clinician notes, yielding structured data critical for developing predictive
models. In a proof of principle study, we validated the prognostic value of ctDNA sequencing merged with
radiomic, tumor registry and tissue genomic data to create a richly annotated dataset an order of magnitude
larger than recent manually curated cohorts. Our preliminary studies show that multimodal models incorporating
complementary data streams improve overall survival prediction over any single data modality, such as stage or
tissue genomics, and standard of care biomarkers. Based on these results, we hypothesize that specific
combination models, encompassing real world data from ctDNA and clinicogenomic sources, more accurately
inform tumor biology and patient outcomes than single-modality variables. We will improve risk stratification and
clinical management of NSCLC by studying whether and how real-world data can be used to develop multimodal
risk models that in the future could be deployed in clinical settings with minimal patient and clinician overhead.
Candidate. Justin Jee, MD PhD is an Instructor in the Thoracic Oncology Service at MSK. His goal is to integrate
AI-extracted clinicogenomic data to discover multimodal biomarkers of antineoplastic response for patients with
cancer. He will undergo a five-year training period with a multidisciplinary mentorship team including experts in
computational oncology, machine learning, genomics, natural language processing, radiomics, and thoracic
oncology to obtain the skills necessary to become an independent, tenure-track physician scientist.

Field-Deployable, Low-Cost Point-of-Need Approaches and Technologies to Lower the Barriers to
Substance Use Disorders (SUD) Diagnosis and Treatment
Twenty years after the FDA approval of buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), its
availability remains far too restricted. This restriction is in spite of regulatory relaxations over these two
decades: from increased panel size to broadening qualifying clinicians to ultimately removing any
required waiver. It has also become clear that certain circumstances make patients especially
vulnerable to harm from OUD. These include settings where medical attention is possible but
buprenorphine is not provided (e.g, jails and prisons, emergency departments, and residential
treatment for OUD), geographic areas where people are especially isolated from treatment (e.g, rural
Tribal Nations), and life circumstances that confer additional risk (e.g., the perinatal period).
We now have new tools to deliberately reach these settings. The regulatory suspension of an in-person
visit during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed telehealth to dramatically increase its ability to care for
patients, especially those with Medicaid. This increase in telehealth care has consequently allowed for
research as to its effectiveness. Repeated studies find remote treatment with buprenorphine to be as
good—and often better—than in-person treatment as usual. Research also calls attention to gaps that
must be addressed to achieve treatment success with telehealth, including an affordable,
readily-available working phone with reliable cellular and/or network coverage.
These relatively low-cost technologies are the ones we propose to make available in the crucial settings
described previously. Provision of a smartphone and connectivity will allow people in high-risk situations
to begin treatment with Boulder Care’s proven approach and capabilities. We propose 5 partnerships
that will, in Phase I, allow us to develop and test workflows with 5 participants per site and refine them
for each setting, culminating with qualitative and quantitative research findings, including focus groups
with participants and sites. With our workflows studied and optimized, our Phase II will then enroll 50
participants in Boulder Care from these 5 sites. Our primary endpoint, as with our prior SBIR grant, is
duration of treatment with buprenorphine over a 48 week period. Secondary patient-centered outcomes
will include measures of quality of life, functional outcomes, and assessments of recovery capital.
Our partners include Sano Health, an experienced provider of technologies to vulnerable populations,
and National Survivors Union, an organization of People Who Use Drugs who are accomplished
community researchers. Together with site partners, this collaboration has proven, real-world,
community-based expertise and will provide scalable life-saving treatment at the point of need."

Carbohydrates (also known as glycans) comprise one of the largest, most diverse collections of biologically
active molecules. However, relative to other biomolecules such as nucleic acids and proteins, carbohydrates
remain poorly understood due to challenges in their detection, synthesis, and analysis. The broad objective of
this program is to develop chemical approaches to advance a fundamental understanding of the roles of
carbohydrates in biology and disease. In the last granting period, we developed a novel Networking of Interactors
and SubstratEs (NISE) method to study the biological functions of O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc)
glycosylation. O-GlcNAc is an abundant, essential post-translational modification that is emerging as a key
regulator of many physiological functions, ranging from epigenetic and transcriptional gene regulation to insulin
signaling, cancer cell metabolism, and neurodegeneration. Our NISE approach combines new chemoproteomic
tools, genetic engineering, mass spectrometry analysis, and bioinformatics methods to quantitatively profile O-
GlcNAc sites and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) interactors across the proteome and to determine key
interconnections between the interactors and substrates. The resulting networks have revealed novel,
unexpected functions for O-GlcNAc and highlighted potential mechanisms to explain the unique specificity of
OGT. In the coming granting period, we will expand on this approach and investigate the roles of O-
GlcNAcylation in neurons and in the context of neurodegenerative diseases as we continue to tackle the next
critical barriers in the field. In Aim 1, we will focus on understanding how O-GlcNAcylation within intrinsically
disordered, low-complexity domains of proteins affects their functions and alters biomolecular condensate (BMC)
formation, composition, and dynamics. These studies should provide new paradigms and methods for
understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which O-GlcNAc regulates proteins and its role in aberrant BMC
activity linked to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRDs). In Aim 2, we will test specific
hypotheses revealed by our NISE networks regarding the regulation of OGT activity at neuronal synapses and
specifically toward proteins implicated in AD/ADRDs. In Aim 3, we will apply our NISE method to examine directly
how O-GlcNAcylation of specific proteins and pathways becomes dysregulated during AD pathogenesis and with
disease-specific mutations by using patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and human AD brain
samples. Together, the proposed studies will provide a powerful approach to identify and understand
physiologically important and/or disease-causing O-GlcNAcylation events. In turn, this information is expected
to provide new potential therapeutic targets and/or strategies to combat progressive neurodegeneration and
AD/ADRDs."

The scale of opioid harms in the US and globally requires urgent action to improve efforts to reduce such harms.
Evidence on the number of people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is critical to quantify opioid agonist treatment
(OAT) coverage and the scale-up required to reduce drug related deaths in the population.
Administrative databases linked at the individual-level have great power to inform prevalence estimates, examine
rare outcomes, and explore subgroup and context specific variations of OAT. To date, there has been relatively
limited use of data linkage in US OUD and OAT research, in part reflecting challenges and concerns about ethics
and feasibility. Yet many of these challenges equally exist – and have been managed – in other countries. The
fragmented and particularly complex US healthcare system presents additional complications, but there are
examples of US jurisdictions that have managed to overcome these.
The TRANSFORM team will undertake a first of its kind multi-jurisdictional study using data linkages in the US
(Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Colorado, and Massachusetts), Australia (New South Wales), and the United
Kingdom (Scotland). The two non-US sites involve leading researchers globally who will be able to leverage the
data and methods in those jurisdictions to apply to the four US sites and develop resources that can then be
applied to other US jurisdictions.
This work will generate crucial new data on the prevalence of OUD and characterize jurisdiction-specific impacts
of OAT across settings and clinical contexts. Mathematical modeling will provide jurisdiction-specific information
about where the greatest impacts of enhanced OAT access on mortality can be achieved, to inform practice,
policy, and advocacy. Analytic code and resources for estimating prevalence, analyzing linked data, and
developing jurisdiction-specific models will be made freely available. This will increase understanding of and
capacity for these study designs to be implemented in other jurisdictions across the United States and globally.
The overall study objective is to transform the evidence base on the prevalence of OUD and the impact of OAT
as a strategy to prevent opioid harm. Specific aims include: Aim 1. Generate robust OUD prevalence estimates;
Aim 2. Examine the impact of OAT on overdose and all-cause mortality in different OAT populations, treatment
systems, and jurisdictions (these data will inform the statistical and population modelling in Aims 1 & 3,
respectively); and Aim 3. Determine the population-level impact of existing and expanded access of OAT
provision on fatal overdose and all-cause mortality among people with OUD in select jurisdictions."

Nearly 50% of all pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (FGR) go undetected until after birth,
despite improvements in obstetric imaging and management. To avoid stillbirth, if FGR is detected, many
babies are delivered preterm and may face poor outcomes associated with immature organs. Early diagnosis
of FGR and the ability to predict abnormal fetal oxygenation later in gestation would improve outcomes for
these babies not only during pregnancy and the neonatal period but also throughout life. Currently there are
no methods for early second trimester diagnosis of placental dysfunction leading to poor fetal growth early in
the second trimester. Developing safe diagnostic tests of placental and fetal function is therefore
critical to improving population health. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the
placenta and fetus to comprehensively model and measure markers of placental maturation, growth and
function in FGR. Importantly, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is safe and can image the whole fetus
and placenta throughout pregnancy, providing rich complementary information to existing ultrasound imaging
data. We hypothesise that MRI in early gestation used to measure placental function and oxygenation will
1) predict fetal growth several weeks later and 2) correlate with gene and protein expression of molecular
markers of the regulation of placental growth, transport and function in late gestation.
In SA1, we will perform predictive MRI scans at 80 and 105d gestation in sheep (term, 150d), which is
equivalent in body weight and brain maturation to a human fetus at ∼20 and 28 weeks gestation, and again
at 130d gestation (equivalent to a term human fetus). These predictive MRI scans will measure placental
diffusion, oxygen saturation in the fetal blood in the placenta, placental oxygen consumption and oxygen
delivery to the uterus and the fetus. A late gestation scan will be a validation MRI to show placental and fetal
function and growth and thus the predictive capacity of the earlier scans. We will address SA2 by measuring
the functional response of the placenta to an increase in maternal oxygenation during each MRI session.
This will allow us to determine if pregnancies complicated by FGR have a different response in placental
function from normal pregnancies. This is important as it may act as a diagnostic test in addition to normal
placental function as determined by MRI. SA3 will be addressed by collecting samples of the placenta to
measure gene and protein markers that are known to regulate growth and to be markers of maturation and/or
dysfunction on the day after the last MRI. These studies will determine if MRI can be used to measure
placental function early in the second trimester to diagnose FGR and to predict fetal growth and outcome in
the third trimester. This will allow us to determine if there is a relationship between the noninvasive MRI data
and molecular regulation of placental growth and thus identification of potential targets for intervention to
improve placental and fetal growth in the future."

Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotypic modulation, from contractile to proliferative phenotypes, is
central to the etiologies of human occlusive vascular diseases, such as restenosis and atherosclerosis.
Identification of the key players that regulate VSMC phenotypic switching is critical for further understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of VSMC-driven occlusive vascular diseases and also for developing novel
therapeutic approaches. We have previously demonstrated that HMGXB4, a novel high mobility group (HMG)
box domain containing 4, attenuates smooth muscle differentiation and aggravating endotoxin-induced systemic
inflammation in mice. Yet, the role and underlying mechanisms of HMGXB4 in occlusive vascular diseases in
vivo remain unclear. Furthermore, a recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified genetic variants
in the HMGXB4 gene locus associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), suggesting a
potential role of HMGXB4 in CAD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the functional role and
elucidate the underlying mechanism of the uncharacterized nuclear protein HMGXB4 in occlusive vascular
diseases. Novel preliminary data in this proposal include 1) HMGXB4 expression is upregulated in both human
and mouse occlusive vascular samples, and correlates with VSMC inflammation and phenotypic switching in
vivo. 2) The increased expression of HMGXB4 in occlusive vascular diseases is mainly located in VSMCs. 3)
TNFa, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, induces HMGXB4 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in
VSMCs in vitro. 4) Knockdown of HMGXB4 in VSMCs attenuates while over-expression of HMGXB4 promotes
VSMC phenotypic switching in vitro. 5) HMGXB4 interacts with p65 and enhance p65 mediated NF-kB activation.
6) Global deletion of Hmgxb4 ameliorates wire injury-induced neointima and hyperlipidemia-induced
atherosclerosis lesion formation. Three specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis that the pro-
inflammatory cytokine TNFa upregulates HMGXB4 in VSMCs to promote VSMC inflammation and proliferation,
thereby driving occlusive vascular diseases. K99 Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that specific deletion of Hmgxb4 in
VSMCs attenuates occlusive vascular diseases. K99/R00 Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that TNFa upregulates
HMGXB4 via an NF-kB/p65 dependent mechanism in VSMCs. R00 Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that
HMGXB4/NF-kB mediates expression of PIM1 to enhance VSMC inflammation and proliferation under
pathological conditions. Completion of the proposed studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms
regulating VSMC inflammation and phenotypic switching, and will determine if inhibiting HMGXB4 is an attractive
novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating occlusive vascular diseases. Additional conceptual and experimental
training in vascular inflammation-related research during the K99 phase will help the applicant pursue an
independent career and transform this proposal into an R01 application during the R00 phase."

Compulsivity, persisting with set ways of thinking and behaving in the face of negative consequences, is a
prominent component of multiple psychiatric disorders. Given the many millions of patients and family members
impacted by harms stemming from compulsive behavior, there is an urgent need to better understand the circuit
basis of this quintessentially transdiagnostic phenomenon. The objective of this K23 application is to equip the
candidate, a psychiatrist with a strong quantitative research background, to carry out intracranial studies of circuit
level computational deficits in human subjects with serious psychiatric illness. A new generation of Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices, precisely targeted and chronically
implanted, can both stimulate and record neural activity. Our preliminary data shows that this new technology
can be successfully incorporated into the treatment of patients receiving therapeutic DBS for severe obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), making it possible to directly record from clinically relevant circuitry as patients go
from sick to well. We propose to pair repeat measures of important cognitive processes (inhibitory control,
reversal learning) with serial neural recordings of key cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical (CBGTC) circuit
nodes. This experimental design will allow us to ascertain how clinical improvement is accompanied by changes
in cognitive processes, and to uncover the relevant circuit activity. In Aim 1, to identify the cognitive changes
caused by therapeutic brain stimulation we will repeatedly administer validated assays of flexibility (a reversal
learning task) and inhibition (a stop signal task). At each time point we will computationally model relevant
cognitive parameters, so that we can track evolution of decision-making dynamics as treatment progresses. In
Aim 2, we will identify neural underpinnings of the cognitive processes changed by therapeutic brain stimulation.
We have implemented an experimental paradigm that allows for millisecond-precision alignment of behavior data
and neural activity. Each time the participants perform a task, local field potentials (LFPs) will be recorded from
key CBGTC circuit nodes, never previously accessible for study in patients with compulsive disorders. With the
unique opportunity to longitudinally record directly from the basal ganglia in these patients, we will be able to
establish if these circuits do indeed subserve clinically relevant decision-making processes. This K23 proposal
is supported by a carefully assembled, collaborative, and diverse mentorship team with the requisite expertise
in psychiatric DBS, disorders of compulsivity, computational modeling of behavior, and human intracranial
recordings. The candidate will emerge from the mentored research experience equipped to lead independent
studies of deep brain circuit function in real world patients."
10992001,"Ligand activation of Eph receptors plays a decisive role in cell migration during blood vessel formation and
neuronal axon guidance. Eph receptors can also signal independently of ligands, whereby the migration- and
adhesion-repulsive signaling shifts to a pro-migratory stimulus that contributes to metastasis and drug
resistance in various cancers. Recent studies have substantiated the role of Eph receptors in the dysfunction
of the blood brain barrier (BBB) during ischemic stroke, invasion of pathogenic organisms and the early stages
of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the molecular mechanisms behind
Eph receptor function remain poorly understood. Eph signaling depends on a variety of inter-molecular and
intra-molecular Eph-Eph interactions which involve portions of the protein structure (domains) but also the
cellular membrane. The overall project seeks to identify key residues in sets of interactions, which are not yet
well characterized, but are likely to be key to the different functional states of the overall protein interactions.
Ephs are unique within the superfamily of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases due to their C-terminal 5-
helix folded domain, part of the SAM (sterile alpha motif) adaptor protein family. We and others’ have reported
a novel role of the SAM domain to auto-inhibit EphA2 kinase activity. In preliminary experiments for this
proposal, we discovered that mutations in the SAM domain functionally mimic its complete deletion and can
abolish EphA2 autoinhibition. However, the molecular details of how the SAM domain inhibits the kinase
domain are still missing and will be investigated in Aim 1. EphA2 is cleaved at the cell surface by Membrane-
type I matrix metalloproteinase and γ-secretase, key proteins for AD. However, the structure and function of
these intracellular and extracellular-transmembrane receptor cleavage products are poorly understood. We will
characterize a protein construct encompassing the intracellular region (ICR), which consists of the JM region,
the Kinase Domain (KD) and the SAM domain and another with the two membrane- proximal extracellular
FibroNectin III domains (FN1&2), the transmembrane (TM), the juxtamembrane (JM) region. In aim 2, we will
use these EphA2 fragments to investigate the interaction between Eph domains and with the membrane. This
knowledge is crucial for understanding the hierarchical organization of these regulatory interactions. The
studies will be extended to the EphA1, EphA4 and EphB2 receptors, delineating how specific differences in
domain-domain contacts relate to different levels of kinase activity between the different Ephs. In addition, the
proximity of the Eph receptor Fibronectin domains to the membrane is noteworthy: Our preliminary data for
Aim 3 support the interaction between these domains and Aβ, a key peptide in AD. The structural insights we
pursue are essential for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents targeting neuronal and vascular
diseases, including the breakdown of the blood brain barrier in neurodegenerative diseases."

The candidate Caitlyn Castellion is a first-year student who is just beginning her research career. Ms. Castellion
wants to earn a PhD, become a tenure-track faculty member at a research institution, and remedy the lack of
representation of Hispanic women in biochemistry. The diversity supplement will provide her with a solid foun-
dation to chase these career goals. The goal is to equip Ms. Castellion with technical skills, oral, and written
presentation skills through mentoring experiences tailored around her life experiences, unique strengths as a
scientist and career goals. The research plan detailed earlier intentionally exposes Ms. Castellion to both the
synthetic chemistry, lithography, as well as cell/molecular biology aspects of the proposal, which will hopefully
help her refine her research interests by balancing depth and breadth of research experiences. The PI will work
closely with Ms. Castellion at the bench so that she develops expertise in polymer brush synthesis, surface
characterization, mammalian cell culture, cellular assays for polymer-mediated pDNA delivery, and proteomics.
Ms. Castellion will be encouraged to present every month at the lab group meeting, in addition to weekly meet-
ings with the PI and coI to identify roadblocks and workarounds. In addition to the PI, Ms. Castellion will be
informally advised and supported by NSF GRF Jesssica Lawson and a postdoctoral scholar Dr. Ram Prasad
Sekar. Faculty members (Dr. Krishna and Dr. Moyers) will act as academic mentors who will join the PI in advising
Ms. Castellion on non-technical aspects of her career development plan.
The candidate will work on a research direction that is both complementary to and distinct from the original
research plan. This will allow her to benefit from the expertise of the Kumar lab while still forging her own inde-
pendent path. Importantly, the data that she will generate will either generate publications that are independent
of publications resulting from the original research plan. Specifically, she will investigate the role of nanocluster-
ing GAG-mimetic ligands by varying the spatial distribution of polymer brushes. Spatial distribution of polymer
brushes was not proposed in the original research plan due to time and budget constraints. The candidate will
test the following hypothesis: the distances between GAG-mimetic ligands (unsulfated or sulfated glycan resi-
dues) will dictate the proximity of receptor clusters on hMSCs and consequently promote hMSC self-renewal.
We predict that hMSC self-renewal will exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on ligand spacing, with neither
large nor small ligand spacings promoting hMSC proliferation. Rather, ligand spacings that match the inter-re-
ceptor distances on hMSCs will perform best as cell culture substrates, providing an additional level of control
(apart from polymer brush composition and thickness) to augment hMSC self-renewal. After characterizing the
effects of ligand spacing on hMSC self-renewal, the candidate will prime hMSCs on nanopatterned GAG-mimetic
brushes that promoted receptor clustering and self-renewal and test whether polycation-mediated pDNA delivery
is more efficient when hMSCS are primed on nanopatterned substrates with optimized ligand spacings."

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a family of bacterial protein toxins. They are one of the six
most dangerous potential bioterrorism agents. Members of BoNTs, BoNT/A (Botox) and BoNT/B,
are also FDA-approved for treating a growing list of disorders, as well as for reducing wrinkles.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms for this family of toxins, engineering toxins to improve
their therapeutic uses, and developing effective countermeasures have been the focus of our lab.
Our prior funding cycle has led to major discoveries in understanding toxin receptors, identification
of novel BoNT-like toxins, and development of new treatment that can neutralize BoNTs inside
motor neurons. In this renewal proposal, we will address both side of BoNTs through protein
engineering approaches: Aim 1 seeks to develop a novel chimeric toxin that can preferentially
bind to the toxin receptor isoform dominantly expressed in autonomic and sensory neurons and
evaluate its improvement over the standard Botox for treating overactive bladder conditions in
rodent models. Aim 2 seeks to develop and evaluate novel nanobody-based triple-epitopic
antibodies (NTAb) for neutralizing and clearing BoNTs in the circulatory system. NTAb is
constructed by fusion of three nanobodies targeting distinct regions on BoNTs and then to a Fc,
thus generating an artificial antibody that can achieve binding of three NTAb to a single toxin
molecule, which promotes toxin clearance. In this proposal, we will develop two sets of NTAb,
targeting two most common toxins, BoNT/A and BoNT/B, respectively, and thoroughly evaluate
their efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxin clearance using rodent and guinea pig models."

In the last 30 years there has been a dramatic increase in our understanding of the genetic and non-genetic
mechanisms that contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy in humans. Despite this increased
mechanistic understanding, the risk of heart failure and sudden death remains high in this patient population.
While multiple small molecule agents reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients with cardiomyopathy, many
patients still progress to end stage disease. In addition, these small molecule agents act in a non-cell type
specific manner and their utilization is often limited by side effects. Likewise, pharmacological therapy to
prevent sudden death in individuals with cardiomyopathy remains lacking, and many patients still require an
implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Therefore, new strategies are required to reduce disease progression
and sudden death in patients with cardiomyopathy. Preventing the degradation of circulating natriuretic
peptides by the chemical inhibition of neprilysin has proven to be very beneficial in patients with dilated
cardiomyopathy. The combination of the neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker,
valsartan, not only reduced mortality secondary to heart failure but also significantly reduced sudden death in
the dilated cardiomyopathy population. However, in the landmark clinical trial PARADIGM-HF, many trial
participants developed symptomatic hypotension (14%), renal failure (3.3%), or hyperkalemia (16.1%) from
sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696). In an effort to understand why alterations in NP signaling impact cardiomyopathy
remodeling and sudden death, we studied murine models deficient in either atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) or
B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). We found that reduced levels of either ANP or BNP led to increased stress
induced sudden death and ventricular arrhythmias. Mechanistically, we discovered that the phosphorylation of
the transcription factor CREB1 was regulated by NP signaling, and a reduction in CREB1 signaling sensitized
the heart to stress induced ventricular arrhythmias. We have now discovered that NP-PKG1 signaling can
activate protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1 (PIAS1), which regulates the levels of the key cardiomyocyte
calcium regulatory protein SERCA2a. We hypothesize that cardiomyocyte selective targeting of key natriuretic
peptide regulated pathways will improve myocardial function and reduce ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility in
cardiomyopathy while avoiding systemic side effects. Aim 1: Define how cardiomyocyte specific modulation of
PKG1 activity modifies cardiomyopathy progression and arrhythmia susceptibility. Aim 2: Determine the role of
PIAS1 in regulating cardiomyopathy progression and ventricular arrhythmias. Aim 3: Define how CREB1
signaling modifies cardiomyopathy remodeling and ventricular arrhythmias. At the conclusion of these high
impact studies, we will have defined how cardiomyocyte selective modulation of natriuretic peptide signaling
pathways modifies cardiac remodeling and arrhythmogenesis in preclinical cardiomyopathy models, setting the
stage for future therapeutic strategies in humans."

This application is developed to support Rozalyn Rodwin, MD, MHS, a current Assistant Professor in Pediatric
Hematology-Oncology at Yale School of Medicine, in transitioning to independence as a physician-scientist
who investigates the late effects of childhood cancer therapy. Her long-term career goal is to improve the
health and quality of life of childhood cancer survivors by developing and implementing new methods to screen
for treatment-related acute and long-term toxicities of cancer-directed therapy. Dr. Rodwin’s project will build
on her prior work that used quantitative methods to identify symptoms of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy (CIPN) in children with cancer and measure the associated impact. With the mentorship and
support of a multidisciplinary team of experts in pediatric oncology health outcomes, childhood cancer
survivorship, treatment toxicity, qualitative research, survey development, physical therapy, and
implementation science, Dr. Rodwin will 1) acquire advanced training in qualitative research, 2) learn
techniques necessary to develop and validate surveys, and 3) train in implementation science, through a
combination of didactic and experiential training activities and mentored research. CIPN is a debilitating side
effect that occurs in up to 87% of children during cancer treatment. It particularly impacts young children by
interfering with key motor developmental milestones and can have a lifelong impact on their health. Early
detection and intervention can improve symptoms, but up to 80% of cases are missed. CIPN is challenging to
diagnose because there are no validated screening measures for children younger than five, even though
~40% of children at risk for CIPN are under five. Proxy-report surveys completed by a parent or guardian have
been used to screen for other health conditions in young children but have not been developed for CIPN. This
project's overarching goal is to improve CIPN screening in young children ages 1-5 years by developing a
novel proxy-report instrument that a parent or guardian can complete. We aim to 1) develop items for a novel
proxy-report symptom-based survey to screen for CIPN using qualitative methods, 2) prospectively evaluate
the survey’s psychometric properties, and 3) collect preliminary data to inform survey implementation. This
instrument will enable the identification of patients with CIPN who can benefit from interventions to promote
childhood cancer survivors’ long-term health. Along with the proposed coursework, this research will provide
Dr. Rodwin with the training and experience to independently conduct future studies aimed at further validation
and implementation of this instrument. She will apply the knowledge gained through this project to other
studies aimed at screening and early intervention for treatment-related toxicities in childhood cancer survivors."
10981756,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with cancer in low-resource settings face a survival rate of only 20%. Clinical
deterioration, defined as the worsening of patient status that requires clinical teams to recognize
and respond in a coordinated fashion, remain a major cause of childhood cancer mortality
globally. Interdisciplinary communication is essential to high-quality cancer care, especially
during high-acuity events such as clinical deterioration. Despite knowledge that high quality
interdisciplinary communication improves patient care and outcomes, we lack an understanding
of specific modifiable determinants of communication quality and appropriate, usable, and
measurable communication interventions. This is particularly true in low-resource settings. We
have previously developed a valid, reliable, multilingual measure of communication quality
during clinical deterioration and have conceptualized that communication structure and quality
interact to directly impact the quality of childhood cancer care. The goal of this proposal is to
develop and test a bundled multilevel intervention that responds to modifiable determinants of
interdisciplinary communication quality and structural communication patterns in low-resource
pediatric oncology hospitals to improve communication and care delivery. To accomplish this
goal, we will engage clinicians and hospitals in low-resource settings. In Aim 1 we will identify
the relationship between communication structure and quality in the care of children with
cancer. We will conduct a cross-sectional social network analysis from 10 high-quality
communication and 10 low-quality communication hospitals as determined by previous work. In Aim
2, we will develop a multilevel intervention to improve communication quality in low-resource
hospitals. We will conduct a sequential mixed methods study using quantitative data from Aim 1
supplemented by qualitative interviews with clinicians. Following this, we will engage a global panel
of experts in communication and clinical care to conduct implementation mapping, which will develop
and prioritize an intervention to address common communication challenges. In Aim 3 we will
conduct a cluster randomized control trial to test the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of
this multilevel intervention to improve communication quality in low-resource hospitals. We will
test the identified intervention bundle at 8 low-resource hospitals. Our primary outcome will be the
change in communication quality score, and we will also assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
appropriateness of the intervention among frontline clinicians. When complete, this work will
improve interdisciplinary communication and clinical outcomes for children with cancer in
hospitals of all resource levels, thus advancing health equity globally."
10980625,"Botulinum Neurotoxins (BoNTs) are a large family of protein toxins that possess extreme potency and cause
severe disease in humans and animals. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease of long duration, lasting up to
several months. Without proper medical care, naturally occurring botulism is lethal in up to 50% of cases, and
even with supportive care and antitoxin administration, botulism is a devastating and severe disease and
remains lethal in ~ 5 % of cases. While naturally occurring botulism is rare, BoNTs are classified as a Tier 1
Category A Select Agents due to their threat as potential bioterrorist weapons and severity and long duration of
the disease. Conversely, BoNTs are widely used human biotherapies to treat more than 200 neuromuscular
disorders, some of which are devastating without this unique treatment. BoNTs are divided immunologically
into seven BoNT serotypes (A-G), which are further subdivided into subtypes. For example, there are eight
subtypes of BoNT/A. Hundreds of BoNT and BoNT-like variants have been identified by sequencing efforts, but
only few variants have been investigated for potency and duration of action at the protein level. Note, only two
subtypes, BoNT/A1 and BoNT/B1 are currently used as therapeutics. Our recent studies have used BoNT/A
subtypes to determine, for the first time, the basis for long duration of action, stable association of LC/A1 on
the intracellular plasma membrane, and mechanisms for the high BoNT/A1 potency. This renewal will
determine detailed molecular mechanism for the specific durations of action of BoNT serotypes that elicit
natural human botulism and LC targeting of SNAP-25 on the plasma membrane. A novel mRNA-based BoNT
Light Chain expression system will be used to standardize the determination of BoNT duration of action and
potency. Translational studies will develop long duration variants of other BoNT serotypes as alternates for
BoNT/A1 as a therapeutic agent to overcome BoNT/A specific treatment resistance. The collaborative efforts of
the Pellett and Barbieri laboratories combine computational, molecular, and cellular approaches with BoNT
studies by mouse bioassays and in human and rodent cell-based assays, including human motor-neurons.
These studies will use native BoNTs, recombinant BoNTs produced in native expression hosts, and individual
subunits to assess the two most important aspects of BoNTs, duration of action and potency. A streamlined
approach will first investigate subunit domains in functional studies and select specific alterations for the more
effort- and cost-intensive construction and analyses of holotoxins. Completion of these studies will provide a
detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying BoNT potency, where in addition to cell entry and
catalysis, intracellular LC trafficking and membrane association are contributing factors. The molecular
concepts identified in these studies can be extrapolated to other protein toxins."

This is an R01 application to prospectively evaluate an asynchronously-delivered intervention (“Unburdened”)
that targets reactivity to difficult client interactions, adapted for students and embedded into veterinary
technician (RVT) and medicine (DVM) training programs. The field of veterinary medicine is experiencing a
mental health crisis; evidence-based approaches to reduce occupational distress are critically needed. One
key mechanism for occupational distress in this field is “burden transfer,” or reactivity to challenging
interactions with veterinary clients. Our team developed an Acceptance and Commitment Training (ACT)
intervention specifically targeting burden transfer; randomized trials show it reduces stress and burnout for
veterinary workers across live and asynchronous delivery methods. Our data also show benefits of this
intervention up to 1 year later, as well as high rates of acceptability in RVT and DVM students. We will adapt
the Unburdened intervention for student use in an easily-shared format and embed it into RVT and DVM
training. Participants will be 200 advanced students (100 RVT, 100 DVM) from 5 programs agreeing to embed
the intervention into final semester coursework on an alternating basis, creating Intervention and Control
groups. Online assessments will be done at baseline, upon completion (1 month), and follow-up (3, 6, 9, 12
months). Outcomes will include student engagement and perception of the program, performance on a
knowledge test, frequency of skills used, and responses on validated measures of burden transfer, stress,
burnout, anxiety, and depression. In keeping with Research to Practice (r2P) goals, if successful, our team will
work with the American Veterinary Medical Association Director of Wellbeing Initiatives to disseminate this
ready-to-share intervention to RVT and DVM programs nationwide. Outputs of this work will include the
Unburdened intervention itself (adapted for student use, integrated into a shareable program that is accessed
at the click of a link); the also team plans for publication in high-tier journals (e.g., Journal of the American
Veterinary Medical Association), conference presentations and proceedings, and social media dissemination. If
successful, expected intermediate outcomes of this work include routine adoption of this training in RVT and
DVM curricula nationwide. Expected end outcomes include a culture shift in the field, with potential for
decreased burden transfer, stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression among veterinary healthcare workers.
Ultimately, the proposed work could provide a scalable and sustainable strategy that leads to greater mental
health and well-being across the veterinary workforce. This proposal aligns with NIOSH strategic goal 7.2 by
testing an intervention targeting well-being in veterinary healthcare workers, providing skills to cope with
difficult client interactions. We will adapt and evaluate a school-based intervention, addressing NORA HWD
Cross Sector Objectives 1 & 4 through inclusion of a high-risk demographic (young workers) and aiming to
reduce mental health burdens (depression and anxiety)."
10981489,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Thalamic circuits are dominated by two sources of inhibition that have a profound influence on the type and
quantity of information that relay cells transmit from eye to brain: These are local interneurons within the dorsal
lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (dLGN), and the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)—
a thin sheet of GABAergic cells that lies nearby. Local interneurons receive retinal input and synapse with relay
cells and each other to supply powerful feedforward inhibition. By contrast, relay cells make only sparse
connections within the main layers of dLGN. Rather, they contact neurons in TRN, whose dense axonal arbors
provide feedback inhibition in return. In addition to receiving ascending information, these three types of cells
(local interneurons, relay cells, reticular cells) in the dLGN/TRN complex are embedded in a larger network that
involves top-down input from cortex; this arrangement is repeated across primary thalamic nuclei in mammals.
Thus, learning how thalamic circuits operate is key to understanding sensory integration and, moreover, serves
studies of disorders such as amblyopia or the development of visual prosthetics by providing a blueprint for how
healthy brains function. Here we focus on TRN in mouse, a species that has become central to studies of vision
because of the many experimental advantages it offers, but whose visual system differs somewhat from those
of traditional experimental subjects like carnivore and primate. The design of the project is inspired by a
framework voiced by Francis Crick, who theorized that TRN might act as a searchlight that increases thalamic
activity in specific regions of interest, or as a thermostat that regulates levels of global activity. We evaluate
predictions of each hypothesis to explore visual processing per se, by combining comparative, optogenetic,
physiological, anatomical, and computational approaches. The project comprises three interrelated aims, as
follows. The searchlight hypothesis suggests that receptive fields in TRN are feature specific and localized and
we have shown that this is the case in carnivore; Aim 1 uses physiological and computational approaches to
analyze the spatiotemporal features encoded in mouse visual TRN across visual space. These results are then
incorporated into a model framework that ties the output of inhibitory cells, including TRN and local interneurons
(we have studied these previously) to patterns of inhibition recorded from the relay cell’s receptive field. Aim 2
explores the link between receptive field structures in dLGN and TRN mechanistically by exploring how input
from dLGN influences visual response properties in TRN and vice versa; opsins that suppress synaptic
transmission and statistical tools that reveal connectivity between neurons are used to approach this topic.
Finally, Aim 3 takes the general perspective of the thermostat hypothesis and asks how responses of TRN to
global stimulus properties might regulate, at one extreme, inhibitory tone in dLGN, and, at the other, the fine
temporal structure of the relay cell’s response. Taken together, our results will provide critical insight into
thalamic contributions to visual processing that are conserved across species."
10984444,"Project Description: Thyroid cancer incidence is rapidly increasing in the United States. Veterans are at even
higher risk of developing thyroid cancer in their lifetime due to the increased potential of radiation exposure in
the armed services. Furthermore, veterans who suffered from thyroid cancer self-reported a higher prevalence
of Agent Orange exposure, increasing the relevance of this malignancy to the VA population. Despite the use of
a range of combinations of treatments, ATC exhibits a dismal prognosis with a median survival of < six months.
ATC tumors possess a greater mutation burden than all other forms of thyroid cancer which impart significant
growth benefit and high metastatic potential Therefore, it is important to identify proteins that function at “nodal
points” of different signaling pathways implicated in ATC, and thus could represent ATC “Achilles Heel.” The
CTNNB1 (β-catenin) is an effector molecule of Wnt signaling which is critical for epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) required for metastasis. PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling is hyperactive in ATC due to mutations. This
can enhance β-catenin activity and also phosphorylate Map kinase Activating Death Domain-containing protein
(MADD) and contribute to its pro-survival function. pMADD renders ATC cells resistant to apoptosis. Thus in
ATC, pMADD and β-catenin can serve as two potential “nodal points.”
 Most importantly, our recent novel findings have shown that MADD knockdown can significantly inhibit
TNFα mediated activation of β-catenin signaling by preventing pERK activation and consequent pGSK3β
activation. Lack of GSK3β phosphorylation by ERK, facilitated ubiquitination of β-catenin leading to its
degradation and resultant blockage of EMT activation. Furthermore, intra-tumoral administration of MADD siRNA
significantly reduced orthotpic ATC tumor growth and lung metastasis in treated mice. Therefore, MADD is a
potential therapeutic target in ATC either alone or in combination with Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors.
 Based on a very strong scientific premise, we hypothesize that MADD down modulation can be effective
in inhibiting growth and overcoming resistance to drugs targeting hyperactive MAPK, PI3K/Akt and Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, which are hallmarks of ATC. To address this, in aim-1, we will functionally characterize the impact of
CRISPR/CAS9 mediated MADD gene knock-out in ATC cells on Wnt signaling in vitro and ex vivo; in aim-2, we
will determine the impact of down-modulating MADD expression, and MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways,
on Wnt signaling; and in aim-3, we will test the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment with MADD
knockdown in orthotopic and spontaneous mouse models of ATC.
 ATC disproportionately accounts for the majority of thyroid cancer-related deaths. Cancer cell-specific
expression of MADD, its role in activating several key signaling pathways, and its ability to act as a pro-survival
factor and promote metastasis in ATC makes it an ideal target for therapeutic development. Importantly, MADD
deletion had no apparent effect on normal cells. Thus the proposed novel studies are highly relevant to veterans."
10993907,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In response to PA-20-272, this supplement study proposes to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a
linguistically adapted mobile health (mHealth) intervention (RAISE) for Spanish speaking caregivers of legally
involved youth. The proposed research supports Goals 2 and 5 of the 2022-2066 NIDA Strategic Plan by
bolstering family support for adolescents using substances and translating research on mindfulness-based stress
reduction into an innovative mHealth application. Latinx youth are overrepresented in the juvenile legal system,
making up 22% of youth in residential facilities (including residential treatment centers, detention centers, training
schools, and juvenile jails and prisons).1 Although inequities in Latinx youth incarceration have improved over
the past decade, they remain 28% more likely to be detained or committed in juvenile facilities compared to their
white peers.2 Monolingual Spanish speaking caregivers face additional challenges navigating the juvenile legal
system due to the lack of linguistically accessible resources in the community and within the juvenile court
system. The RAISE app, which was developed under the Parent K23, is a parenting stress reduction intervention
mHealth app that was co-designed with English speaking caregivers of legally involved youth using participatory
informatics. RAISE is currently only available in English, however the co-design team included 1 bilingual
(English, Spanish) Latinx caregiver and the app was tested by 6 additional users in an open trial, 25% of whom
identified as Latinx. The inaccessibility of RAISE in languages other than English has been raised as a concern
by our collaborating systems partners due to the high number of monolingual Spanish speaking caregivers in
Northern California, where the work is primarily being conducted. Additionally, the Institutional Review Board at
the University of California, San Francisco where the PI is located commented that there is not a clear scientific
rationale for exclusion of caregivers based on English language proficiency, particularly given ethnoracial
inequities in representation in the legal system. Latinx individuals in the U.S. are interested in using mHealth
interventions3 and Latinx smartphone users are more likely than whites to use a health app4, however most
studies of mHealth interventions do not include or have low rates of Latinx participation. The current supplement
would allow for content translation to make the RAISE app available to Spanish speaking caregivers who could
benefit and provide crucial information about the equitable and ethical use of digital health interventions with
Spanish speaking caregivers of legally involved youth. The proposed research will also expand Dr. Folk's work
on improving behavioral health outcomes for marginalized youth and their families by advancing the linguistic
and cultural accessibility of her work. Findings will be used as the foundation for a larger R01 hybrid design
clinical trial testing the efficacy of RAISE in both English and Spanish, propelling a federally funded program of
research designed to increase substance use treatment engagement and improve behavioral health outcomes
for legally involved youth and families."
10993915,"Parent Grant Summary and Specific Aims
 In 2020 there will be ~ 276,480 estimated new cases of invasive breast cancer (BCa) among women in the US, causing
an estimated ~ 42,170 deaths. Two common mechanisms for the sustenance of BCa are epigenetic dysfunction and the
malfunction of endocrine proteins such as estrogen receptor (ER). The specific focus of the studies proposed in this
application is to repurpose deferiprone (Def), an FDA-approved iron chelator, as a template for the discovery of novel
histone lysine demethylase (KDM) inhibitors optimized for BCa therapy. Most compounds that have been or are being
developed clinically exhibit greater efficacy for a subtype of BCa. In this regard, therapeutic interventions that capitalize
on ER signaling malfunctions, a driver of more than 70% of BCas, have enjoyed measured success in BCa therapy and/or
chemoprevention. However, despite initial benefits, most patients eventually relapse due to acquired resistance to
these drugs. Additionally, there are no targeted treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a BCa
subtype lacking ER, Human Epidermal Growth Factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Progesterone Receptor (PR) which accounts
for over 20% of BCa incidence. Therefore, there is an unmet medical need for increasingly selective and potent drugs to
treat early and resistant stages of all BCa subtypes.
 BCa viability, regardless of ER expression status, depends on an extensive network of epigenetic modifiers - histone
mark writers, readers and erasers. Bioinformatic and functional analysis have identified specific subfamilies of the amino
oxidase and Jumonji family of histone lysine demethylases (KDMs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and histone
deacetylase (HDACs) as essential in supporting ERα signaling activation. Among these epigenetic modifiers, KDM1,
KDM3A, KDM5A, KDM5B and KDM6A are exquisitely wired into ERα signaling and are collectively vital for BCa cell
viability. Moreover, studies have implicated KDMs such as KDM6A in other ER-independent epigenetic reprograming
which sustains TNBC as well. Unlike ERα signaling, pharmacological inhibition of KDMs has not been clinically validated.
Although inhibition of KDM3A, KDM5A, KDM5B and KDM6A caused BCa cells growth arrest in vitro and in vivo, there are
however precedents for compensation among KDM paralogs in tumor models generated by selective deletion of a
paralog member. We hypothesize that collective inhibition of KDM paralogs implicated in BCa etiology will blunt the
possibility of compensation among KDM paralogs that could occur from paralog selective inhibition, resulting in novel
selective and potent drugs to treat BCa regardless of the cell ER expression status. The proposed study is designed to test
this hypothesis. The specific aims are: 1) Develop Def-based KDM inhibitors with favorable toxicological and
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. 2) Characterize the correlation between intracellular on-target effects and whole cell
antiproliferative activity. 3) Investigate the in vivo efficacy of lead compounds in five BCa murine models."
10993919,"ABSTRACT
Tumor suppressor p53 is the quintessential guardian of the genome whose function is inhibited in greater than
50% of all human cancers. Though mutation and deletion of p53 are major contributors to p53 inactivation,
overexpression of the negative regulators MDM2 and MDM4 (MDMX) are also known to inactivate p53, thus
leading to the cancer phenotype. Our lab has shown that specific types of cell stress initiate the generation of
an alternatively spliced isoform of MDM2. The predominant MDM2 alternative isoform, MDM2-ALT1 also
known as MDM2-B, functions to primarily activate the p53 pathway by inhibiting MDM2 and MDM4 in a
dominant negative fashion. Paradoxically, this isoform is upregulated in several human cancers, such as
pediatric high-grade gliomas, astrocytomas, rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS), and liposarcomas, as well as adult
cancers such as lymphomas and those of the breast. Thus, MDM2-ALT1 plays opposing roles in cancer
progression dependent upon the context of its expression. In the proposed research, we will study the
underpinnings of the control of the p53 pathway by MDM2-ALT1 to better understand 1) the specific
mechanism by which that MDM2-ALT1 is generated in cancer and 2) the ability of the resultant isoforms to be
targeted using splice-switching oligonucleotides. We hypothesize that the expression of oncogenic MDM2-
ALT1 is modulated by alterations in protein and RNA nuclear factors during the progression to tumorigenesis
and can be targeted to induce splicing changes. We will use assays that identify and measure splice regulation
in conjunction with gene editing approaches to identify RNA sequences and their respective nuclear factor-
binding partners necessary for regulation of MDM2 splicing. Furthermore, we will use novel genetically
engineered mouse models as well as established mouse xenograft assays and novel splice switching
oligonucleotides (SSOs) to modulate MDM2 isoform levels. Our work will broaden our knowledge of
combinatorial regulation of RNA processing in response to stress and in cancer and interrogate the utility of
MDM2 isoforms modulation for rational control of the p53 pathway."

With an increasing proportion of the population at older ages (i.e., the ‘graying of America’), there is a growing
prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs). By the year 2030, the number of “oldest”
Americans is expected to grow by 81% among non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs), 131% among African Americans,
328% among Hispanics and 285% among Asians/Pacific Islanders. Similarly, the direct and indirect cost of
AD/ADRD is estimated to be over $450 billion by the year 2030. The mortality related to dementias have also
increased by 71% from the year 2000 to 2013. Although the incidence and prevalence of dementia is expected
to increase significantly across all racial and ethnic groups. There is existing racial/ethnic disparity in the
incidence and prevalence of ADRDs. In general, the prevalence of all dementias is 2.5-fold higher among African
Americans compared to (NHWs), with recent prospective studies, showing that African Americans have a
significantly higher incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment even after adjusting for all relevant risk
factors. While the exact reasons for the existing racial disparity in AD/ADRD is not clearly known, one potential
reason, which is the focus of this proposal, is the sickle cell mutation (HbS), which is prevalent in individuals of
African ancestry but almost entirely absent among (NHWs). Our reasoning is based on two points (1) adjustment
for traditional dementia risk factors did not attenuate the observed disparity, and (2) despite the higher increase
in the proportion of “oldest” Americans among Asians/Pacific Islanders compared to NHWs (265% vs. 81%), the
incidence of dementia in both racial/ethnic groups is on par with each other, thus a higher proportion of oldest
individual is not likely the reason for the disparity. Given the high prevalence of the APOE ε4 risk allele (~37%)
among individuals of AAs and the fact that co-inheritance of any combination of the APOE ε4 risk allele (i.e. 2/4,
3/4 or 4/4) along with SCT is a common occurrence, as shown by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the
combined presence of SCT and APOE ε4 ADRD risk allele, will lead to earlier onset and/or more severe cognitive
deficit, with accompanying increase in neuroinflammation and abnormal brain lipidomics profile compared to
controls. The findings from this proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms by which SCT modifies the
impact of APOE ε4 on ADRD risk, and thus contributes to differences in cognitive deficit and dementia observed
in our prior study among African Americans. This could allow us to address racial disparity in cognitive deficit.
Further, results from this study could provide a model system for the testing of therapies aimed specifically at
reducing racial/ethnic disparity in dementia therapy in people of African descent."

 Preconception micronutrient status (including anemia) is a critical determinant of maternal, newborn, and
child health that remains undervalued in Nepal. However, providing micronutrient supplements (MMS) alone is
not enough. In the Nepali context, the gap between marriage and the first birth is short and newly married
women have the lowest household status. Addressing the intersectional barriers to health for newly married
women, including inequitable gender norms and women’s empowerment, household relationships, nutrition
knowledge and practices—is essential for improving maternal and infant outcomes in Nepal. To mitigate the
community, household, and individual factors resulting in poor nutrition, our team developed and pilot-tested an
educational group intervention (Sumadhur, meaning “Best Relationship”) for newly married women, husbands,
and mothers-in-law triads. Sumadhur aims to provide information on nutrition and women’s health, address
inequitable gender norms and practices, strengthen household relationships and communication, and improve
the household status of newly married women. The pilot study of Sumadhur brought triads of several
households together for 16 interrelated sessions over four-months. Findings suggest that participants (N=90)
found the intervention to be highly feasible and acceptable and nutritional norms and practices improved.
 We propose to test the effectiveness of Sumadhur on maternal health and nutrition outcomes using a 2-arm
cluster RCT (cRCT). The intervention participants will receive the Sumadhur group intervention and will be
provided MMS directly at group sessions. In control villages who do not receive the Sumadhur group intervention,
we will facilitate access to MMS at primary health centers. We will randomize 70 villages to each arm (with one
group per village). Each village has one group of five women (total of 700 women). Newly married women, their
husbands and mothers-in-laws (total=2,100), will be followed four times for 18 months post-intervention through
surveys, hemoglobin tests and blood draws (women only). Our specific aims are to estimate the effectiveness of
Sumadhur on women’s anemia and micronutrient status, including the cost-benefit of the intervention (Aim 1);
explore the impact on intermediate outcomes such as gender norms, household relationships and eating
practices and characterize the individual and household-level mechanisms of impact (Aim 2); understand triadic
experiences and impact over time of Sumadhur (Aim 3).
 Accomplishing these aims will provide evidence for how to improve micronutrient and anemia status among
women before they become pregnant—thereby ensuring that women are not deficient in the critical early
phases of pregnancy. These findings will also advance the field by testing novel approaches (household and
community level behavior and norm change intervention) that, when combined with supplements, may lead to
better adherence, uptake, and, ultimately, health outcomes, and have additional longer-term benefits."

The robust, yet sensitive, systems underlying daily behaviors provide an outstanding opportunity
to apply dynamical network science to understand how neural connectivity adapts to a changing
environment. Daily rhythms in behavior and physiology (e.g., sleep-wake and hormone
secretion) depend on circadian clock genes, pacemaking cells and cell-cell signaling to adjust to
daily cues such as seasonal changes in daylength. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN,
coordinates these daily rhythms to anticipate challenges such as finding food and mates and
avoiding predators. This application focuses on major gaps in our understanding of how SCN
cells adapt and synchronize to produce daily rhythms in response to seasonal changes in
photoperiod.
The proposed experiments combine in vivo and in vitro cell-type specific perturbations and
recordings with computational biology and control engineering to test the central hypothesis that
specific and reversible changes in network topology underlie adaptation to long and short days.
The Aims will map, for the first time, cell-cell connectivity changes in the SCN during adjustment
to long and short days. We will record gene expression and intracellular calcium from distinct
classes of neurons within the SCN before, during, and after exposure to long (summer) or short
(winter) days and, using a novel data science method, infer their connectivity. We will evaluate
these inferred networks by using computational models to predict their behavior to control-
theory-inspired perturbations that are then implemented on identified cells in vitro and in vivo.
Taken together, the proposed aims will elevate the SCN into the small class of circuits that has
been mapped with sufficient cellular resolution to allow evaluation of connectivity rules that
support the robust, yet sensitive, network performance. The results from the experiments will lay
a foundation for understanding how the brain is organized as a network of synchronized
circadian cells. We will create methods to reveal functional neural topology and to analyze and
control dynamic structures in complex networks with different spatial and temporal scales.
Ultimately, these experiments will provide guidelines to reveal, and insights to understand, how
diverse network topologies adapt to be robust and yet sensitive to everyday cues."
10994366,"The Common Fund (CF) research initiative has generated a wealth of data that can provide vital context,
origin, and, in some instances, quantitative inferences for biomarkers. However, the systematic harmonization
and organization of biomarker data, as well as their connections to CF data, remain in an early stage and is
currently the focus of the year-long Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Biomarker-Partnership project that
aims to develop a working biomarker data model. The proposed BiomarkerKB project aims to refine and
populate the biomarker data model through a close and dynamic external partnership with the NCI-supported
Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) with built-in community input mechanisms. The initial focus is on
refining our current biomarker data model using EDRN's cancer biomarker data and knowledge. Initially
focusing on cancer will allow us to limit our scope while retaining the ability to evaluate a variety of data types
and therefore ensure extensibility of the model as new data types and technologies emerge. The Minimal
Viable Product (MVP) will include persistent biomarker identifiers, linked data, connections to recognized
standards and ontologies, downloads/APIs, and data access through interfaces for biomarker explorations.
This data model will serve as the cornerstone for AI-ready datasets, machine learning-based biomarker
prediction models, and biomarker knowledge graphs. The scientific use case the project proposes to support is
the ability to explore molecular biomarker-related knowledge for most prevalent cancers at a systems level,
categorized by biological functions through mapping to key ontologies, pathways, biomolecular data (glycans,
proteins, genes, metabolites) and Electronic Health Record (EHR) terms and tests. Example biomarkers
(including non-molecular ones that are of interest to Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs)) for other diseases will
also be considered to ensure the comprehensiveness and robustness of the data model. This project promises
to enrich our understanding of the translational health record and intervention space, revolutionizing the way
we approach diverse diseases, clinical assays, molecular mechanisms, and disease classifications. The
potential benefits extend to our partners in the EDRN and the broader CFDE community, underscoring the
real-world significance of biomarkers across the medical and research landscape."

conference is to promote state-of-the-art research and to enhance scientific discourse and collaborations in the
broad field of intervertebral disc biology. Previous ORS-PSRS conferences have had an excellent track record of
bringing together researchers and clinicians from broad disciplines at various career stages. The key features of
the symposium include, state-of-the-art invited lectures, peer-reviewed presentations, panel discussions, and
trainee and student presentations. Hallmark features of this conference are its relaxed and informal atmosphere
and purposefully unscheduled time to permit interactions and exchange of ideas among participants. The main
theme of the meeting is “Building Bridges” and topics to be highlighted will include molecular, cell, and
developmental biology of the disc, mechanisms of pathogenesis of disc degeneration, the molecular basis of
discogenic pain, biomechanics of the spine, tissue engineering, device design, rehabilitation and technologies
such as AI and virtual reality. The organizers expect participation from basic researchers as well as clinicians
concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of spinal disorders including disc degeneration and back pain."
10994799,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diploid organisms, including humans, create haploid gametes for sexual reproduction through the specialized
cell division program of meiosis. For meiosis to occur successfully, Crossover (CO) repair of DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) is essential, as it creates temporary connections between homologous chromosome
pairs that promote orderly homolog segregation at the first division. Failure to form COs results in aneuploidy,
the leading cause of miscarriage and birth defects in humans. Yet, CO formation relies on the creation of
DSBs, which pose a significant danger to genomic integrity. Meiotic cells must therefore balance the risks
imposed by DSBs with the requirement for COs to promote orderly chromosome segregation. Further, CO
formation is highly limited and constrained: In many organisms, the majority of DSBs are repaired as non-COs
(which restore genomic integrity but do not connect homologous chromosomes), whereas CO recombination
occurs at only a single DSB site per chromosome (or per chromosome arm). This restriction of CO formation
necessitates that each site selected to become a CO must reliably mature as a CO. The paradox of requiring,
yet limiting, CO recombination leads to several major outstanding questions: How are a subset of DSBs
selected to become COs? What are the mechanisms that operate to ensure and limit CO formation? How is
robustness conferred to the process of CO maturation? The proposed research will investigate the
mechanisms that promote and ensure reliable formation of meiotic COs, exploiting genetic and cytological
features of the C. elegans experimental system that make it especially amenable to addressing these issues.
The strategy will focus on COSA-2 (CO-Site Associated), a newly-discovered intrinsically-disordered protein
that I identified as a critical component of the CO machinery. COSA-2 exhibits striking localization to CO-
designated recombination sites and is required for the retention/accumulation of additional CO-promoting
factors at these sites. My preliminary data have led to the hypothesis that COSA-2 promotes CO formation by
acting as a hub protein to concentrate CO-promoting factors, stabilize CO-site architecture, and promote
formation of a protected spatial compartment to ensure CO-specific repair of DSBs. I will test this hypothesis
by: (1) using innovative cytological methodologies and super-resolution microscopy to probe interrelationships
between COSA-2 and known CO factors, CO-site architecture, and meiosis-specific chromosome structures;
(2) identifying COSA-2 protein partners and features of the COSA-2 protein that contribute to its CO-promoting
activity, and (3) using temporally-controlled protein degradation and ectopic recruitment assays to test the
mechanistic role of COSA-2 in CO maturation at natural CO sites and to evaluate whether COSA-2 can drive
formation of CO-site-like compartments and/or stimulate CO-specific repair. Experiments in this proposal will
illuminate fundamental mechanisms that promote reliable formation of the COs needed to direct orderly
chromosome segregation and ensure the faithful inheritance of genomes."
10994892,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks expression of
estrogen receptor (ER-), progesterone receptor (PR-) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-),
the most common targetable markers in breast cancer. TNBC demonstrates the worst overall prognosis among
breast cancer subtypes due to lack of well-established targeted therapies. Because TNBC treatment relies
heavily on non-specific therapies, a significant need exists to identify innovative ways to harness the tumor
immune microenvironment to enable the effective use of immunotherapy.
I propose to investigate how the intracellular protein MALT1 promotes immunosuppression in the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME) in TNBC. MALT1 is the effector protein of the CARMA-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM)
signalosome, a protein complex that is stimulated downstream of certain oncogenic G protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs) and induces pro-survival NF-κB transcriptional activation. MALT1 acts via two main biologic functions:
(1) as a molecular scaffold and (2) as a protease. Our laboratory has demonstrated that in TNBC cells, MALT1
protease activity promotes tumor progression and metastasis by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). In many cancers, including TNBC, malignant cells undergoing EMT modulate the surrounding
microenvironment to polarize immune cells toward a cancer-promoting, immunosuppressive phenotype. Based
on my preliminary data, I hypothesize that MALT1 protease activity within TNBC cells promotes tumor immune
suppression through production of an immunosuppressive secretome.
In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will analyze MALT1 regulation of the TNBC TIME by characterizing MALT1 protease-
dependent secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines from TNBC cells. Experimental techniques utilized in this
aim will include CRISPR/Cas9 editing, mouse breast cancer models, tumor cell/immune cell co-culture, flow
cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing, and Olink® proteomics. In Aim 2 of this proposal, I will evaluate a novel
MALT1 protease activity gene signature for its clinicopathologic utility in predicting TIME status in TNBC.
Experimental techniques utilized in this aim will include use of patient-derived organoids, analysis of patient
tumor specimens, multiplex multispectral immunofluorescence, and a series of in silico analyses.
In summary, this project evaluates MALT1 protease as a potential driver of tumor progression via its effects on
the TNBC TIME. Completion of this proposal will provide me with rigorous research training by a remarkable
team of scientists and physician-scientists. This training experience will prepare me for a career as a physician-
scientist who develops new and innovative strategies for the treatment of patients with malignant solid tumors."
10985654,"Abstract:
Seasonal influenza causes a significant burden of disease in low-middle income countries, specifically in some
of the most vulnerable populations such as infants, pregnant women, and the elderly. Influenza spreads
primarily within households and while this has been extensively studied in the high-income countries, there
remains a significant gap in the literature around household transmission of influenza in low-middle income
countries. Differences in population structure, household membership, vaccine availability, and contact
patterns make it difficult to apply knowledge from high to low-middle income countries. Understanding
household transmission of influenza in this setting will help to generate key epidemiologic parameters of
influenza such as secondary attack rate and help to model potential interventions to decrease transmission.
This K23 offers an outstanding opportunity to leverage respiratory and serologic samples from a household-
based cohort with self-reported and sensor-based social contact data who were followed prospectively for any
respiratory illness in three low-middle income countries: Guatemala, Mozamique, India. Our approach will be to
use established molecular techniques including hemagglutination inhibition assay and RT-PCR to calculate
seroprevalence curves, the force of infection, and with-in household secondary attack rates. We will the
develop a heterogenous chain binomial model of within household transmission by incorporating household
contact data and risk of infectious between pairs of individuals in the household. Aim 1 is to quantify the spread
of with-in household transmission of influenza. Aim 2 is to develop a heterogenous chain binomial model of
within household transmission with the hopes of projecting how effective different interventions such as
vaccination and masking are in mitigating intra-household influenza transmission. To complete this project, I
will require additional training in infectious disease modeling, advanced methods in infectious disease
quantification, influenza epidemiology and emerging infectious diseases. To help ensure this projects success,
I am surrounded an international team of experts in influenza epidemiology and infectious disease modeling
with whom I have established relationships. This K23 award would provide the crucial link in my career from
having a foundation in infectious disease epidemiology to having an expertise in infectious disease modeling.
At the end of this award period, I will be prepared to submit a strong NIH R01 application focused on modeling
emerging infectious diseases transmission in low-resource settings."

The proposed 5-year K23 award describes a research training program for Kristina Suorsa-Johnson, PhD, a
licensed pediatric psychologist who specializes in differences of sex development (DSD). Her overarching
career goal is to become an independently funded investigator focused on improving the psychosocial and
health outcomes of pediatric patients with DSD by creating tools to facilitate patient engagement in medical
decision making through shared decision making (SDM). This award provides support for Dr. Suorsa-Johnson
to achieve the following Career Development Aims: Aim 1: Obtain expertise in SDM, including the
development of decision aids (DAs) for adolescents and young adults (AYAs); Aim 2: Gain sexual health
education training, particularly as it relates to the creation of educational materials to enhance surgical SDM;
Aim 3: Develop expertise in evaluating and implementing DAs; and Aim 4: Expand and strengthen research
leadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson has assembled a dedicated
team of mentors and advisors with expertise in SDM (Angela Fagerlin, PhD), SDM in AYAs (Ellen Lipstein,
MD), sexual health education (Jordan Rullo, PhD), dissemination and implementation science (Jennie Hill,
PhD), qualitative design and clinical trials (Melissa Watt, PhD and Angela Fagerlin, PhD), multi-site trial design
(Gregory Stoddard, MBA, MPH), urogenital/gonadal surgeries in AYAs (Kathleen van Leeuwen, PhD), and
DSD education (David Sandberg, PhD and Erica Weidler, MEd, MS). A person with lived experience, Noi
Liang, MBA, MCPA, is consulting to ensure all aspects of the project align with the needs of those with DSD.
DSD are congenital conditions where chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex development is atypical. AYAs
with DSD make critical and potentially irreversible, life-altering urogenital/gonadal surgical decisions. However,
we know little about how AYAs approach surgical decision making and no standardized SDM resources exist.
As such, Dr. Suorsa-Johnson proposes to create and pilot a set of surgical DAs for AYAs with DSD. This will
be achieved through three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Identify informational needs and values influencing surgical
decision making for AYAs with DSD; Aim 2: Develop a set of evidence-based DAs for surgical decisions to
facilitate SDM for AYAs and their caregivers; and Aim 3: Pilot test and refine DA content, delivery, and
feasibility. This project will result in a set of surgical decision aids ready to be tested in a multi-site trial.
This project is significant because it will change how we provide care and improve engagement in surgical
decision making for this underserved, NIH-designated sexual and gender minority subpopulation. This
innovative project is the first to explore the needs of AYAs with DSD making surgical decisions from a SDM
framework and create associated decision support tools."
10985655,"Strength loss occurs with age affecting quality of life and impinges upon healthspan. 17β-estradiol (E2)
deficiency in females also causes strength loss. The overall goal of this project is to determine the cellular and
molecular mechanisms through which E2 deficiency perturbs skeletal muscle and contractile functions with
age. The sole focus of our research has been on aging females and in this competitive renewal submission,
we also seek to determine mechanisms of E2 in male muscle as the impact of estrogens in male non-
reproductive physiology is becoming increasingly recognized. Results from the previous funding periods have
led to novel hypotheses outlined in this proposal. Specifically, Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that E2 signals
through estrogen receptor α (ERα) and the G protein-coupled ER (GPER) in skeletal muscle to enhance
dynamic strength in male as well as female mice. We use genetic, surgical, and pharmacologic approaches to
probe both the ligand and receptor sides of E2-ER signaling. We pair this approach with comprehensive in
vivo and in vitro measures of muscle contractile functions to elucidate mechanisms and determine the long-
term consequence of E2-ER disruption in muscle. While the particular muscle proteins to be analyzed in the
first aim are guided by specific contractile outcomes that are affected by E2-ER signaling, Aim 2 takes an
unbiased approach to quantitate phosphoproteins that are critical for strength yet altered in aged and E2-
deficient muscle. This will be accomplished through the development of a novel parallel reaction monitoring
(PRM) assay with computational modeling, which is based on our global phosphoproteomic work that
identified differentially expressed phospho-peptides related to calcium signaling and contractile proteins in
several E2-replete vs E2-deficient muscle conditions. Our customized PRM assay will further predict
candidate E2-sensitive kinases that will be validated in high-throughput assays to yield potential
gerotherapeutic targets for preserving muscle strength with age. It has been shown that 17alpha-E2, the minor
and weak epimer of E2, extends lifespan and improves several characteristics of healthspan in male mice.
Aim 3 is designed to test the hypothesis that skeletal muscle will be enhanced by 17alpha-E2 in both aged
males and females through activation of ERα and downstream signaling. This aim brings forth the intriguing
prospect that 17alpha-E2 is a non-feminizing geroprotector that extends healthspan by supporting muscle
strength and thus physical activity, movement, and quality of life. Accomplishing these three aims will solidify
that change in sex hormones and their receptors is one of the pleiotropic mechanisms underlying muscle
weakness with age and addresses the long-term goal of our research program, which is to determine
estrogenic mechanisms that preserve strength with aging, regardless of sex."
10985731,"Addressing the long-term care needs of a growing number of older individuals with Alzheimer's disease and
related dementias (AD/ADRD) is one of the most daunting challenges facing the U.S. public health safety net.
AD/ADRD is one of the most expensive categories of chronic conditions in the U.S. Older adults with AD/ADRDs
have complex long-term care needs for medical, behavioral, and social supports. Medicaid is the public program
that is chiefly responsible for paying the costs of long-term care supports and services (LTSS) for older adults
with AD/ADRD who have exhausted their resources and ability to pay for needed long-term care. A growing
trend in Medicaid programs has been to support older individuals with AD/ADRD at home rather than in nursing
homes by offering Medicaid enrollees greater access to Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) services,
such as in-home personal care services and case management. The rapid rise of Medicaid HCBS and home-
based AD/ADRD care has served to highlight a growing problem of lack of coordination of Medicaid HCBS and
other needed chronic care management services by duals’ primary health insurance carrier, which is Medicare.
The long-term goal of this project is to provide an evidence base for viable solutions to this Medicare-Medicaid
coordination problem. Medicare Advantage (MA) Dual Eligible Special Needs Plans (D-SNPs) are private
managed care plans that only enroll dual eligible individuals. A special type of integrated D-SNP that combines
Medicare Advantage and Medicaid benefits under one managed care provider may result in better care
coordination, longer community tenure, less nursing home use, and improved health outcomes among older
disadvantaged individuals with AD/ADRD. This project uses nationwide linked Medicare-Medicaid administrative
data to compare the effectiveness of integrated D-SNPs to non-integrated D-SNPs among duals with AD/ADRD
based on the results of three analyses. The first analysis compares HBCS use among duals with AD/ADRD in
integrated and non-integrated D-SNPs; the second analysis compares in-home service and prescription drug
process quality indicators among duals with AD/ADRD in integrated and non-integrated D-SNPs; and the third
analysis compares nursing home use, community tenure, and plan disenrollment among duals with AD/ADRD
in integrated and non-integrated D-SNPs. This project uses linked Medicare and Medicaid managed care
encounter data from the years 2021-2023. The final project dataset will contain over 150,000 year-quarter
observations on D-SNP enrollees from over 250 unique D-SNPs. This project will be among the first to
comprehensively describe both Medicaid and Medicare service use among duals with AD/ADRD. With
assistance from project partners, the results will be disseminated to a broad stakeholder audience of Medicaid
officials, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and policy advocates for individuals with
AD/ADRD conditions."
10990497,"Effective treatment of central apnea remains elusive. This project is focused on identifying mechanistic
pathways to guide future therapeutic interventions for central sleep apnea (CSA) based on the strong premise
that multi-modality therapy - aiming to normalize respiration- is the requisite path to mitigating the long-term
adverse consequences of CSA. Our central hypothesis is that CSA reflects a combination of physiologic
perturbations and may require combined modality therapy targeting different parts of the ventilatory feedback
loop. Our proposed studies will test combination therapies, including PAP plus a pharmacological agent. This
will also increase the clinical relevance of the proposed studies since PAP therapy is typically prescribed as the
initial treatment of CSA. We propose to modify CSA propensity via three distinct physiologic pathways: 1)
decreasing loop gain with oxygen and/or acetazolamide, 2) decreasing ventilatory overshoot by dampening
respiratory arousals with a hypnotic agent, and 3) elevating the ventilatory motor output with a serotonergic
agent. To ensure clinical relevance, we will focus on the two most common types of CSA: 1) heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and 2) opioid use, using stratified randomization to balance the number of
subjects in each arm of each experiment. To achieve the objectives of this proposal, we will test the following
three specific aims. Specific Aim (1) is to determine the effect of combination therapy aiming to dampen
chemoreceptor sensitivity AND decreasing plant gain. We hypothesize that combined therapy with PAP,
acetazolamide and oxygen will be superior to each intervention alone in reducing CAHI and the CO2 reserve
during sleep in patients with central sleep apnea. Specific Aim (2) is to determine the effect of decreasing
respiratory-related arousals on the propensity to develop central apnea. We hypothesize that administration of
PAP and zolpidem, will decrease respiratory-related arousals, CAHI and the CO2 reserve during sleep in
patients with CSA compared to placebo. Specific Aim (3) is to determine the effect of augmenting serotonin
A1 receptor activity on breathing during sleep. We hypothesize that administration of PAP and buspirone, a
serotonin A1 receptor agonist; will reduce the propensity to central apnea during sleep in Veterans with central
sleep apnea. This Novel project seeks to identify physiologic pathways that can, in combination with PAP
therapy, improve the effectiveness of treatment for patients with CSA. The proposed studies are innovative,
feasible and will provide a much-needed roadmap for future clinical trials that are likely to transform the care of
central apnea in Veterans."
10990578,"Summary
The primary aim of this 90-day randomized trial in older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and mild dementia will
determine whether nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a NAD+ precursor, crosses the blood-brain barrier,
and engages the hypothesized target mechanism. We hypothesize that βNMN administration will cross the
blood-brain barrier and increase brain NAD+ concentrations. This application for administrative supplement
requests funds to support the addition of a second clinical trial site to expedite participant recruitment and
enable the completion of the trial and accomplishment of the proposed aims of the project.
This request for supplemental funds was necessitated by the delay in trial's completion due to multiple
unanticipated factors that included: 1) longer than expected time for securing Food and Drug Administration's
approval of the IND; 2) longer than expected time for IRB review of the study protocol; 3) unanticipated
mechanical problems with the head coil required for the 7T magnetic resonance spectroscopy which delayed
trial's initiation; 4) reluctance of the many participants to undergo lumbar puncture for the collection of the
cerebrospinal fluid; 5) participants excluded because of ineligibility for lumbar puncture or 7T MRS; 6) a large
number of competing AD trials in the Boston metropolitan area; and 7) in the wake of the COVID pandemic,
many older adults, especially those with AD, have been reluctant to come into a healthcare facility for research
studies. To overcome these barriers and expedite enrollment, we have made several changes in the study
protocol with the approval of the DSMB, IRB, and program staff; added a recruiter at BWH; and plan to add a
second trial site at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) under the leadership of Dr. Daniel Press,
an NIH-funded investigator and cognitive neurologist with expertise in conducting AD clinical trials. We plan to
continue to randomize an average of 1 participant each month at the BWH site and will have enrolled an
additional 9 participants at the BWH site. The BIDMC site also will enroll one participant per month for a total of
8 subjects over the next 8 months. This should enable us to complete the enrollment by August 31, 2024, with
the last participant completing the intervention by November 30, 2024. The data clean-up, data-lock, analyses
and preparation of the primary manuscript will take an additional 4 months. We will request a no cost extension
for one year. We are requesting supplemental funds to support the trial activities at BIDMC site and a nominal
additional effort (7.5%) for the Project Manager for project coordination and additional administrative and
reporting tasks. This planned addition of a second trial site has been discussed and approved by the trial's
DSMB and the program staff. The cost saving associated with fewer laboratory tests, procedures, and subject
payments due to fewer subjects having been enrolled will be carried forward to support the BWH site during
the no-cost extension year and no additional funds have been requested for these activities."

The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) was designated as a National Cancer Institute (NCI)
Cancer Center in 1972 and gained comprehensive status in 1979. The HICCC is the critical driver of cancer
scientific research, clinical trials, innovative patient care, cancer education and training and community outreach
at Columbia University’s Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). During
the current project period (2014-present), CUIMC and NYPH committed $415M for the following: (1) new
research initiatives in basic, translational, clinical and population sciences with >50 strategic faculty recruitments;
(2) new and expanded facilities for laboratory research, dry bench research and clinical activities; (3) major
faculty recruitments; and, (4) support of the HICCC’s administrative core. A major aspect was the recruitment
of Anil K. Rustgi, MD as the HICCC Director in late 2018. Rustgi has the unequivocal authority over cancer
research space and cancer care facilities and accompanying substantial resources through the transformative
Irving Family Trust Gift, further reinforced through his dual roles as Associate Dean of Oncology (CUIMC) and

The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of
Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke
Health in October 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and
in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Health,
including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new
initiatives, and a commitment for ongoing annual investment by the Duke Health System. DCI faculty include
well-established and funded experts spanning the full spectrum of cancer research fields, from intracellular
signaling to cancer genomics to therapeutic development and testing to population science. DCI programmatic
activities support the career development of the next generation of cancer experts and provide platforms for
multi-disciplinary scientific teams to develop and test new hypotheses. During the most recent funding period,
the DCI structure has continued to evolve and mature, currently consisting of 304 members from 34 departments
within 7 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Public Policy,
Environment, and Business) and organized as 8 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1
population science, and 5 translational/clinical) whose work is supported by 14 Shared Resources (8 lab-based
and 6 supporting translational/clinical/population research activities). In addition to Program and Shared
Resource leaders, DCI senior leadership, which includes an Executive Director, Deputy Director, 7 Associate
Directors, and 8 other key leaders, provides oversight and direction of DCI initiatives. DCI members are currently
supported by over $111M of external cancer-related grant support (direct costs), over $63M of which is peer-
reviewed, including 32 peer-reviewed, multi-investigator grants (involving 81 subprojects/cores) and 61 training
and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 5,750 cancer-focused papers during the past funding
period, ~40% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators. On average, ~7,000 new
cancer patients are seen each year at the Duke University Hospital. In 2018, DCI Programs enrolled over 4,000
patients on clinical trials, including nearly 2,000 interventional accruals and 770 therapeutic accruals. DCI is
heavily engaged in both community outreach/engagement and educating the next generation of cancer clinicians
and scientists. Duke Health support of the DCI included a total of over $65M of additional investment in the most
recent funding period, including support for recruitment, retention, and protected academic time for DCI faculty.
The DCI completed an extensive 5-year Strategic Planning process, identifying strategic goals and priorities that
enable the DCI mission to “Discover, Develop, and Deliver the future of cancer care…now”, resulting in a series
of discrete recommendations that are serving as a guide for determining current and future resource allocation,
recruiting priorities, and infrastructure changes required to achieve DCI goals."

There is a strong public health need to detect Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in its earliest stages and predict who is
most vulnerable to clinical progression. The goal of this K23 proposal is to provide the candidate with the
experience, knowledge, and technical expertise to independently investigate novel early predictors of risk for
and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline. The career development plan comprises a complementary
set of training and research activities to support the candidate’s transition to independence. Specific training
goals include: 1) to develop expertise in using electroencephalography (EEG) to assess brain network
dynamics in aging populations; 2) to increase depth of knowledge of functional neuroanatomy, with a focus on
frontal networks compromised early in the course of AD; 3) to gain specialized training in clinical research
design and statistics, with an emphasis on dimension reduction and analysis of complex data; and 4) to receive
formal mentorship in professional development. The training plan draws on an exemplary interdisciplinary team
with expertise in the electroencephalography (S. Jones), cognitive neuroscience and functional neuroanatomy
(Heindel), statistical methods and the cognitive reserve hypothesis (R. Jones), and clinical neuropsychology
(Tremont). Training activities will take place through formal mentorship, experiential laboratory training,
didactics, and the completion of a rigorous research project. The scientific objective of the research project is
to investigate behavioral and electrophysiological markers of frontal control network integrity that may serve as
novel markers of risk for and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline. Each research aim corresponds to
a complementary area of training. Specific aims include 1) to examine behavioral and electrophysiological
markers of frontal network dynamics in older adults at risk for AD; 2) to validate the behavioral and
electrophysiological markers using independent measures of frontal network integrity (i.e., magnetic resonance
imaging); and 3) to validate the markers as indices of cognitive resilience. The research project will leverage
the infrastructure of the Rhode Island Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention Registry, a large cohort of older adults
whose cognition is monitored annually. Successful completion of these interrelated training and research
activities will foster the candidate’s development into an independent clinical researcher with expertise in the
early prediction of risk for and resilience to AD-associated cognitive decline."
10995759,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In the United States, emerging adults consume alcohol at higher rates than people in any other age group.
Relative to four-year college students and graduates, emerging adults who are not students or graduates of
four-year colleges (N4YCEAs) experience greater alcohol-related health consequences, a health disparity that
persists across the lifespan. In recognition of this disparity, the NIAAA and the U.S. Institute of Medicine have
both identified improving the provision of care to N4YCEAs as a significant public health priority.
Evidence-based brief alcohol interventions (BAIs) have demonstrated effectiveness among N4YCEAs in
multiple clinical trials, rendering them ideal candidates for broadscale implementation. Unfortunately, there is
limited availability of BAIs in the settings where N4YCEAs typically receive services and N4YCEAs are unlikely
to engage with alcohol-focused interventions even when they are available. To expand the impact of BAIs for
N4YCEAs, appealing BAIs must be implemented in settings that N4YCEAs frequent. Therefore, research into
N4YCEA preferences is an essential step toward increasing the impact of BAIs for N4YCEAs and decreasing
the alcohol-related health inequity experienced by this underserved population.
The proposed project seeks to identify the preferences of U.S. N4YCEAs for engaging in BAIs, to examine
local perspectives on the implementation of BAIs in the Memphis area, and to identify the barriers and
facilitators to implementing a BAI in a community setting in Memphis. We will employ a community-engaged
approach, collaborating with a community advisory board throughout the project. Our specific aims are 1) to
use semi-structured interviews with local and national N4YCEAs to understand where N4YCEAs may be open
to engaging with BAIs, 2) to use a discrete choice experiment to investigate the preferences of U.S. N4YCEAs
for engaging in BAIs, and 3) to use semi-structured interviews with N4YCEAs, providers, and administrators to
investigate the facilitators and barriers to implementing a BAI that N4YCEAs will find appealing in a community
setting in Memphis, enabling the identification of ideal implementation strategies that future implementation
researchers can use to achieve these outcomes.
This project lays the foundation for an innovative program of research. Through this project – and with support
from a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors – the applicant will develop the capacity to conduct mixed
methods community-engaged implementation research, and he will expand his expertise in BAI research. The
supervised experience from this project will empower him to become an independent investigator conducting
mixed methods community-engaged research on the adaptation and implementation of brief interventions to
reduce the health burden of alcohol use."
10995913,"ABSTRACT
People with disabilities are significantly more likely to experience chronic conditions and are at risk of dying up
to 20 years earlier than people without disabilities due largely to systemic and persistent health inequities.
Appalachian Kentucky, an underserved rural area, has twice the U.S. rate of disability—22.7% compared with
12.6% nationally. Rates of new or “acquired disability” are escalating as medical advances allow more people
to survive hospitalization and live with disability, yet we lack the knowledge to help people live well post-
hospitalization. Specifically, while formal medical care plays an invaluable role in saving the lives of people who
experience an acute health event, these survivors and their families are often left to manage the enduring
challenges of living with acquired disability on their own. I propose a mixed methods ethnographic investigation
to understand the nature of acquired disability, including subsequent care throughout the life course, in the
disproportionately affected rural communities of Appalachian Kentucky. Ethnographic studies enable a
holistic—personal, environmental, sociocultural, and political—perspective to understand individuals’ lived
experiences and identify opportunities to reduce adverse health outcomes. Long-term health is intimately
intertwined with broader cultural and structural factors that contribute to significant health disparities for rural,
disabled, and underserved populations, including informal (family and social relations), formal (health and
human services), and institutional (policy and programs) forms of care. Consistent with the socioecological
model, I will identify multilevel factors impacting quality of life and long-term health and identify strategies to
reduce health inequities. Obtaining grounded insights on how disability amplifies existing inequalities is
necessary to inform health, policy, and structural interventions to improve quality of life and long-term health for
people with disabilities. I propose two related aims: (1) to ethnographically investigate and describe
experiences of acquired disability among those with disabilities, family caregivers, health and human service
providers and policymakers and (2) to develop and verify a shared cultural model of disability describing the
range of barriers, facilitators, and opportunities to help rural Appalachians live well with disability. To achieve
these aims, I will obtain rigorous training in rapid ethnographic assessment, concept mapping, culturally
adapted interventions, and grant writing to support my growth as an independent health equity researcher. A
robust understanding of disability based on grounded experiences will inform future culturally adapted
interventions to mitigate health inequities and improve the lives of people with disabilities and their families."
10995521,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability in the United States and worldwide, yet current
pharmacologic treatment options are insufficient for many patients. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
(rTMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-approved treatment that utilizes electromagnetic pulses to modulate brain activity,
but clinical efficacy is inconsistent, and the mechanism of action is still being determined. Understanding how
rTMS alters glutamate (Glu) signaling and functional connectivity (FC) in the Salience Network (SN), a functional
brain network that regulates attentional and emotional processing, could pave the way for improving or
personalizing this promising intervention. Previous studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy or resting-
state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) at 3T have reported that rTMS increases Glu and FC in
the SN. However, methodological limitations contribute to extensive heterogeneity in this literature. This proposal
aims to overcome these limitations by applying robust, cutting-edge, ultra-high field (UHF; 7T) neuroimaging
techniques, including Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) and rsfMRI, that confer
unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We aim to elucidate the manner in which rTMS alters Glu (Aim
1) and FC (Aim 2) in the SN, and how this associates with clinical improvement, as measured by our
comprehensive psychological assessment. The overarching hypothesis is that the antidepressant effect of rTMS
stems from increased glutamatergic activity and FC in key SN regions that regulate activity across functional
networks. Our high spatial resolution, multimodal imaging approach will provide unprecedented mechanistic
insights into the effects of rTMS and the role of Glu in the pathophysiology of MDD. To further investigate
individual differences in treatment response, we will employ an exploratory multivariate model incorporating Glu,
FC, and proximity of the stimulation site to the SN (Aim 2.3, exploratory). This project would both advance our
ability to predict outcomes for individuals receiving rTMS therapy and build the applicant’s skills in human
neuroimaging, neuromodulation, interventional psychiatry, and scientific communication in an environment with
clear expertise in these areas. A world-class mentoring team – Dr. David Roalf, Dr. Desmond Oathes, Dr.
Theodore Satterthwaite, and Dr. Kristin Linn – will provide complementary advising and resources in research
and clinical arenas as the candidate gains independence over the course of the project. With a detailed training
plan aligned with innovative scientific aims, this NRSA is the ideal opportunity for the candidate to develop key
skills to undertake not only strong experimental and computational work, but also care for patients with mood
disorders while effectively tailoring her research to the needs of this patient population as an interventional
psychiatrist-scientist."
10982264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human functional neuroimaging literature has experienced sustained and explosive growth, making it
difficult to effectively glean insights from this vast knowledge base. Previously, we introduced Neurosynth, a
web-based framework for automated fMRI synthesis that supports meta-analysis at scale across over 12,000
studies. We subsequently extended the ecosystem by developing a powerful platform for expert-driven data
annotation, enabling researchers to define and execute custom image-based meta-analyses. Although the
Neurosynth framework has become a widely used resource in the neuroimaging community, the laborious
challenge of annotating studies at scale remains. We previously addressed this problem by using
frequency-based text-mining techniques to extract meaning from the abstracts of articles, but these methods
were unable to make fine-grained distinctions between neuroscientific concepts or encode methodological
details. Recent breakthroughs in natural language processing and artificial intelligence promise to extract
accurate information from unstructured texts with little to no labeled data using Zero Shot Learning. However,
the application of state-of-the-art language models to the neuroimaging literature requires a systematic
framework to ensure machine comprehension accurately captures known concepts, and robust infrastructure
to retrieve information from the literature at scale. The overarching goal of the present project period is to
bridge the gap between manual annotation and fully automated meta-analysis, by extending the Neurosynth
framework to leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing models to enable precise large-scale
automated meta-analysis. In Aim 1, we will develop an extensible framework for information retrieval and
validation from neuroimaging articles, with a focus on features relevant to neuroimaging meta-analysis such as
study participant demographics (e.g. sample size, age, phenotype), methodological details, and semantic
concepts mapped onto expert-defined ontologies. In Aim 2, we will develop and deploy infrastructure for
continuous retrieval and processing of the neuroimaging literature, ensuring the timely acquisition of new
articles and transforming our meta-analytic study database into a comprehensive knowledge base. In Aim 3,
we will develop an interactive researcher-in-the-loop platform meta-analysis, enabling users to use extracted
study information to find and identify studies, create gold-standard meta-analyses, and browse hundreds of
pre-generated large-scale meta-analyses, enabling discovery-driven science. Meta-analyses will be
automatically updated, transforming them from a static to a “living” scientific product that remains relevant and
up-to-date. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful and flexible tools for synthesizing the
neuroimaging literature at a large scale and with unprecedented precision and ease. These tools will be freely
and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient meta-analysis across
a broad range of clinical and basic research questions."
10980735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood that leads to a disproportionate
number of childhood cancer deaths and an even more disproportionate death rate in Black children. Despite the
addition of GD2 antibody (dinutuximab) immunotherapy, disparities in outcome remain, suggesting racial/ethnic
differences in immunity may contribute to NB patient health inequity. While social determinants of health (SDOH)
like household poverty have been found to play a role in outcome disparities for high risk NB, biologic factors
contributing to racial disparities in NB survival are largely unexplored.
Dinutuximab requires innate effector immune cells to enact antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) for
efficacy. We have found that the presence of circulating cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells is associated with
objective responses to dinutuximab in a phase I trial for patients with relapsed NB. Furthermore, innate immune
cell infiltrates in high-risk NB tumors may differ between Black and non-Hispanic White patients, with Black
patients having more exhausted tumor-resident NK cells. We therefore hypothesize that racial differences in
high-risk NB patient innate immune cell landscapes, due to genomic ancestry and SDOH exposures, contribute
to outcome disparities following GD2 immunotherapy.
A Children’s Oncology Group randomized phase III trial will evaluate whether the addition of dinutuximab to
induction chemotherapy (“induction chemoimmunotherapy”) will improve event-free survival (EFS) and overall
survival (OS) for newly diagnosed high-risk NB patients. The trial includes a novel embedded health equity
substudy to capture parent-reported race and SDOH. The goal of this proposal is to utilize trial-derived biologic
samples to: i) Perform tumor based single cell genomic, proteomic, and functional investigations before and after
chemoimmunotherapy to determine tumor immune microenvironment markers influencing EFS/OS, ii) Perform
immunophenotyping and functional assays to define peripheral host immune markers influencing EFS/OS, and
iii) Explore the associations between tumor and host immune landscapes and parent-reported race, adverse
SDOH, child DNA-based genetic ancestry, and clinical outcomes.
At the conclusion of this project, we will have defined immune biomarkers of EFS/OS across all patients and
evaluated immune biomarkers of poor EFS/OS to see if they are enriched in Black children and/or children
exposed to adverse SDOH. Importantly, these findings may identify new immunotherapeutic targets for specific
patient populations to improve survival and achieve health equity in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma."
10980736,"Interoception includes processes by which an organism senses, integrates, interprets, and
regulates internal signals that contribute to physiological processes such as eating. In this context,
more is known about ascending brain pathways for postoral signals than about descending
pathways (e.g. central regulators) that alter processing of this sensory information. In fact, NIH
has identified our limited understanding of how forebrain central regulators modulate ascending
interoceptive signals and its impact on behavior as critical knowledge gaps. Importantly, eating is
not only regulated by postoral sensory signals but also by oral sensory signals (e.g. taste). Despite
its public health importance, major gaps exist in our understanding of how central regulator nuclei
influence neural coding of ascending sensory information and its impact on ingestive behavior.
This proposal seeks to broaden our knowledge of how an anatomically/molecularly defined central
regulator pathway contributes to taste coding and ingestive behavior. We have identified
amygdala (CeA) cells that express GABA and somatostatin (Sst) as a source of several distinct
central regulator pathways. One such pathway provides input to a region of the pons called the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN - CeA/Sst-to-PBN pathway). The PBN is critical to processing oral and
postoral signals that strongly influence the foodstuff an animal chooses to ingest. Our central
premise is that this central regulator pathway mediates, in part, the neural processing of
interoceptive information and, consequently, influences ingestive behavior. We will use Sst-cre
mice in conjunction with cre-dependent retrograde viruses to specifically label and
optogenetically manipulate CeA/Sst neurons. Our complimentary aims will expand knowledge of
how CeA/Sst-to-PBN neurons influence ingestive behavior driven by oral and postoral signals,
neural processing of taste information in the PBN, and neural activity of other CeA/Sst regulator
neurons that differ in terms of where they project in the brainstem (i.e. NST vs. PBN)."
10980739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most bacteria maintain a cell wall, an essential, mesh-like structure mainly comprising the polysaccharide
peptidoglycan (PG). Some of our most powerful antibiotics, the b-lactams (penicillins, carbapenems and
cephalosporins) target enzymes required for cell wall synthesis and derive their efficacy from their ability to not
only inhibit cell wall biogenesis, but also to actively cause its destruction. Cell wall destruction after exposure to
b-lactams is mediated by “autolysins”, a group of enzymes (amidases, lytic transglycosylases and
endopeptidase) with the capacity to cut a variety of chemical bonds within the PG mesh. Under normal growth
conditions, autolysins engage in important cell wall remodeling functions, such as PG mesh expansion during
cell elongation; how these functions are regulated to ensure proper PG maintenance is poorly understood. We
have shown that in the diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the endopeptidases (EPs) ShyA and ShyC are
required for cell elongation during normal growth, but are also key factors mediating cell wall breakdown after
exposure to beta lactam antibiotics. How ShyA and ShyC are regulated to ensure proper cell wall maintenance
in the absence of antibiotics is unknown. Here, we propose experiments to build a thorough understanding of
mechanisms of endopeptidase regulation in V. cholerae on multiple levels. Since M23 EPs are well-conserved
throughout Bacteria, our experiments will likely yield insights with broad relevance to other pathogens.
Leveraging extensive preliminary screens, we will i) establish how EPs are co-ordinated with PG synthesis, ii)
interrogate the functional interaction between EPs and other autolysins, and iii) determine the role of proteolytic
processing in EP activity regulation. Taken together, these experiments will provide us with an extensive
framework of how bacteria maintain the balance between cell wall synthesis and remodeling, which could
ultimately lead to the discovery of new potential targets for antibiotics that modulate autolysin activity."
10981951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Uterine fibroids are the most common pelvic tumors in women of reproductive age, coming to clinical
attention in one in four women. Fibroids are 2-3 times as common among Black women compared to White
women. Each year, fibroids result in $2.2 billion in health care costs and account for over 200,000
hysterectomies. Despite significant quality of life and health care costs associated with fibroids, few modifiable,
factors have been identified, and it is unknown why Black women are disproportionately affected. A major barrier
to understanding the relative contributions of established and yet-to-be identified risk factors that may contribute
to the fibroid disparity is that no single study has adequate numbers of both Black and White women to apply
advanced epidemiologic methods (e.g., mediation analyses, population attribute risks) to evaluate these
differences. Further, while an association between perceived interpersonal racism and fibroids has been shown,
no studies have examined the role of structural racism in fibroid incidence. We propose to study women from
two prospective U.S. cohorts — Black women from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS) and White women
from the Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII) — to identify factors that explain the differences in fibroid incidence
between Black and White women. Among 59,000 participants (6,200+ newly diagnosed cases) in the BWHS
and 116,429 (8,100+ newly diagnosed cases) in the NHSII, we will examine the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Determine if established fibroid risk factors (e.g., parity, age at menarche, smoking, body size),
which differ in prevalence or timing between Black and White women, contribute to racial disparities in the risk
of uterine fibroids. We will calculate race-specific population attributable fractions to identify the proportion of
fibroids cases that are attributable to each risk factor and summarize the impact of differences in the
distribution of fibroids risk factors by race on fibroids incidence using a novel average odds ratio method.
 Aim 2. Determine if environmental and neighborhood-level factors, including structural racism,
contribute to the racial disparities in the risk of uterine fibroids.
 Aim 3. Estimate the contribution of multiple factors simultaneously to the fibroids incidence disparity
between Black and White women using multiple mediation analysis. Factors to be considered for inclusion into
the mediation models include reproductive, lifestyle, psychosocial, and environmental factors, and measures of
structural racism.
 Given that more than 25% of women experience fibroids, the potential health and economic impact of
this novel study is substantial. Black women suffer disproportionately from fibroids, but the reasons for this
disparity are not understood. The identification factors that contribute to the racial disparity in fibroid incidence
could lay the groundwork for identifying strategies that would reduce fibroid incidence, particularly among Black
women."
10981559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the fundamental questions in development is how cellular diversity arises from a single genome template.
The metazoan genome non-randomly organized within nuclei, and this organization is thought to underlie cell
type specific gene expression. In brain development, how genome organization relates to cell identity may be a
particularly challenging question, as neural progenitors sequentially give rise to distinct neural cell types, and the
incredible cellular diversity arises from a limited progenitor pool. Neural progenitors transit through distinct states
of competence, or potential, which restricts the period they can generate each cell type; this ordered production
of neurons gives rise to the organized tissue structure underlying brain function. How neural progenitor
competence is regulated and how it changes over time is not understood. At the interface of neurodevelopment
and genome architecture, we are studying mechanisms of competence regulation in vivo by asking how the three
dimensional organization of the neural progenitor genome contributes to gene expression in the neuron.
 While progress in high throughput sequencing has revealed the basic principles of genome folding at
multiple scales, what level of organization ultimately relates to gene expression and cell function remain mostly
unknown. This is largely because genome organization is highly context specific, and cell type and stage specific
genomic data is challenging to obtain and to validate in vivo. Further, there is a dearth of knowledge of genome
architecture regulators and the mechanisms of their functions. We have established Drosophila embryo
neuroblasts (NBs, fly neural progenitor) as model to study how genome organization relates to NB competence
in vivo. We found that the hunchback (hb) gene, a master regulator gene for early-born neurons, relocates to the
NB nuclear periphery at mid-embryogenesis. This relocation event within the NB progenitor heritably silences
the hb gene, rendering it refractory to activation in the descendent neuron. Thus, changes in hb gene positioning
within the NB terminates competence to specify early-born molecular identity of the neuron. We discovered a
cis-acting gene mobility element within the hb intron that is both necessary and sufficient for hb gene relocation
to the NB nuclear lamina, a first clue in understanding how genes mobilize relative to the nuclear periphery. We
have also identified multiple trans-acting factors that regulate hb gene relocation in vivo, laying the groundwork
to test how distinct nuclear architecture regulators orchestrate developmentally-timed genome reorganization.
 Here we will purify NBs from different developmental stages to profile genome-wide chromatin interactions
in vivo and examine the role of NB nuclear factors in genome architecture reorganization. We will also test how
the phase-separation properties of one such NB factor contributes to the timing of genome reorganization.
Together, our proposed studies will generate new mechanistic insights underlying NB genome architecture
dynamics, the role that trans-acting factors play to coordinate the timing of genome reorganization, and ultimately
how these changes in genome structures impact specification of neural identity."
10985415,"ABSTRACT
This project combines the mutual expertise of Drs. Patrick Rothwell and Swati More (Principal Investigators) in
nucleus accumbens opioid signaling and medicinal chemistry. As part of an ongoing collaboration supported by
NIDA (R21 DA050120), we have found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has a non-canonical function
in the nucleus accumbens: it degrades Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF) and thereby regulates endogenous
opioid signaling. Conventional ACE inhibitors block the degradation of MERF, leading to an enhancement of
endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens. This causes a selective reduction of glutamate release
onto medium spiny projection neurons that express the Drd1 dopamine receptor (D1-MSNs), which express ACE
at a higher level than other neurons. This mechanism of action has great therapeutic potential, as our preliminary
data indicate the decrease in excitatory drive to D1-MSNs can diminish the rewarding effects of fentanyl.
Previously published enzymatic assays using recombinant protein suggest that MERF is efficiently degraded by
the catalytic N-domain of ACE, though this has not been examined in brain tissue. This raises the exciting
possibility of a double-dissociation between catalytic domains of ACE that degrade angiotensin (C-domain) and
MERF (N-domain). The goal of this project is to independently evaluate the contribution of each ACE catalytic
domain to MERF degradation and endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens, in order to generate
new domain-specific ACE inhibitors with optimized properties for treatment of opioid use disorders. We will use
mice as an experimental system to separately manipulate each catalytic domain of ACE, through a combination
of complementary genetic and pharmacological manipulations. AIM 1 is to determine which catalytic domain
of ACE degrades MERF in nucleus accumbens tissue. We will directly quantify extracellular levels of MERF
using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and measure excitatory synaptic transmission using
whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from nucleus accumbens neurons. AIM 2 is to determine the behavioral
impact of domain-specific ACE inhibition on fentanyl CPP and self-administration. This will build on our
preliminary experiments using non-contingent fentanyl exposure (CPP), by incorporating parallel analysis of
intravenous fentanyl self-administration on an intermittent access schedule. AIM 3 is to optimize the central
activity and drug-like properties of domain-specific ACE inhibitors. We will perform systematic chemical
iterations involving (but not limited to) prodrug and drug delivery systems, with the goal of improving permeability
across the blood-brain barrier. These experiments should result in the identification and early optimization of
compounds that inhibit degradation of MERF by ACE in the brain. This novel mechanism could form the basis
of a viable new therapeutic strategy for treating opioid use disorders."
10985529,"This study seeks to address the challenge of how to deliver targeted interventions that address the
individualized cognitive needs of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients. The overall objective of our
predicate SBIR Phase I grant is to determine the feasibility of a timing intervention (PATH neurotraining) to
significantly improve visual working memory, processing speed (primary outcomes) and auditory working
memory, selective attention, cognitive flexibility, sustained attention, reading speed, and reading proficiency
(secondary outcomes) in mTBI patients more than after either Sham or conventional N-Back Working Memory
(WM) training (Aim 1). The present work is a critical step towards establishing feasibility of PATH training and
determining early stage data demonstrating efficacy and understanding individual differences regarding which
participants with mTBI may be the best targets for these types of timing interventions. Currently, there are no
proven solutions to remediate cognitive deficits prevalent in those with a mild TBI. We seek to remedy this in
the current study by conducting research to better understand perceptual and cognitive etiologies of mTBI and
how these may be differentially treated by cognitive training approaches that specifically target different core
components of cognitive control. We achieve our objectives by: 1) administering neuropsychological tests of
cognitive skills before and after 30 minutes of intervention training three times a week for 12 weeks, and 2) Use
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) brain imaging to test whether dorsal stream, attention, and memory networks
improve in function significantly more following PATH neurotraining than following N-Back WM training
(Exploratory Aim 2), and 3) Examine moderators that may determine training outcome (Aim 3). We will
determine if individual differences at initial assessment predict improvements following training for different
subpopulations: 1) Veterans vs. civilians, 2) different age groups, and 3) different loci and extent of the mTBI
deficit. We will determine whether timing-based deficits predict cognitive skill deficits, that are moderated by
individual factors. Studies with a MEG biomarker component, a neural correlate, will be used to determine the
pre-post timing and functional capabilities of different cortical areas in the visual, attention and executive
control pathways, in conjunction with behavioral pre-post standardized tests of cognitive abilities. This
exploratory aim will be used to determine whether different treatments should be explored during Phase II for
different types of mTBI and different ages. PATH neurotraining is designed from the ground up to incorporate
theory driven, empirically supported, approaches to vision training into an entertaining video game. The
challenge is to have PATH neurotraining be distributed by centers aimed at cognitive remediation for mTBI
patients, such as neurologists, rehab centers, and learning centers, which can only be done after this clinical
trial is completed. Moreover, we need to learn how to increase awareness of our clinical trials research so that
PATH neurotraining will be accepted as a proven method for remediating cognitive skills after a concussion."
10985588,"Project Summary (copied from Parent Grant)
Rural areas in the United States (U.S.) have exhibited higher mortality rates than urban areas since the late
1990s, a pattern known as the rural mortality penalty. Recent research has found that the rural mortality penalty
continues growing due to mortality associated with preventable causes (metabolic and cardiovascular causes,
alcohol use, and mental health). The expansion of Medicaid adopted by many states in the U.S. had the potential
to reduce death due to these and other causes by facilitating access to healthcare to people who were not eligible
under previous eligibility thresholds. While some state in the nation adopted this expansion, a process that
started in 2014, others rejected it. While the adoption/rejection of this expansion is well-documented, little is
known about the role the adoption of this policy at the state level impacted well-established demographic
phenomenon such as the rural mortality penalty. This project requests access to restricted data to produce
mortality rates for the population aged 19-64, by sex and by race/ethnicity to conduct a novel analysis of the
differences observed in the rural mortality penalty employing a difference-in-difference design. The project
evaluate whether the Medicaid expansion impacted the rural mortality penalty emphasizing the overall
population, and disparities by sex and race/ethnicity. The project will also be the first to explore whether the
COVID-19 pandemic impacted rural/urban mortality dynamics based on state-level adoption of the expansion of
Medicaid by 2020. The analytic approach will combine formal and mathematical demographic methods with
novel statistical models to evaluate the impact of the expansion of Medicaid in rural/urban mortality dynamics.
Findings from this project will illustrate the role that state-level policies have in shaping diverging or congruent
trajectories in mortality and in the face of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
10985597,"Project Summary: The operation of RNA polymerases (RNAPs) relies on numerous conformational changes.
During eukaryotic transcription, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) encountering oxidative lesions in its DNA template
often leads to misincorporation and transcriptional stalling. These events contribute to tumor growth in skin
cancer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes lethal tuberculosis and is responsible for over 1 million deaths
per year. Transcription initiation complexes of Mtb RNAP, especially the DNA loading gate, are effective targets
for the development of antibiotics. Revealing the dynamics of transcription initiation can thus provide novel
mechanistic insights into prokaryotic transcription and greatly facilitate the understanding of inhibition
mechanisms for antibiotics targeting Mtb RNAP. These two important biological problems in transcription drive
us to develop novel methodology using the generalized master equation (GME) to model biomolecular
conformational changes. My group has been successful in developing GME methods that explicitly consider the
memory functions of biomolecular dynamics and outperform the popular Markov State Model (MSM) method.
However, as an emerging approach, the current implementation of GME is prone to instability when estimating
memory functions for complex RNAP systems. We here propose novel methods to build GME models. Our
specific aims are: 1. To develop new GME methods to model conformational changes. Specifically, to derive a
new theory (IGME) to solve the GME, to develop efficient implementations of the GME to enhance numerical
stability when computing memory kernels from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, and to create a
protocol tailor-made for building GME models to study biomolecular conformational changes. Our preliminary
work shows that the proposed IGME method greatly outperforms the original implementation of GME in yielding
robust and accurate predictions of the biomolecular dynamics, especially for the complex RNAP system. 2. To
reveal how the dynamic coupling of several key conformational changes (i.e., the loading of NTP, the rotation of
the damaged DNA base, and the translocation of Pol II on the DNA template) leads to transcriptional
mutagenesis and/or stalling. Specifically, to construct GME models to elucidate molecular mechanisms of 8-oxo-
guanine (8OG) and Guanidinohydantoin (Gh) lesions induced ATP misincorporation and/or transcriptional
stalling. 3. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional initiation and its inhibition of Mtb RNAP.
Specifically, to construct GME models to reveal the dynamics of the Mtb RNAP’s loading gate without DNA, and
to further reveal the dynamics for the transition from a partially formed transcription bubble to a fully formed
bubble, a conformational change involving both Mtb RNAP’s gate opening and DNA unwinding. We further aim
to understand the recognition mechanisms of multiple antibiotic compounds, including Myxopyronin (Myx) and
Fidaxomicin (Fdx) that target the loading gate motion, and Sorangicin (Sor) that inhibits the formation of the full
transcription bubble. These mechanistic insights will facilitate the rational design of new inhibitors fighting drug
resistance of Mtb in the long term. Throughout our studies, we will work closely with our experimental
collaborators to conduct biochemical, time-resolved X-ray, and Cryo-EM experiments to test and validate our
predictions. Our innovative GME methods will provide a general computational framework to model functional
conformational changes of biomolecules. Our developed protocol and associated code development in the
MSMBuilder software will widely benefit the biophysics community."

More than 24,000 children develop acute respiratory failure (ARF) and require invasive mechanical ventilation
(MV) – an intrusive, painful, yet lifesaving procedure – in the US each year. There is a critical knowledge gap
regarding the optimal approach for analgosedation (analgesia-based sedation) in these children. As a result,
the current standard-of-care is to provide opioids for the duration of MV. Despite high-dose opioid exposure,
more than 90% of these children have suboptimal pain control. Studies show that repeated episodes of acute
pain and prolonged opioid exposure put children at risk for chronic pain, opioid tolerance, withdrawal, delirium,
and other negative effects. Yet, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) target optimizing acute pain
management in this high-risk population. In our study, Optimizing Pain Treatment In Children On
Mechanical ventilation (OPTICOM), the central hypothesis is that a protocolized strategy of administering
non-opioid adjuvant therapies to children with ARF will reduce pain and decrease opioid exposure. The primary
objective of OPTICOM is to define the effectiveness of supplementing opioids with acetaminophen and/or
ketorolac at decreasing episodes of acute pain in children with ARF on MV. This large-scale multi-site double-
blind placebo controlled RCT will enroll 644 children across 14 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and
randomize to one of 4 arms: Acetaminophen + Placebo; Ketorolac + Placebo; Acetaminophen + Ketorolac; or
Placebo + Placebo. We will systematically monitor all children for acute pain for the first 5 days of IMV and
quantify total opioid exposure in morphine milligram equivalents per kg as defined by the HEAL common data
elements. Effects of acetaminophen and ketorolac will be determined using a 2x2 factorial design. This
innovative proposal will leverage the extensive resources and experience of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical
Care Research Network (CPCCRN) at executing clinical trials in the complicated PICU environment to achieve
results within the 5-year study period. CPCCRN will ensure enrollment of a geographically, racially, and
socioeconomically diverse patient population to allow for wide generalizability of study findings. By expanding
HEAL-KIDS research into a unique and unstudied population, this project will lead to a paradigm shift in the
care provided to critically ill children. Consistent with the goals of the Acute Pain Clinical Trials Program, the
OPTICOM study will advance the treatment of acute pain in a diverse population of children across the age-
spectrum and advance our ultimate goal of developing comprehensive evidence-based clinical guidelines for
management of pain in children with ARF."

This application is a request for funds to support a conference titled the ‘Simian Collective’ (SimCo) that highlights
nonhuman primate neuroscience research in the United States and its unique role as a translational model of
human neurological, neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders and healthy and impaired aging. Our collective
and proposed conference seeks to build a crucial community effort to address the key challenges facing the field
of nonhuman primate neuroscience in the 21st Century. The conference is strategically organized to stress that
maximizing the impact of nonhuman primate neuroscience research in the modern era necessitates
complementary goals of Science, Ethics, Education and Advocacy. Owing to the shared functional organization
of the primate brain, our simian cousins are uniquely powerful models from which we can learn many facets of
human brain function in both health and disease. This cutting-edge research must continue to grow and receive
renewed investments to prosper. The meeting will also emphasize that the phylogenetic advantages of using a
primate model, which shares many unique neural and cognitive characteristics with humans, for investigative
research must also be balanced by the crucial neuroethical considerations that inevitably emerge because of
these similarities. Furthermore, the Simian Collective will also emphasize the responsibility of the members of
the field to educate our scientific colleagues and the public about the unique importance of nonhuman primate
research and to advocate for its significance. The program of the meeting emphasizes the complementary
relationship between these core tenets and seeks to build a community initiative to promote and ensure
nonhuman primate neuroscience research in the coming years. The past two conferences were extraordinarily
successful with ~200+ attendees across all levels - student, post-doctoral fellow, assistant, associate and full
professors. We anticipate our community to grow, attract new talent, and remain a vibrant contributor to
neuroscience research."

This proposal requests funds to be used to support travel and registration fees for postdoctoral fellows and
graduate students to attend the 48th International Herpesvirus Workshop (IHW) in Portland, Oregon. The IHW
is the major annual meeting for scientists studying all the herpesviruses and is very well established in its 48th
year. This meeting has been very successful, in part, because of the enthusiastic participation of the world's
leading herpesvirus researchers. The strength of the Workshop rests on the cross-fertilization that results from
comparison of different herpesviruses, different approaches to key questions and on the support and
participation of leading researchers in the field, most significantly including promising young investigators and
students in training. Moreover, the forum is truly international, with broad-based world-wide attendance. The
medical importance of this meeting is clearly indicated from the wide variety of diseases caused by the now-
recognized eight human herpesviruses. These include skin and eye ulcerations (HSV-1), genital lesions (HSV-
2), meningitis and encephalitis (HSV-1 and HSV-2), infectious mononucleosis (EBV), chicken pox and shingles
(VZV). CMV is a major cause of birth defects including mental retardation, blindness and deafness due to
congenital transmission but also a significant opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients and organ transplant
recipients. In addition, CMV has been implicated as a pathogenic contributor in the development of
atherosclerosis. Cancer has also been associated with herpesvirus infections. EBV is associated with Burkitt's
lymphoma, other B cell neoplasias and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The most recent human herpesvirus
discovered (HHV-8 or KSHV) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma in AIDS patients and other
immunosuppressed persons in other groups. All of the herpesviruses persist for life and therefore pose
significant problems in the treatment of immune-compromised individuals. Diseases caused by reactivation of
most human herpesviruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in various immune patient
populations. Workshop sessions will take an interdisciplinary approach to the following topics: virus structure,
mechanism of virus entry and cell-cell spread, membrane proteins, pathogenesis and latency, DNA replication,
vaccination and the immune response, transcriptional control, regulation of gene expression, chemotherapeutic
targets, and virus gene therapy."
10995701,"ABSTRACT
Asthma is one of the most common non-communicable illness among children in the United States. This disease
is comprised of multiple pathobiological subgroups, also known as endotypes, which have distinct pathologies
and differential responses to treatment. Clinical evidence has identified an endotype of asthma comprised of
individuals who are frequently (≥2 times per 12 months) hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. While there
have been previous studies examining the clinical characteristics of the frequent exacerbator (FE) endotype, the
heterogeneity of the populations studied makes findings difficult to generalize to pediatric populations.
Additionally, there have been no studies examining the underlying biological differences which may be
responsible for recurrent exacerbations. To answer these questions, we have leveraged the Ohio Pediatric
Asthma Repository (OPAR), the first statewide repository of patients admitted for an asthma exacerbation at any
of the 6 major pediatric medical centers. In addition to clinical and epidemiologic data, biosamples (nasal
epithelial cells, blood, etc) are stored in our laboratory at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, allowing us a unique
opportunity to explore the biologic underpinnings of the FE endotype. In our first study, we performed RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq) of upper airway epithelial cells and found: (a) FEs are a biologically distinct endotype of
pediatric asthma; (b) the transcriptome of FEs is characterized by an increase in expression of gene modules
enriched for nervous system processes; (c) non-FEs (nFEs) show an increase in gene modules enriched for
allergic immunity as has been described previously in asthma; and (d) increased expression of modules enriched
for nervous system processes in individuals with >2 annual exacerbations, regardless of whether it was the 2nd
or the 7th. We also have preliminary data showing differences in methylation patterns between FEs and nFEs
indicative of epigenetic changes coupled with our transcriptomic results. Together, our findings and existing
literature suggest a durable molecular shift in the airways which predisposes an individual for frequent asthma
exacerbations. Therefore, we hypothesize the unique transcriptional divergence exhibited in the airways
of FEs is a durable change characterized by cell-specific epigenetic and gene expression changes. We
propose to test this hypothesis by: (i) collecting samples from FEs during an exacerbation and a period of normal
lung function to assess gene expression durability (Aim 1), and (iii) generate single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-
seq datasets to determine cell-specific patterns of expression and gene regulatory networks associated with
frequent asthma exacerbations (Aim 2). Our studies will further define the molecular etiology of this important
pediatric asthma endotype and provide putative targets for therapeutic intervention."

 The mission of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is to protect the health and
wellness of the people of Illinois through the prevention, health promotion, regulation, and
control of disease and injury. The goal of the IDPH Illinois Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System (PRAMS) core surveillance project is to reduce infant morbidity and mortality
by improving maternal health through the collection of high-quality data used for research and
data-driven program and policy development that promotes systems changes and adoption of
healthful behaviors before pregnancy, prenatally, and after delivery.
 Illinois PRAMS provides the source of statewide epidemiologic surveillance data on the
health and experiences of women with recent live births. Illinois PRAMS collects survey data
following a standardized protocol that produces information on the behaviors and experiences of
women with a recent live birth that is not otherwise available. Illinois PRAMS randomly samples
women from vital records birth files and stratifies the sample to be representative of low
birthweight births. The specific aims are:
• To collect population-based data of high scientific quality on topics relating to pregnancy
 and early infancy;
• To conduct data analyses to increase understanding of maternal behaviors and
 experiences before and during pregnancy and early infancy and their relationship to
 health outcomes;
• To translate results from analyses into useable information for planning and evaluation
 of public health programs and policy; and
• To build state capacity for collecting, analyzing, and translating data to address relevant
 maternal and infant health issues.
 The goal and specific aims of the Illinois PRAMS project help IDPH fulfill its mission. IDPH

Early life adversity predisposes individuals to develop anxiety and mood disorders. More women
than men have these diagnoses, and times of hormonal change, including puberty, postpartum,
and menopause, are associated with increased risk of emotional dysfunction. Neuronal
oscillations in the anterior hippocampus of humans are associated with anxiety and memory
consolidation. In rodents, neuronal oscillations in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP), considered
analogous to the anterior hippocampus, have been linked to avoidance behavior and memory
function. The early life adversity paradigm of maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW)
alters vHIP neuronal oscillations and behavior in male mice. MSEW also increases expression of
vHIP perineuronal nets, extracellular matrix structures that surround inhibitory interneurons and
are known to restrict plasticity. Females show similar changes in vHIP function after MSEW, but
only in the diestrus stage of the estrous cycle, a time characterized by a relatively high ratio of
progesterone to estradiol. In the vHIP, progesterone is converted to the neurosteroid
allopregnanolone, which binds to inhibitory GABAA  subunit extrasynaptic receptors, and
increases tonic inhibition. During diestrus, MSEW females have higher progesterone to
allopregnanolone ratios in the vHIP than control-reared females and blocking progesterone
receptors restores MSEW behavior to control levels. The masking of MSEW effects during other
stages of the estrous cycle raises questions about protective mechanisms, with estradiol being a
potential candidate. The broad, long-term objectives of this proposal are to investigate potential
roles for progesterone, allopregnanolone, and estradiol in early life adversity effects on vHIP
neuronal oscillations and behavior in both sexes. More specifically, we will use RT-qPCR, in situ
hybridization, ELISA, and mass spectrometry to better understand the influence of MSEW on
vHIP gene expression and steroid content, as well as pharmacological and viral manipulations of
steroids and PNN components in wildtype and transgenic mice. These approaches will be used
to assess the underpinnings of MSEW-induced changes in vHIP function using high-resolution
confocal imaging of immunolabeled perineuronal nets and GABAA  subunit receptors, in vivo
electrophysiology, and behavioral analyses. Taken together, the findings of the proposed
experiments will advance our understanding of how steroid hormones and neurosteroids confer
vulnerability or protection after early life adversity in female and male mice."

Homelessness increased by 45% from 2020 to 2021, largely from economic hardship caused by the COVID-19
pandemic and has reached all-time highs across the US. More than 1.25 million people experience
homelessness in the US at some point in a year, with underserved racial and ethnic groups being
disproportionately affected. Denver and San Francisco are two cities in which homelessness is at crisis levels.
Homelessness increased by more than 30% since 2022 in Denver and San Francisco has the highest
prevalence of homelessness in the US. In both cities, Black individuals comprise between one-quarter and
one-third of the homeless population despite representing only 5% of the general population. Homelessness
can lead to and is associated with profound health effects. People who experience homelessness die on
average 30 years earlier than other Americans and have increased risk of substance use disorders and
incident HIV than people who are stably housed. It is critical that we develop feasible, effective, and cost-
effective tailored approaches to improve health and decrease racial disparities in life expectancy, overdose,
and HIV. Yet, while effective, evidence-based solutions that improve health outcomes exist, they are far from
ubiquitously implemented. Homelessness and the health issues among people experiencing it are
heterogeneous, driven by locale-specific factors. Thus, locale-specific solutions are needed urgently.
Simulation models can quickly fill knowledge gaps by serving as laboratories for testing hypotheses in real-
time. Models that simulate the housing continuum can be critical in augmenting randomized trials that provide
evidence on system innovations, projecting the impact on health and costs. Our goal is to provide an evidence
base for the prioritization and optimization of strategies and structural interventions to improve health of people
experiencing homelessness and decrease racial/ethnic health disparities in HIV, overdose, and life
expectancy. In Aim 1, we will employ a Group Model Building (GMB) approach to engage community
stakeholders in the scientific process and inform the development of agent-based models that simulate health
outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities along the housing and homelessness continuum of care. In Aim 2, we
will develop agent-based models simulating the dynamic processes contributing to overdoses, HIV, and life
expectancy among people along the housing continuum of care in Denver and San Francisco. In Aim 3, we will
simulate and compare HIV and substance use service delivery programs implemented along the housing
continuum versus housing-centered programs. We will assess changes in HIV and overdose rates among the
general population experiencing homelessness. We will also examine the potential of these programs to
reduce racial/ethnic disparities in these health outcomes. Through this proposal, we will develop a national
resource that generates the scientific knowledge needed to improve health among people experiencing
homelessness, reduce disparities, decrease overdose, and End the HIV Epidemic."

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can cause a wide range of neurocognitive, behavioral, and functional
impairments that persist throughout the lifespan. The collective impairments of PAE are known as fetal alcohol
spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD is an umbrella term which encompasses several diagnoses of different
degrees of severity. Despite the well-known teratogenic effects, recent estimates indicate that as many as 1 in
10 women consume alcohol during pregnancy. Thus, prenatal exposure to alcohol is a significant public health
concern. Furthermore, there is little research on the impact of the postnatal environment on developmental
outcomes in children with FASD. Factors in the postnatal environment may act as risk factors which contribute
to adverse outcomes or protective factors of resilience to promote positive outcomes in this population.
Children who have been prenatally exposed to alcohol may face unique early life challenges in the family
environment that may further impact cognitive and behavioral functioning. However, the family environment in
children with PAE is not well-understood. Children with PAE often experience unique family environments due
to seperation from their biological parents and are often raised in adoptive care or by other related family
members. Thus, many children with FASD experience high rates of adverse early life experiences and an
unstable home environment. It is unknown how these distinctive postnatal family factors impact developmental
trajectories in individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure. As such, these factors are important to further explore
to identify intervention targets and areas of support needed in families with children or adolescents with PAE.
To address this disparity, the proposed project seeks to: 1) Identify risk and protective factors of resilience at
the family level in children and adolescents with FASD; 2) Examine the impact of family risk and resilience
factors on cognitive, behavioral, and functional outcomes in children and adolescents with FASD; 3) Explore
perspectives on family risk and protective factors of resilience through the lived experiences of caregivers
across multiple family environments. To capture the diversity of family experiences in children with PAE, three
groups of caregivers will be explored: biological parents, adoptive or foster parents, and other related
caregivers. A mixed-methods approach using both qualitative interviews and additional quantitative measures
will be used in caregivers of children with prenatal alcohol exposure to provide novel information about the
lived experiences of families and to capture their perspectives on current barriers. Successful completion of
these Aims will provide direct clinical impact by critically informing family-focused interventions that promote
protective factors of resilience and target risk factors in the family environment to address this population's
unique needs and improve lifetime outcomes in individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure."
10995395,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human vision is initiated by photons of light hitting the retina, a light-sensitive tissue lining the inside of the eye.
At the center of the human retina is the fovea, a highly specialized region that supports high-acuity vision. The
fovea is distinguished by an excavation of the inner retinal layers with a concomitant lack of vasculature, an
increased packing of cone photoreceptors, a unique “private-line” circuitry between cones and midget ganglion
cells, and a near-absence of rod photoreceptors. Several conditions are known to affect the development of
these foveal specializations often resulting in reduced visual function (e.g., achromatopsia, albinism, blue cone
monochromacy, and premature birth). To provide the best care for individuals with these conditions whose visual
function is negatively affected, it is critically important to understand how variations in foveal morphology lead to
a reduction in visual function. Non-invasive clinical imaging tools such as optical coherence tomography (OCT)
and OCT angiography provide information about the overall structure of the retina and can be used to detect
significant structural changes due to disease or injury. Complementing these clinical tools is adaptive optics
scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). AOSLO is a non-invasive, in vivo imaging technique that corrects for
the eye’s monochromatic aberrations and can provide cellular-resolution imaging of the retina, including
resolution of the foveal cone mosaic. AOSLO can also be used to perform psychophysical studies to probe
structure-function relationships in the retina. Here, we will use a combination of clinical modalities like OCT along
with AOSLO to investigate several developmental specializations of the human fovea in vivo including foveal
cone packing and the development of regions which are free of short-wavelength-sensitive cones (S-cones) or
rods at the central fovea. Our central hypothesis is that the coordinated development of foveal specializations is
disrupted in cases of foveal disease. We will investigate this hypothesis through the work of the following two
specific aims: Aim 1) Assess foveal cone topography and function in individuals with a history of premature birth;
Aim 2) Examine the relationship of the S-cone sub-mosaic and the rod mosaic. Completion of the proposed
research will provide key information about the variability of human foveal specializations in both health and
disease. Aim 1 will reveal the organization of the foveal cone mosaic in premature birth, which will help inform
the treatment of individuals with a history of premature birth who experience visual dysfunction. Aim 2 will serve
as a crucial step towards developing a map of how the interleaving of the photoreceptor mosaics near the fovea
affects humans’ high-acuity central vision. This work will also provide several training opportunities through the
use of psychophysical testing, application of optics and engineering principles used in non-invasive imaging, and
several clinical experiences beyond the laboratory. The training plan put forth in this proposal will enable and
support my development as an independent, translational scientist through a blend of basic vision science and
clinical application of our scientific findings."
10984095,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sepsis is a complex, heterogeneous, global inflammatory response to an infection that precipitates critical
hypotension, is beset with high mortality, and constitutes a clinical emergency. Large blood vessels
(macrovessels) become atonic and fluid-permeable, while small vessels (microvascular beds) do not perfuse,
causing shock and hypoxic organ damage, a condition termed vasoplegia. Dr. Wise endeavors to become an
independently funded, collaborative surgeon-scientist by characterizing physiologic injury and defining cellular
processes that occur during the vasoplegia precipitated by sepsis. While elimination of the infectious pathogen
is most critical to survival, mitigating vasoplegic physiology prevents morbidity to vital end organs such as the
lung. Examining the problem of vasoplegia from the lens of the vascular system necessarily requires career
development in three key areas, identified to optimally address the research question: cell biology and multi-
omics, use of intravital surveillance techniques (microscopy), and facility with large animal models to best
recapitulate human physiology in sepsis. This project is well-positioned to succeed due to a complementary
mentorship and advisory team led by Dr. Greg Beilman (University of Minnesota), strong institutional support,
and a focused career development plan inclusive of germane coursework, didactics, seminars and meetings.
Vasoplegia will be studied using a newly-piloted porcine “fecal clot” (with ischemia-reperfusion injury)
model of surgically-induced sepsis. In the first Aim, fecal clot sepsis or “sham” sepsis will be induced, followed
by surgical harvest of mesenteric and saphenous arteries and veins after 24 hours. Cut rings from these
vessels will be suspended in a muscle bath to determine relative severity of injury of smooth muscle cells,
endothelial cells and extracellular matrix. Permeability will be assessed via immunohistochemical staining for
glycocalyx. Regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and P38 MAP Kinase activation by
putative endogenous inhibitor Niban will be studied, to assess the role of “off-signaling” in propagating septic
inflammation. In the second Aim, lung microvasculature will be imaged using intravital orthogonal polarized
spectral video-microscopy, to quantify the loss of perfused vessels and blood flow induced by fecal clot sepsis.
After synthesis of macrovascular and microvascular injury patterns of vasoplegia from the first two Aims, a pilot
mitigation strategy will be tested in the third Aim. Intravenous “NiPp,” a rationally designed cell-permeant
phospho-mimetic of Niban developed in the laboratory of Colleen Brophy (co-mentor), will be administered to
septic pigs, to decrease harmful “feed-forward” activation of injury-induced pro-inflammatory pathways leading
to vasoplegia. The primary outcome will be improvement in a validated clinical porcine sepsis score. All pigs
will have systemic vascular tissue extensively bio-banked upon euthanasia. The robust animal model, data to
be collected, and the learned research techniques will collectively predicate a dynamic research program, with
potential for translating our findings to ultimately improve survival from sepsis, a major unmet clinical need."
10984098,"We will conduct a hybrid type 1 study to evaluate efficacy and preliminary implementation considerations for a novel intervention to promote uptake of drug checking services (DCS) and safer drug use behaviors among people who use drugs (PWUD) to reduce incidence of overdose (OD) in San Diego County. Along with ~50 other syringe services programs (SSPs) in the US, a local SSP recently began CheckSD, a DCS using test strips (TS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) that allows people to submit drug samples with non-nominal identifiers and obtain personalized results. While CheckSD and most existing DCS with FTIR offer some counseling about DCS results, no theory-based interventions to increase DCS uptake and promote post-DCS adoption of safer drug use behaviors have been rigorously evaluated. We drew from the Social Ecological Model and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) to develop and pilot MI-CHANCE (Motivational Interviewing for Community-based Harm reduction And drug-Checking Empowerment), a brief, bilingual, peer-led MI intervention. We culturally-tailored MI-CHANCE because Latinx PWUD are less likely to access harm reduction services, contributing to racial/ethnic disparities in OD rates. Our Aims are: Aim 1. To test the efficacy of MI-CHANCE on rates of combined fatal and non-fatal OD over 30 months and examine SCT-informed mediators
and moderators of intervention effects (i.e., knowledge, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy). Aim 2. To conduct an inward-looking implementation evaluation to examine MI-CHANCE acceptability, feasibility and experiences among i) trial participants and ii) SSP staff in San Diego County; iii) collect data on implementation costs of MI-CHANCE and CheckSD to inform adoption by SSPs and policy-makers. Aim 3. To conduct an outward-looking exploration of MI-CHANCE's scalability among SSP staff at 20 other U.S. locations, purposively sampled to represent nascent and established DCS. To meet Aim 1, we will recruit 588 PWUD who have not yet used CheckSD into a two-arm RCT (N=294 per group). Both arms will have access to CheckSD's standard of care (SOC) already available at SSP sites (i.e., FTIR, and overdose education and naloxone distribution). PWUD randomized to receive MI-CHANCE will receive it from peer counselors trained in MI to encourage CheckSD uptake and safer drug use behaviors. Those in the attention-control SOC arm will receive COVID-19 education. All will undergo semi-annual follow-up for 30 months. Aims 2-3 will be guided by the revised RE-AIM/PRISM implementation science framework. This will be the first trial to rigorously evaluate efficacy and preliminary implementation of an intervention to optimize DCS uptake and behavioral outcomes
for reducing OD. Despite the high promise of DCS, it is an innovation for which real world implementation is ahead of—but could be strengthened by—empirical research on behavioral intervention and implementation supports. If MI-CHANCE is efficacious, it could be rapidly deployed at harm reduction programs across the country to reduce OD deaths and disparities due to changes in the drug supply.

10992822,"Project Summary
Many cancers are attributed to chronic inflammation, which can cause mutations and activate oncogenic signaling
pathways. An important example is gastric cancer, the fourth-leading cause of cancer death worldwide. At least 80%
of gastric cancer cases are attributed to stomach infection with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (Hp), which causes
lifelong chronic inflammation that does not eradicate the infection. In some individuals, this inflammation can cause
gastric atrophy, metaplasia (conversion of one normal cell type to another), dysplasia (presence of abnormal
cells) and finally cancer, but the specific mechanism(s) through which Hp triggers this cascade are not well
understood. Similar preneoplastic changes are recapitulated in a mouse model through tamoxifen-induced
expression of active KRAS in the chief cells of the stomach (KRAS+ mice). I found that Hp infection of KRAS+ mice
exacerbated disease: compared to Hp-KRAS+ mice, Hp+KRAS+ mice had an altered trajectory of metaplasia and
accelerated dysplasia. Hp+KRAS+ mice also had expansion of “variant” pit cells (surface mucous cells) that
expressed metaplasia- and cancer-related genes like the mucin Muc4. In accordance with the hypothesis that Hp
causes cancer through eliciting chronic inflammation, Hp+KRAS+ mice had severe inflammation marked by a ten-
fold increase in T cells vs. Hp-KRAS+ mice. In this proposal I will investigate the mechanism(s) through which Hp
worsens disease in KRAS+ mice, with a broader goal of better understanding how Hp infection and its associated
chronic inflammation cause cancer. I hypothesize that Hp modulates the inflammatory response to prevent Hp
eradication from the stomach, and this deleterious immune response leads to metaplasia and dysplasia. In Aim 1 I
will perform targeted depletion of CD4+ and CD8α+ T cell subsets to assess whether immune perturbation impacts
metaplasia, dysplasia and Hp colonization. I will also assess whether T cells traffic to the stomach in Hp+KRAS+
mice or proliferate locally. Finally, I will test whether Hp+ human samples have increased T cells relative to Hp-
samples. In Aim 2 I will investigate candidate Hp virulence factors that modulate inflammation: the cag type IV
secretion system and two proteins that modulate T cells, the toxin VacA and the transpeptidase gGT. I will determine
whether virulence factor mutants can elicit the same inflammatory and disease progression phenotypes in KRAS+
mice as wild-type Hp does. In Aim 3 I will test whether variant pit cells arise from gastric progenitor cells, and will
assess disease phenotypes in Hp+KRAS+MUC4- mice to determine whether Muc4 expression drives pit cell
transformation. I will also perform spatial single-cell RNA sequencing in +/- Hp, +/- KRAS mice to discover whether
variant pit cells share a gene expression signature with Muc4-expressing cells in the “first gland” of the stomach, a
morphologically distinct gland that is believed to be a source of reparative cell lineages. Taken together, the results
of these studies will provide new understanding of how Hp infection and inflammation cause gastric preneoplastic
progression and may reveal new targets for gastric immunotherapy. These findings may also be applicable to other
cancers associated with bacterial infection and/or inflammation, like colorectal cancer."
10980919,"The visual pathways of the human fetal brain are highly active before birth. During this pre-visual period
spontaneous activity in the retina provides the primary input to visual brain and data from neonatal rodents
implicate this early activity in normal development and organization of visual pathways. While we understand
much about the specialized circuits that produce activity in the developing retina, and the consequences of
disruption of that activity for eye and brain outcomes, we know little of the brain activity that supports the
earliest stages of sensory development. Early retinal activity is not passively transmitted in the developing
brain. Rather, it is actively amplified and transformed by mechanisms unique to this developmental stage.
This proposal will use a rodent model of human fetal brain development to follow the propagation and
transformation of early retinal activity at each stage of the primary visual pathway in thalamus and visual
cortex, to understand the mechanisms of its transformation, the role of individual thalamic regions, and the
ultimate impact of this circuit on functional visual maps and responsiveness. This knowledge is important
because disruption of early retinal, thalamic, or cortical activity associated with preterm birth or hypoxic birth
complications can cause lasting visual impairment. Any treatment or early diagnosis (such as using EEG)
requires knowledge of the normal developmental circuitry, activity and function of thalamus and cortex, which
this project will provide."
10980798,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While immunotherapies have proved compelling efficacy against other leukemias, their application for acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) is still hampered by the absence of tumor-restricted targets. The most suitable AML
targets are shared with healthy hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) or mature myeloid cells, leading to
on-target/off-tumor toxicity and impairment of hematopoietic reconstitution. To address this issue, we
hypothesized that epitope-engineering of donor HSPCs used for conventional bone marrow transplantation can
endow hematopoietic lineages with selective resistance to CAR-T or monoclonal antibodies (mAb), without
affecting protein function or regulation. This strategy allows targeting genes essential for leukemia survival
regardless of shared expression on HSPCs, thus reducing the risk of tumor immune escape by antigen
downregulation/loss. We have already identified single amino-acid (aa) changes that abrogate the binding of
therapeutic mAb targeting FLT3, CD123, and KIT and optimized a base-editing approach to introduce them into
CD34+ HSPCs, which retain long-term engraftment and multilineage differentiation capacity. We confirmed the
in vivo resistance of epitope-edited hematopoiesis to CAR-T treatment and the concomitant eradication of
patient-derived AML xenografts (Casirati et al., Nature 2023). Here, we will capitalize on these achievements
and exploit state-of-the-art genetic engineering tools and in vivo modeling with the objectives to i) generate and
functionally validate “stealth” FLT3, KIT, and IL3RA genes by multiplex base-editing; ii) identify the best-
performing CAR configuration for multi-Ag targeting on AML samples and iii) validate resistance of edited HSPC
to new immunotherapies directed against these targets. This project will provide fundamental advancement of
new and more effective immunotherapy approaches for AML that should additionally have broad applicability to
several other hematopoietic malignancies."
10981593,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The role of inflammation in alcohol-associated liver disease has been thoroughly researched over the past few
decades. Despite this intensive focus on ALD pathophysiology, we have yet to realize meaningful
improvements to therapeutic design in humans. Our laboratory has established that macrophage migration
inhibitory factor (MIF) is a dynamic and multifaceted contributor to ALD. Furthermore, as our data will show,
specific depots of MIF, like hepatocytes and myeloid cells, contribute to ALD pathophysiology through distinct
mechanisms. The crosstalk between MIF and its cognate receptor, CD74, within the resident liver populations
and infiltrating cells from the periphery in ALD is not yet known. The overall goal for this proposal is to define
the contributions of MIF-CD74 signaling in ALD. Our preliminary data show that although hepatocyte- and
myeloid-derived Mif deficiency protected from ethanol-mediated steatosis, inflammation and cell death in the
liver, the hepatic transcriptomic program was divergent in these models despite equivalent protection from
injury. Interestingly, expression of Mif is robust in the hepatocyte compartment, but Cd74 is largely confined to
the monocytes/macrophages in a quiescent liver, but its expression is increased by ethanol, possibly due to
immune cell accumulation or upregulation of expression in hepatocytes. This suggests that the role of Cd74 in
ethanol feeding and ALD might be augmented throughout the progression of the disease and we will target
expression of Cd74 by multiple means in models of ethanol feeding. Moreover, the role of MIF in fibrosis
remains controversial, with several publications describing both protective and deleterious roles of MIF-CD74
signaling, but were limited to use of global knockouts. Our unique animal models and experience in ethanol
feeding will allow us to scrutinize the Mif-Cd74 pathway in multiple cellular depots in models of fibrosis. The
proposed research plan over the funding period will be divided into three specific aims that will 1) define and
characterize the role of Cd74 expression in hepatocytes and myeloid compartments during and after ethanol
feeding models in mice, 2) resolve the controversy of the role of MIF-CD74 pathway in hepatic fibrosis, and 3)
therapeutic targeting of hepatic MIF and CD74 via anti-sense oligonucleotide technology. These proposed
areas will have profound implications in innate immune responses in ALD, and will support scrutinizing the
distinctive, tissue-specific expression of mediators of tissue injury in chronic diseases of the liver."
10981595,"Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a poorly understood disorder characterized by excessive daytime
sleepiness despite normal nighttime sleep, often accompanied by difficulty awakening,
unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment. Once thought to be present in <1% of the
population, recent work indicates a far greater prevalence, with underdiagnosis exacerbated by
a limited understanding of this disorder. IH patients commonly report poor management of
symptoms and impaired quality of life, and treatments are not based on disease etiology. Twin
studies show that daytime sleepiness is between 37-48% heritable and family history of
excessive sleepiness, IH, or other hypersomnia disorders is present in ~1/3 of IH patients.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of hypersomnia traits have identified 24 genome-
wide significant SNPs specifically associated with increased sleep propensity. Here, we propose
a comprehensive approach to identify effector genes for hypersomnia-related traits, using
“variant to gene mapping to in vivo validation” that will intersect GWAS data with ATAC-seq and
high-resolution promoter- focused Capture C neuronal datasets derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to identify potential effector genes. We will rapidly validate
identified candidates in an established Drosophila model of sleep and extend findings into
zebrafish to test for behavioral relevance in a vertebrate system. Using approaches described in
this proposal, we have already strongly implicated a gene, vertebrate CADM2, as associated
with hypersomnia-like phenotypes across species with loss of function. In Aim 1, we will use a
comprehensive combination of TAD-wise analysis of genome wide significant sleep propensity
loci and “3D Genomics” approaches in key cell types to implicate additional candidate effector
genes harbored in the sub-threshold P-value zones of the existing GWAS datasets. In Aim 2,
we will use Drosophila to determine the mechanism through which loss of CADM2 (functional
homolog in fly, beat-Ia) affects the function of key arousal circuits in the brain. In parallel, we will
screen identified candidate genes for relevance to excessive sleepiness in vivo in flies using an
RNAi-based approach. In Aim 3, we will rigorously examine sleep phenotypes in Cadm2b
knockout zebrafish and prioritize other candidate genes for vertebrate using a rapid CRISPR
approach pipeline. This project will identify novel genetic variants and the corresponding effector
genes that contribute to hypersomnia-related traits, thereby shedding light on the biological
pathways that influence the development of the traits. Study results will have fundamental
implications for novel approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of IH."
10981817,"Sleep and physical activity/sedentary behavior are physiological and behavioral processes that are intricately
intertwined. Their Interconnectedness is particularly pronounced during early infancy when these systems are
rapidly developing in concert with neurobiological changes. Yet, sleep and physical activity/sedentary behavior
are often studied in isolation and with little attention to the home environment in which they occur. Further, current
state-of-the-art methods, including wearables and mobile sensing devices that automate assessment of sleep,
physical activity, and sedentary behavior, have been developed and validated predominantly with adults,
adolescents, and school-age children. These adult-based methods, however, do not translate to infant
populations and the unique challenges posed by this development period. With these issues in mind, our
overarching aim is to advance methodological tools that provide valid, automated, objective, and fine-grained
assessments of infant health behaviors in real-world environments. In doing so, we will use LittleBeats, an infant
multimodal wearable device engineered by our team, that integrates a microphone to collect audio data, a 3-
lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess infant cardiac physiology, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU)
sensor to assess infant motion and posture. LittleBeats can be worn by infants for extended periods of time (8-
10 hours) in their natural environments without researchers present. We will leverage high-density data from this
infant wearable to address three specific aims. First, we will develop and validate multimodal deep learning (DL)
algorithms that use audio, ECG, and motion data as input to detect infant sleep/wake states, including quiet
sleep, active sleep, drowsy, quiet alert, active alert, and crying states. Second, we will develop and validate DL
algorithms that use ECG and motion data as input to detect infant physical activity (i.e., tummy time) and
sedentary time (e.g., time restrained in a car seat). Third, because environmental noise, including loudness,
variability, and number of sound sources have been associated with negative physiological, behavioral, and
cognitive outcomes during the first year of life, we will leverage audio data from the LittleBeats device worn by
the infant to detect noises in the home environment. Our development and validation will occur across two
samples of infants under six months of age. DL algorithms will be validated against (a) annotations by trained
and certified human coders, (b) ecological momentary assessments provided by infants’ primary caregivers, and
(c) polysomnography, the gold-standard for sleep. By bringing together assessments of infant sleep, physical
activity, sedentary behavior, and household noise under a single platform, we aim to advance research capacity
to investigate the interdependencies and transactions among these core infant health behaviors and the
environments in which they occur. Ultimately, such tools may aid in early detection, monitoring, and intervention
among infants at risk for sleep disturbances, obesity, and other poor health outcomes."
10981991,"Project Summary/Abstract
Binge alcohol drinking is a major risk factor for many diseases, including alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other
neuropsychiatric diseases, and women are at greater risk for developing AUD than men with the same history
of alcohol use. The sex hormone estrogen, which fluctuates across the menstrual/estrous cycle in females, has
been implicated in playing a regulatory role in alcohol drinking behavior across mammalian species, but the
specific mechanisms underlying this function are not well understood. We recently found that ovarian estrogen
acts via rapid, nongenomic signaling at membrane-associated estrogen receptors in the limbic system to drive
binge alcohol drinking behavior in gonadally intact female mice. We hypothesize that estrogen regulates
presynaptic neurotransmitter release and postsynaptic excitability in a coordinated fashion to regulate the
activation and signaling of critical neuropeptidergic circuits that promote alcohol use. In the proposed work, we
examine the circuit and receptor signaling context for rapid E2 modulation of neuronal function that drives
binge alcohol drinking in intact female mice. These studies will improve our understanding of this behavior in
females, potentially providing new avenues for pharmacotherapeutic approaches to curbing excessive alcohol
consumption."
10981684,"Summary
Chemical neurotransmission forms the basis for most neurotransmission and involves the
release of neurotransmitter from a presynaptic neuron, the detection of the transmitter on
receptors located on both post and presynaptic neurons, and the ‘uptake’ of the transmitter
by neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs), thus quenching the neurotransmitter
signal. NSSs are sodium-coupled membrane transport proteins that harness the pre-
existing ion gradient to ‘pump’ neurotransmitters into cells and ‘up’ their concentration
gradient. The removal of transmitter from the synaptic cleft and surrounding extracellular
spaces is crucial to neurotransmission and dysfunction of NSSs underpins multiple
neurological conditions. Moreover, there are many important therapeutic agents, as well as
illicit substances, that target NSSs, including antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications,
and amphetamines and cocaine. The goals of the research described in this grant
application are to further our understanding of the biochemical mechanism of NSS
function, to better understand how small molecule therapeutic agents and illicit substances
interact with NSSs, and to provide structure-based understanding of the consequences of
selected naturally occurring mutations in NSS genes. The major focus of the research is
to study the human serotonin and dopamine transporters using single particle cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) in combination with complementary biochemical,
biophysical and computational methods. We are particularly interested in understanding,
at the level of molecular detail, how newly discovered small molecules inhibit NSSs via
binding to a novel binding site and how these small molecules block isomerization of the
transporter to the inward facing conformations required to release transmitter. Moreover,
we will elucidate the underpinning molecular interactions between key small molecules and
the dopamine transporter to understand the principles of affinity and specificity, and we will
also examine how posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, affect
transporter conformation. The results from our studies will unveil new small molecule
binding sites and cognate small molecules, illuminate structural underpinnings of
phosphorylation, and explore the conformational landscape of NSSs in distinct, ligand and
ion bound states. Our studies will not only inform the immediate NSS field, but because
NSSs are paradigm integral membrane transporter proteins, our studies will enlighten the
larger field of membrane transport."
10981682,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Acromioclavicular joint (ACJ) injuries are one of the most prevalent shoulder injuries among young athletes
participating in contact sports, which could have long-term impacts on shoulder health and function. ACJ
reconstruction surgery is generally recommended for patients with high-grade injuries. Currently, there is limited
evidence supporting the selection of the optimal surgical technique for these patients. Surgical techniques in this
context can be categorized as rigid and non-rigid fixations. Rigid fixations are falling out of favor with sports
medicine doctors due to their inferior outcomes. Therefore, modern ACJ surgical repairs primarily focus on non-
rigid fixations, which can mimic the native anatomy and function of the disrupted joint better. Within non-rigid
anatomical fixation, two sub-categories can be identified. The first, more conventional sub-category is to
reconstruct only the vertical stabilizers of the ACJ (i.e., coracoclavicular ligaments). Lately, reconstructing the
ACJ capsule and the AC ligaments has received increased attention due to their distinct role in the horizontal
stability of ACJ, which is critical to surgical success and better patient outcomes. So, the second sub-category
emerged that combines acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular reconstruction to stabilize the joint more
completely. However, the benefits of this more complex procedure on shoulder mechanics and soft-tissue health
have yet to be determined (Gap 1). Also, within the combined technique, controversy exists on whether to
perform these repairs using suture techniques with bone tunnels (known to increase clavicle/coracoid fracture
risk) or to employ tunnel-free techniques that reduce the complication risks but may be less effective in restoring
shoulder stability and range of motion (Gap 2).
We address these gaps by a multi-center longitudinal study and test three groups of ACJ reconstructed
patients receiving one of the following surgeries: 1) coracoclavicular reconstruction alone with bone tunnels, 2)
combined coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular reconstruction with, and 3) without bone tunnels. We will use
advanced Dynamic Stereo X-ray and cutting-edge Ultrashort Echo Time Magnetic Resonance Imaging to
compare shoulder mechanics and soft-tissue health between cohorts over time. Our central hypothesis is that
shoulder mechanics and soft-tissue health are better restored with the combined acromioclavicular and
coracoclavicular reconstruction. Also, a less invasive tunnel-free combined reconstruction technique provides
similar outcomes to that with bone tunnels. This research contributes significantly to the following areas: 1) the
effectiveness of critical surgical decisions to reconstruct ACJ will be rigorously examined on shoulder mechanics
and soft tissue health over time to identify the gold-standard treatment. Specifically, we will corroborate: a)
whether to concurrently reconstruct acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular structures and b) whether to use the
tunnel-free instead of bone tunnel technique. 2) to identify shortcomings that can be addressed with future
developments, which can vertically advance the treatment of this frequent, potentially debilitating injury."
10981681,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a nationally representative longitudinal study
that focuses on the links between social, cognitive, mental, and physical health trajectories among older adults
in the U.S. Beginning in 2005–06, with respondents ages 57 to 85, NSHAP has collected four rounds of data at
5-year intervals and included detailed information on: social well-being, including social relationships, social
networks and social support; cognitive function, including Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related
dementias (AD/ADRD); mental health; physical performance; clinical diagnoses of cognitive and physical
disease; biological samples; medications; sensory function; and accelerometer-measured daily activity and
sleep. Additional data were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic on respondents’ health and experiences.
 The proposed NSHAP Round 5 (R5) will provide a fifth wave of data for Cohort 1 (born 1920-1947), a third
wave for Cohort 2 (born 1948-1965), and a first wave for a newly recruited Cohort 3 (born 1966-1980). Together,
the three cohorts will include adults aged 47 to 107. The experiences of people born after 1965 have differed
dramatically from those born earlier and R5 will allow researchers to examine how the complex interplay of social
and historical factors affects health trajectories as people age.
 In addition to the newly recruited Cohort 3, this study proposes to restructure the NSHAP sample to enhance
the power of ethnoracial comparisons both in the new cohort and in the older cohorts by augmenting the greatly
diminished surviving samples of Black and Hispanic respondents among Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 and recruiting
equal numbers of Black, Hispanic, and White plus Other adults in Cohort 3.
 R5 will include repeat and new measures to permit cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. Survey
measures new to R5 will include questions about ethnoracial identity, discrimination over the lifespan,
immigration experiences, language use, and social media use. We will also collect objective measures of health
for cognition and AD/ADRD, sensory and physical functioning, wrist accelerometry, and anthropometrics. For the
first time in NSHAP, we will include dominant grip strength, an objective online hearing test, leukocyte
differentiation, Cystatin C for kidney function, and AD/ADRD plasma biomarkers.
 Data collected will permit examination of the social determinants of health disparities within and between
ethnoracial groups, cohorts, and dyads. R5 will also provide the metrics to identify respondents with high mortality
risk, which will enable us to prepare for a targeted, inter-round, follow-up study, to be proposed separately.
 R5 data will be archived and made publicly available at NACDA at the University of Michigan. NSHAP’s
unparalleled combination of detailed social and biological measures make it uniquely suited to inform and support
the work of medical practitioners and health policymakers."
10981302,"Project Summary
Liver fluke infection with Opisthorchis viverrini remains problematic in East Asia and is endemic in Thailand and
Laos, where ~10 million people are infected. The public health implications of this situation are substantial since
there is no stronger link between a human malignancy and a eukaryotic pathogen than that between
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA, bile duct cancer) and infection with O. viverrini. Northeast Thailand reports the
highest incidence of CCA worldwide, with the 2014 CCA age standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 85 per
100,000, which equates to 26,000 CCA-related deaths annually. The contrast with countries without liver flukes
is stark given that incidence of CCA is less than 3 per 100,000 elsewhere (USA, 1.67 ASR, 2014).
 To survive in the biliary tract, the liver fluke actively releases excretory/secretory (ES) proteins and
extracellular vesicles (EVs) that facilitate fluke feeding and manipulation of the host immune response, and
ultimately modify cellular homeostasis that contributes to malignant transformation. Our hypothesis is that
targeting proteins that are essential for several discrete facets of parasitism and/or are known carcinogens via a
multi-valent vaccine will deliver a novel anti-infection/ anti-cancer therapy. We will address this hypothesis
through the following aims: Aim 1. Explore the importance of key fluke ES proteins in host-parasite
communication and leverage the findings to prioritize their selection as vaccine antigens. Aim 2. Determine
whether mRNA and/or protein subunit vaccines induce antibodies that reduce both fluke burdens and CCA
incidence in the hamster infection-cancer model. This proposal targets liver fluke ES proteins which drive the
phenotypic hallmarks of cancer in the biliary epithelium: 1) the granulin-like growth factor, Ov-GRN-1, known to
induce rampant cholangiocyte proliferation; 2) the tetraspanin, Ov-TSP-2, a key element of EVs and host-cell
communication; 3) the Ov-catF cysteine protease, a key component of the protein digestion cascade; and 4) the
Ov-M60mucinase which degrades host defensive mucus in the bile ducts.
 The conceptual innovation we utilize is a rodent model of human carcinogenesis where liver fluke
infection is a known risk factor. Technical innovations include gene knockout in the liver fluke, targeting key
pathogenic and nutritional processes, and combining the findings to develop vaccination against fluke infection
and the infection-induced cancer. These studies will determine whether fluke proteins that communicate at the
host-parasite interface represent the Achilles’ heel of this carcinogenic parasite. Targeting fluke-host
communication in combination with nutrient acquisition pathways may ultimately combat liver fluke-induced bile
duct cancer in the form of an anti-fluke, and indeed anti-cancer vaccine, a public health development with the
potential to benefit millions of (often impoverished) residents of endemic regions in East Asia."
10981365,"Osteoporosis, a disease of reduced bone density that leads to bone fragility, is a major clinical problem and is
primarily a disease of remodeling imbalance in which bone resorption outstrips formation. Although much progress
has been made in defining the key genes and molecular pathways regulating osteoblast (OBL) and osteoclast
(OCL) function and identifying targets for anti-resorptive and bone anabolic therapeutics, few studies have
examined bone extracellular matrix (ECM) formation by OBL and subsequent resorption by OCL dynamically in
live cells or living animals. Although the ECM was viewed as a static 3D scaffold, recent molecular imaging studies
in OBL and other living systems have revealed the highly dynamic nature of ECM assembly and our work has
shown that collagen fibril networks continually undergo movement, deformation and reorganization mediated by
cell and tissue-generated mechanical forces. Studies with cells from mice with GFP-tagged type I collagen and a
late OBL/osteocyte-targeted tdTomato reporter have enabled real-time imaging of collagen dynamics and
OBL/osteocyte fate. This has revealed novel osteocyte differentiation/embedding mechanisms, including collagen
trapping, cell movement into an already formed “collagen lacuna” or cells switching on osteocyte gene expression
within an already formed lacuna. Recent intravital imaging has revealed the complexity of OCL cell dynamics and
their responses to stimulators and inhibitors of bone resorption. This work suggests that RANKL induces OCL
fission and recycling and that the RANKL inhibitor, OPG-Fc, causes accumulation of fissioned cells that may be
re-activated upon withdrawal of RANKL inhibition. Based on these findings, the proposed studies center around
two hypotheses. The first is that osteogenic cellular and differentiation dynamics are integrated with and dependent
on collagen assembly, reorganization and mineralization dynamics and the second is that osteoclasts are highly
dynamic cells that transition between different active states and their resorptive dynamics/activation states are
differentially altered by agents that promote or inhibit bone resorption. Aim 1 will use mice expressing GFP-collagen
and osteogenic lineage reporters for in vitro and intravital imaging to determine how osteogenic cellular dynamics,
differentiation and cell fate are integrated with collagen assembly/mineralization dynamics and how these dynamics
are altered by osteogenic factors. Aim 2 uses similar approaches to define the dynamics of OCL bone resorption,
the dynamic interactions of OCL with osteocytes, their fate after bone resorption and how these are altered by
agents that stimulate and inhibit bone resorption. 3D multiplexed imaging will be done on imaged bones to spatially
map scRNAseq gene profiles at single cell resolution and correlate gene expression with cell dynamic histories to
identify pathways driving osteogenic/osteocyte differentiation and OCL recruitment and activation. Successful
completion of the aims may shift paradigms about the dynamic mechanisms of bone ECM assembly and resorption
and the interplay between bone cell and ECM dynamics and will have important implications for our understanding
of normal bone physiology and bone diseases, such as osteoporosis."
10981371,"SUMMARY
 Orphan diseases are individually rare but collectively affect a significant fraction of the population.
Such conditions are often misdiagnosed and lacking in effective therapies, leading to suffering and reduced
quality of life. Pachyonychia congenita (PC) is a rare skin disease that entails severe nail dystrophy, oral
leukoplakia, sebaceous gland defects and, most significantly, highly painful palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK).
PC is caused by mutations in any one of five keratin genes (KRT6A-C, KRT16, and KRT17) that encode
intermediate filament-forming proteins. These keratin genes are expressed in all ectoderm-derived epithelial
appendages and in palmoplantar skin, accounting for the tissues mainly affected in PC. In addition, the “PC
genes” (including the mutated alleles) are robustly induced upon stress of various etiologies (e.g., wounding,
infection, pressure stress), altering the balance between keratin proteins in diseased keratinocytes and likely
contributing to the complex phenotypes of PC. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of PC will not
only lead to better therapies for this condition but also deepen our knowledge of basic skin homeostasis, in
ways that may impact the clinical management of addtional skin disorders with features related to PC.
 The lack of genetically-relevant transgenic mouse models represents a crippling limitation in the study
of PC and the development and testing of novel therapies for this disorder. The major goal of this two-year
project is to create and validate mouse models that carry PC-causing mutations in relevant keratin genes and
exhibit key attributes of this disorder, in particular, PPK-like lesions in footpad skin. In Aim 1 we will complete
the characterization of a novel mouse strain carrying a R123C allele at the Krt16 locus, which we recently
generated in the laboratory. The corresponding allele in the human accounts for 21% of known cases of PC
involving KRT16 mutations (33 out of 157 cases). Aim 2 entails the creation and characterization of a new
strain carrying a N161del allele at the Krt6a locus. The latter occurs in >30% of KRT6A pedigrees (76 out of
249 cases) and also causes a classic PC presentation in the human. Strategies have been devised to use
chemical and genetic stressors to accentuate skin lesions relevant to PC in Krt16 R123C and Krt6a N171del
mouse strains, should they not arise spontaneously. The production and vetting of mouse models involving
mutations in two of the PC genes will yield an much needed in vivo platform to develop and test therapies for
this disorder."

The Veterans Health Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the largest and most diverse
learning health system (LHS) in the US, caring for more than 9 million patients annually in every state and US
territory. A full quarter of VA healthcare enrollees nationally live in HRSA-designated Health Professional
Shortage Areas (HPSAs). VA patients also have a greater burden of physical and mental health comorbidities
than the general US population. Nonetheless, a focus on performance measurement and improvement has
kept the quality of VA care as high or higher than in the private sector. This quality has been achieved by VA’s
innovation in implementation science and embodiment of LHS attributes, leveraging its vast clinical electronic
health record (EHR) data, robust informatics infrastructure, and patient-centered focus to continually evaluate
and improve patient care based on real-time monitoring and feedback. The VA is also a national leader in
clinical genomic medicine, including telegenetics, pharmacogenomics, and precision oncology. VA innovations
in genomic medicine have been driven by its LHS ecosystem of data-informed continuous quality improvement
(CQI), innovation, and national dissemination of implementation strategies found to be effective at local and
regional levels. In this project, VA will bring its national LHS infrastructure and genomic medicine
implementation strategies to a network of other genomics-enabled LHS. The network will conduct
implementation projects centered on a mainstream model for delivery of genomic medicine that promotes the
use of evidence-based, guideline-concordant genetic testing by frontline clinicians. The VA genomics-enabled
LHS will contribute to this network effort by 1) identifying and sharing with the network an implementation
approach and strategies with high potential for implementation across diverse healthcare systems, including
under-resourced settings; 2) proposing three implementation trials for network-wide conduct
(pharmacogenomic testing to optimize pharmacotherapy, germline testing to inform cancer treatment, and EHR
identification and germline testing to diagnose unrecognized monogenic disease); and 3) working with the
network to conduct implementation projects of genomic medicine interventions across a spectrum of clinical
conditions and patient characteristics within the VA genomics-enabled LHS and its community, recruiting
underserved populations and geographic areas. Through participation in this network, the VA will disseminate
its deep LHS expertise to other clinical sites and in turn bring the learnings from the larger network to improve
the genomic health care and outcomes of the nation’s military veterans, their families, and communities."
10992496,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The immune system plays key roles in brain development, but immune challenges in early life can also increase
the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Microglia, the dominant immune
cells of the brain parenchyma, mediate this brain-immune axis by regulating neural circuit development in
response to immune cues. A relatively unexplored function of microglia in early brain development is the
engulfment of whole neurons, which may engage distinct phagocytic mechanisms from those used, for example,
to remodel synapses. In preliminary experiments, we have identified a molecularly distinct subset of microglia in
the early postnatal mouse somatosensory cortex (P5) that is actively engulfing whole neurons. These microglia
express a Type I Interferon (IFN-I) responsive molecular signature and have a unique phagocytic morphology in
situ, frequently engulfing several neurons at a time. While these cells are rare in the typically developing cortex,
they expand 20-fold in somatosensory cortex in a partial whisker deprivation model that accelerates
developmental circuit remodeling. We find that both global and microglial-specific deletion of the IFN-I receptor
(Ifnar1) leads to dysmorphic microglial with enlarged phagolysosomes and an accumulation of neurons with
double strand DNA breaks, a damage/hyperexcitability marker. Our central hypothesis is that Type I Interferon-
responsive microglia promote somatosensory circuit maturation by eliminating specific neurons in early postnatal
development. We will test this hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will follow up on preliminary data
showing that Ifnar1-deficient juvenile animals have altered numbers of deep layer cortical neuronal subtypes,
with an increase in excitatory neuronal density, as well as hyperreactive sensory responses to whisker
stimulation. We will further examine these phenotypes in global and microglial-specific Ifnar1 deletion by
electrophysiology, behavior, and immunohistochemistry. Aim 2 will expand on our preliminary data showing that
exogenous IFN-I (IFN-) is sufficient to expand IRMs and reduce the number of neurons with dsDNA breaks.
Using our whisker deprivation and pharmacologic gain of function models, we will probe the sources and targets
of IFN-I in the developing brain, and the circuit impact of excess IFN-I signaling. Aim 3 follows up on our data
that identifies dsRNA sensing via MAVS as the potential molecular pattern that amplifies IFN-I responses in
these microglia. We will use in vivo conditional deletion and in vitro cocultures to define the sources and cellular
targets of dsRNA in developing cortex. Our long-term goal is fully define the unexpected implications of microglial
engulfment of neurons in cortical development, and more broadly, to define the novel homeostatic role of this
innate immune pathway in the developing nervous system. "

Ableism as a Mechanism of Physical and Mental Health Inequities Among Children with Visual Impairment
According to the Centers for Disease Control, approximately 3% of American children are blind or visually im-
paired – defined as having difficulty seeing even with correction. In the US, over 500,000 children who are
blind or visually impaired (CBVI) experience substantial functional impairments, activity limitations, and par-
ticipation restrictions, which are often exacerbated for CBVI from other minoritized groups. CBVI report lower
health related quality of life and experience higher rates of chronic health conditions and mental health disor-
ders compared to children with typical vision. Despite the prevalence of childhood blindness being greater than
or equal to other rare, but well-researched, childhood conditions (e.g., childhood leukemia), research is virtu-
ally nonexistent regarding psychosocial factors, such as ableism, that impact the physical and mental health of
CBVI. Ableism harms people with disabilities, including CBVI, by excluding them from full access to and par-
ticipation in cultural, educational, occupational, and recreational opportunities. Thus, there is a critical need to
understand how ableism contributes to health inequities experienced by CBVI. The objective of this research
project is to extend and expand our preliminary findings that highlighted a link between experiences of ableism
and poorer physical and mental health of CBVI by: (1) recruiting a first of its kind, large, diverse sample of
CBVI from across the United States; (2) obtaining detailed measures of distal (interpersonal discrimination,
victimization, rejection) and proximal (intrapersonal, affective, cognitive) ableism from the perspectives of
both caregivers and children; (3) using advanced multivariate analytic techniques to identify the contributions
of ableism – beyond other social determinants of health – to physical and mental health outcomes among
CBVI; and (4) obtaining multi-method, multi-informant assessments of physical and mental health status to
further validate our findings. By elucidating the impact of ableism on health inequities faced by CBVI, the pro-
posed research will foster the development of interventions for caregivers, educators, and healthcare providers
aimed at reducing ableist beliefs and actions and thereby having an important positive impact on health out-
comes for this population. We will achieve the overall objectives of this proposal by assessing 500 CBVI ages 9-
17 and their caregivers from across the United States with respect to both distal and proximal ableism (directed
towards the child) and child physical and mental health status. We will collect data on other potentially rele-
vant covariates including social determinants of health; type, degree, and age of onset of visual impairment;
and presence of other disabilities including hearing impairments, developmental disabilities, and motor disa-
bilities."

RNA viruses are an emerging health threat, evolving rapidly to proliferate and spread. Within these viruses are
structured RNA elements that facilitate infection and virus survival. Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) are a
type of RNA structure found within RNA viruses that facilitate infection by enabling initiating translation on the
viral genome when cellular translation is repressed during infection. The Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) contains an
IRES that has been extensively studied, demonstrating a mechanism of initiation intimately linked to RNA
architecture. The HCV IRES consists of a large, multi-domain structure that interacts directly with the small
ribosomal subunit (40S) and eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) to form an initiation complex. In tandem with
mechanistic and structural studies of the HCV IRES, a handful of other viruses with a similar structure– termed
HCV-like IRESs – have been sporadically identified through sequence homology. Despite demonstrating notable
structural diversity, HCV-like IRESs are inferred to share the same mechanism. I hypothesize that there are
distinct structural subgroups within the HCV class of IRESs and between these subgroups there are
differences in their initiation complex components and intermolecular interactions. In my first Aim, I will
define the structural diversity of HCV-like IRESs as a class using computational and biochemical methods. I
have performed a structure alignment-based search to mine the NCBI virus database, revealing 178 unique
putative IRESs. I will use computational methods to structurally characterize discrete regions of these putative
IRESs that differ between subgroups. Predicted IRES architecture and function will be validated biochemically
to link structural heterogeneity with translation initiation efficiency. For Aim 2, I will uncover the mechanistic basis
underlying the structural and functional differences among HCV-like IRES by investigating initiation complex
formation. I will determine both the composition of these IRES initiation complexes and the affinity of the IRES
for each component within the complex. Select IRES initiation complexes will be visualized using cryo-electron
microscopy, potentially revealing novel intermolecular interactions. The work outlined in this proposal will
enhance understanding of the relationship between HCV-like IRES structure and function. Further, this research
will provide insight into mechanisms of eukaryotic initiation that could be leveraged for use in vaccines and
therapeutics to combat RNA viruses."

 Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignancy of the female reproductive system, and despite advances
in understanding of the disease, therapeutic options for treating this disease are limited. Synthetic biology affords
the ability to engineer cell-based therapies, such as CAR T cells, that are programmable and targeted, and thus
provide a pathway for overcoming barriers to the treatment of solid tumors. CAR T cells have demonstrated
success in the treatment of hematological malignancies but have experienced challenges in their application to
solid tumors due to the lack of specific tumor antigens present on solid tumor cells, as well as the presence of
immunosuppressive microenvironments surrounding solid tumors. The hypoxic microenvironment ubiquitous to
solid tumors can be used as a biomarker to restrict CAR expression within a tumor, improving the safety and
specificity of solid tumor CAR T cell therapy, but so far this approach has only provided an effective anti-tumor
response at levels of profound hypoxia. Thus, strategies are needed to provide specific, anti-tumor responses in
tumors with modest levels of hypoxia that are not addressed by current approaches. To meet this need, we have
developed a hypoxia biosensor (HBS) circuit enhanced by positive feedback motifs, enabling fast transcriptional
output with minimal background signal. My objective is to engineer microenvironment-responsive CAR T cells
(Tune-Up CARs) containing this HBS circuit to improve the safety and potency of solid tumor CAR T cell therapy
for modestly hypoxic tumors. I hypothesize that the successful induction of this HBS circuit in the
engineered T cells within the tumor microenvironment will enable CAR expression at modest levels of
hypoxia and result in the tumor-localized delivery of immunostimulatory cytokines, inducing tumor
regression. In the first Specific Aim of the proposal, I will functionally implement the HBS circuit in human primary
T cells using transposon and lentiviral vectors to integrate the constructs into the T cell genome and evaluate
their performance in vitro. The second Specific Aim will focus on evaluating the engineered Tune-Up CAR T cells
to benchmark against current state-of-the-art technology in vivo. In the third Specific Aim, I will evaluate the anti-
tumor function and specificity of Tune-Up CAR T cells in vivo in a translationally relevant ovarian cancer model.
If successful, the proposed research will provide a new therapeutic technology for treating ovarian
cancer and inform engineering of new classes of hypoxia-responsive cell-based therapies."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common form of pancreatic cancer, with a 5-year survival
rate of only 12%. Immunotherapy, such as anti-PD1 antibody (α-PD1) treatment, has been largely ineffective in
PDAC. Although T cells and natural killer (NK) cells both have potent anti-tumor effects, most immunotherapy
research has focused on modulating T-cell activity. Thus, the function of NK cells is highly understudied in PDAC.
Utilizing imaging mass cytometry (IMC), a novel multiplex imaging platform, our laboratory has made the
surprising and potentially important observation that activated NK cells, but not T cells, preferentially
co-localize with tumor epithelial cells in the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME). This discovery warrants
investigating strategies and anti-tumor effects of increasing co-localization of activated NK and tumor cells. Here,
we demonstrate that pan-inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs), enzymes known to be involved in cancer
progression and blocking immune activation, using the pan-DPP inhibitor BXCL701 (701) enhances the efficacy
of α-PD1 therapy in syngeneic, murine PDAC models. This effect is associated with increased NK cell infiltration,
reduction in fibrosis, and increased expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-18. Notably, we found that individual
DPP inhibition demonstrates minimal anti-tumor effects as compared to pan-DPP inhibition. Furthermore, by
analyzing publicly available datasets and in vitro assays, we found that the NK cell-attractant chemokines CCL3
and CXCL11 are relatively underexpressed in PDAC. This suggests that creation of site-specific chemokine
gradients using CCL3/CXCL11 can serve to increase NK cell accumulation. Based on these observations, I
hypothesize that increasing co-localization of activated NK cells with tumor cells in PDAC will promote
anti-tumor effects. To test this hypothesis, I aim to determine the impact of DPP inhibition on the spatial and
functional status of NK cells in the murine PDAC TME utilizing IMC (Aim 1A), assess the therapeutic impact of
depleting CXCL9, CXCL10, and IL-18 on anti-tumor effects mediated by 701+α-PD1 therapy in vivo (Aim 1B),
and manipulate CCL3/CXCL11 expression in the PDAC TME to enhance NK cell migration in vitro (Aim 2A) and
anti-tumor responses in vivo (Aim 2B). Successful completion of these aims will identify factors that regulate NK
cell infiltration in the PDAC TME and the impact of NK cell-tumor epithelial cell co-localization on immune
responses. These findings will fill the gap in knowledge surrounding intra-tumoral NK cell migration, localization,
and functional status in PDAC and provide new approaches for exploiting NK cells to enhance anti-tumor immune
activity."

Dental plaque represents one of the most complex microbial communities or biofilms known to affect humans.
Oral biofilm-related diseases, e.g. dental carries, gingivitis, and periodontitis, impact a large population of all age
groups and continue to impose a huge economic burden due to the lack of effective therapies. The development
of dental plaque begins with the attachment of early colonizers to the tooth enamel, generating an adhesive
matrix that attracts intermediate and late colonizers. Actinomyces spp. are key early colonizers that play a
prominent role in biofilm development by their ability to interact directly with the tooth surface and both early and
intermediate colonizers. Therefore, our studies have focused on dissecting the adhesive properties, i.e. pilus
and non-pilus proteins, dictating these interactions and their assembly mechanism on the surface of Actinomyces
oris, the most abundant Actinomyces species in the human oral cavity. During the past grant period, we identified
a transmembrane protein named SafA in A. oris that is genetically linked to the housekeeping sortase SrtA (class
E sortase), the conserved transpeptidase enzyme that is central to the morphogenesis and cell wall anchoring
of pilus and non-pilus proteins. Specifically, safA deletion results in SrtA cleavage by signal peptidae LepB2 and
extracellular excretion of SrtA, concomitant of secretion of non-pilus proteins and most pili, while the remaining
cell-wall anchored pili are exceedingly long but unable to mediate bacterial coaggregation. Strikingly, the defects
of ∆safA in SrtA membrane localization, cell wall anchoring of pili and surface proteins, and coaggregation can
be rescued by ectopic expression of SafA homologs from Corynebacterium matruchotii and Corynebacterium
diphtheriae, suggesting the conservation of SafA-associated mechanism in Actinobacteria. Remarkably, the
∆safA mutant is severely defective in coaggregation with Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and in inhibition of Pg
growth, in contrast to wild-type cells. Intriguingly, in Bifidobacterium the housekeeping sortase SrtE contains a
C-terminal SafA domain, suggesting the co-evolutionary existence of class E sortases and SafA. Therefore, we
propose that SafA is an evolutionarily conserved antagonist of signal peptidase that topologically modulates
sortase function in polymicrobial interaction and biofilm formation. Using biochemical, genetic, and structural
approaches, we aim to test this central hypothesis by elucidating the antagonistic mechanism of SafA-mediated
topological modulation of sortase function in polymicrobial interaction and biofilm formation in A. oris, determining
the conservation of this SafA-associated mechanism and the co-evolutionary existence of class E sortases and
SafA in Actinobacteria, and examining how the SafA-associated mechanism modulates A. oris coaggregation
with Pg and Pg virulence. The conservation of sortase-mediated surface assembly and SafA-associated
mechanism in Actinobacteria thus magnify the significance of our studies on how SafA topologically modulates
sortase function in A. oris that likely affects the virulence potential of other oral pathogens."

 The cancer care delivery system frequently provides care that is not patient-centered, evidence-based,
or accessible to vulnerable and underserved populations. Cancer care and outcomes are particularly poor for
patients living in rural areas, areas with high poverty, racial/ethnic minorities, and patients with multimorbidity.
Recent advances such as genomic testing, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and CAR T cell therapy have
made oncology care more complex. Concurrently, there has been substantial integration and consolidation of
the delivery of cancer care, and little is known about how consolidation impacts cancer care and outcomes.
 As part of an Agency for Health Care Research and Quality initiative on Health Systems Organization
and Performance, our team created a novel national database (Enhanced DataBase [EDB]). The EDB
combines a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental proprietary sources to identify health systems
as groups of commonly owned providers and contains microdata on physicians, physician practices, hospitals,
and health systems.
 We propose to leverage longitudinal data from the EDB to characterize the integration of cancer care
over time, using these changes to understand effects on care delivery, including quality, diffusion of new
therapies, utilization, and outcomes. We will study care for patients enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare and
those enrolled in Medicaid. In addition to studying claims-based measures of quality and utilization, we will link
with clinical data about genetic testing and test results from Foundation Medicine, one of the country's largest
providers of somatic genomic testing. Specifically, we will:
1. Describe changes in integration and ownership of oncology care providers since 2010 and assess
 differences in these trends for providers serving large numbers of vulnerable or disadvantaged populations,
 including rural and urban poor patients, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals with multimorbidity.
2. Leverage changes in the organization of care to assess the impact of integration and health system
 affiliation on quality of care, outcomes, utilization, and spending for patients with cancer. We will examine
 quality across multiple domains, including care coordination, guideline recommended care, avoidance of
 low-value care, and patient experiences.
3. Understand the extent to which quality and value of cancer care delivered within vs. outside of integrated
 systems differs for various disadvantaged populations, including individuals living in rural and urban poor
 areas, racial/ethnic minorities, and individuals with multi-morbidity.
 Our study will provide oncology practitioners, payers, and policy makers valuable information to
improve access, quality and outcomes of oncology care. Our results will inform policies and practices related to
the value of integration of oncology care, quality measurement, and design of alternative payment models."

 Hispanics are the fastest growing minority population in the U.S., they are 1.5 times more likely to
develop Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and Hispanic ADRD informal caregivers
experience more burden the White non-Hispanics. There is an identified need to adapt interventions and
make them culturally relevant to meet the needs of Hispanic ADRD informal caregivers. My past research has
focused on examining cultural factors as they related to ADRD cognition and symptomatology. In the
proposed K23 application, I aim to fill an existing gap in my training by applying the knowledge I’ve gained in
regard to cultural factors among Hispanic ADRD populations and gain experience and training in clinical trial
research and methodology. I plan to pursue a career as an independently funded investigator in the field of
culturally tailored interventions for ADRD Hispanic caregivers and patients. The proposed study will use a
mixed method approach to conduct the necessary stage 0 and 1A activities of the NIH Stage model to assess
needs of Hispanic ADRD informal caregivers and develop modifications to Brain CareNotes, a secure mobile
telehealth application for informal caregivers to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia
(BPSD) with the aid of a remote care coach. Preliminary data on a general sample have shown that BCN
reduced caregiver burden (Neuropsychiatric Inventory [NPI]-Caregiver Distress) and BPSD at 3 and 6
months. Culturally tailoring this intervention requires more than just Spanish translation, but integration of
cultural factors which effect psychological and neurological functioning in both caregivers and ADRD patients.
Guided by an equity focused framework, PROGRESS Plus, I propose to culturally tailor BCN for Hispanic
ADRD caregivers. This will be accomplished by first conducting a needs assessment among Hispanic ADRD
informal caregivers (aim 1) in relation to managing BPSD and how equity factors play a role. I will then use
participatory co-design methods to adapt and modify Brain CareNotes (aim 2). Once the cultural adaptations
are complete, I will conduct a pilot study to ensure a future R01 proposed RCT will be powered to detect
reduction in Hispanic caregiver burden and BPSD among ADRD patients (NPI scores)."

Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support (DSMES) addresses the clinical, psychological, and
behavioral aspects of care needed to successfully self-manage diabetes. Despite the proven value of the
DSMES on patient outcomes, it remains underutilized. Only a small fraction of patients receive DSMES
within a year of being diagnosed with diabetes: 5% of those with Medicare and 6.8% of those with private
insurance. While the causes of low enrollment in DSMES are systemic and patient- and provider-based, the
role of the system-level factors, especially collaboration among providers, in DSMES utilization is not fully
understood. Since providers have a significant impact on whether patients attend DSMES, it is essential to
understand the practice patterns of providers regarding DSMES utilization. This K25 fills this gap in knowledge
by using 2 theoretical concepts—diffusion of innovations and social network analysis—to determine whether
patient-sharing relationships among the providers who care for patients with T2D is associated with DSMES
utilization. Aim 1 leverages health insurance claims for Medicare, Medicare Advantage and privately insured
patients to examine DSMES participation in Arkansas at the patient level. Aim 2 will construct a multilevel
network model comprising patients, providers, and a patient-sharing network of T2D providers. The network,
created using health insurance claims data, connects pairs of providers if they both deliver care to the same
patient. A multilevel statistical method, auto-logistics actor attribute models will examine whether the social
network structure of providers caring for T2D patients is associated with DSMES utilization. This project will
utilize membership, medical claims, and provider data for Medicare and Medicare Advantage enrollees (65
years old and above) and privately insured enrollees (aged 18 and above) from 2013–2020 from the Arkansas
All-Payer Claims Database.
 The principles of innovation diffusion suggest that the rate of diffusion of the adoption depends on
influential members of the social system (i.e., opinion leaders) adopting an innovation and their decision being
communicated to other members, who then follow their lead. Aim 3 examines the feasibility of identifying
opinion leaders through the use of self-designating survey instruments, providing a foundation that can
potentially be utilized to enhance DSMES uptake among providers. These aims will serve as a system-science
methodological approach to understand DSMES utilization given patient and provider characteristics and
patient-sharing relationship among providers. Understanding the network structure of T2D providers will
facilitate the identification of network intervention strategies to promote DSMES referral behavior among
providers. This K25 will provide the investigator with foundational training in network science and diffusion of
innovations and is aligned with her long-term career goal of becoming a productive independent researcher in
designing network interventions to improve diabetes care."
10985329,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death, and mitochondrial dysfunction is
implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) is a regulator of myocyte contraction,
and mutations in cTnI lead to hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive cardiomyopathies and sudden death. It is not
known why cTnI mutations have such heterogeneous phenotypes, and there are no targeted therapies for
cardiomyopathies caused by cTnI mutations. cTnI is regulated by phosphorylation and proteolytic truncation. We
recently showed that selectively inhibiting phosphorylation of cTnI by delta protein kinase C (δPKC) during
myocardial infarction using a lab-designed peptide inhibitor attenuates cardiac injury and prevents mitochondrial
dysfunction. My preliminary data show a novel role of cTnI in inhibiting mitochondrial function, and a therapeutic
benefit of preventing cTnI’s binding to mitochondrial ATP synthase using a peptide inhibitor in ischemic injury.
The objective of this application is to identify the mechanisms by which cTnI inhibits mitochondrial function and
to define the interplay between cTnI mutations and mitochondrial dysfunction in genetic cardiomyopathies. My
central hypothesis is that cTnI phosphorylation and truncation directly inhibit mitochondrial function, and
mutations in cTnI impair mitochondrial function to cause cardiomyopathy. This hypothesis will be tested in two
specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of cTnI phosphorylation and truncation on mitochondrial function and 2)
determine the effect of pathogenic cTnI mutations on mitochondrial function. In Aim 1, I will test the effect of
recombinant cTnI with phospho-mimetic amino acid substitutions and N-terminal truncation on ATP synthase
binding/activity and mitochondrial respiration. I will also express phospho-mimetic cTnI and N-terminal truncated
cTnI in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) to examine their effects on
mitochondrial structure/function and myocyte contractility/relaxation kinetics. In Aim 2, I will use hiPSC-CM and
transgenic mice with cTnI mutations to establish the effect of pathogenic mutations (causing hypertrophic, dilated
and restrictive cardiomyopathy) on mitochondrial function and test the effect of lab-designed peptide inhibitors
of cTnI phosphorylation and mitochondrial binding on mitochondrial function and contractility/relaxation in vivo.
This research is expected to identify a novel and therapeutically targetable role of cTnI in inhibiting mitochondrial
function and exacerbating myocardial remodeling in genetic cardiomyopathies. To successfully complete this
project, Dr. Elezaby’s educational goals include training in 1) rational drug design; 2) hiPSC-CM biology; 3)
genotype-specific mechanisms in genetic cardiomyopathies; 4) scientific communication; and 5) professional
development. His mentorship team includes world-renowned experts in mitochondrial and stem cell biology, drug
development, myocyte physiology, and cardiovascular genetics. His career development plan has been
designed to ultimately achieve his long-term goal of becoming a leading clinician-scientist investigating the
mechanistic underpinnings, therapeutic targets, and interplay between cardiac metabolism and cardiomyopathy."

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the genus Betacoronavirus and encode sets of specific
accessory proteins. Accessory proteins encoded by coronaviruses are not essential for the viral life cycle but are
important regulators that mediate immune evasion for optimal virus replication and propagation. One unique
feature of Betacoronavirus that is not seen in other genera of the family Coronaviridae is the presence of a small
accessory protein (I) encoded by the +1 open reading frame (ORF) relative to and within the ORF encoding the
nucleocapsid (N) gene. The internal (I) proteins of SARS-CoV (ORF9b), MERS-CoV (ORF8b) and SARS-CoV-
2 (ORF9b) have not been extensively characterized. However, in vitro experiments suggest that the I proteins of
these viruses have a role in suppressing IFN-I expression, which could potentially contribute to pathogenesis. In
this application, we hypothesize that the I protein is a virulence factor with functions specific to each virus. The
goal of this project is to study the roles of I proteins in pathogenesis and determine if I proteins possess functions
specific to viruses within the genus Betacoronavirus. We generated mutant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with
deletions of I protein expression without altering the coding sequence of the N protein by reverse genetics and
found that MERS-CoV lacking I protein expression showed increased virulence in mice, while the absence of
the SARS-CoV-2 I protein resulted in attenuation. It is intriguing that the absence of the I protein resulted in such
disparate changes in the virulence of the two related CoVs. In Aim 1, we will investigate the virus-specifc
functions of the I proteins by inserting the I protein of MERS- and SARS-CoV-2 into mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),
another betacoronavirus. In addition, we will interrogate the role of I proteins involved in regulating virus
production by interfering with the virus/host machinery required for virus replication. This will be performed by
analyzing the I protein interactome by mass spectrometry, detecting the presence of I protein in virions, which
would be consistent with a role in virion assembly and release, and comparing the viral life cycle in mutant vs.
parental virus-infected mice. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of the I protein in regulating immune responses by
comparing mice infected with mutant viruses or parental viruses. We will interrogate the role of IFN-I signaling
in the altered virulence of mutant viruses, as I proteins have been shown to suppress IFN-I induction in vitro. In
addition, changes in immune responses will be investigated by measuring inflammatory cytokines in the blood,
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and the lungs of mice infected with mutant or parental viruses. Immune profiling
of mice infected with mutant viruses will be performed and compared to mice infected with parental viruses by
scRNA-seq. The training and experiments proposed in this career development award will not only offer
invaluable opportunities for me to acquire new skills and techniques required for developing my own independent
research in viral immunology and pathogenesis but also address important questions regarding how specific
viral proteins act as virulence factors in coronavirus-infected cells."

The faithful segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is a fundamental and important
process, happening approximately a quadrillion time throughout a human life span. Errors in
mitosis have severe implications and are often detrimental to development, health and survival
of the organism. Microtubules are the main building blocks of mitotic spindles and are a very
important target for cancer therapy. We know that microtubules, in particular kinetochore
microtubules, exert forcSumes on chromosomes to initially position them on the metaphase
plate and consequently divide them to the two daughter cells. However, recent research has
shown that the central spindle also plays an important role in chromosome segregation. The
precise mechanisms of how the central spindle regulates chromosome segregation are not fully
understood by today. A line of evidence has suggested that the central spindle can generate
outward pushing forces to move chromosomes, but it has also been convincingly shown to slow
chromosome segregation down by acting like a break. The goal of this proposal is to dissect the
function of the central spindle during anaphase and to identify how the central spindle generates
forces contributing to the segregation of chromosomes. We further aim to establish the
contribution of microtubule dynamics for central spindle function.
To achieve this goal, we use the microstructural data from tomography in wild type and mutant
conditions to monitor the microtubule arrangement and properties in the central spindle during
anaphase and to identify potential interactions and force generating mechanisms. We will
complement the precise structural data with dynamic data on microtubules in the midzone
obtained by cutting edge light-microscopic analysis. We will use mathematical modeling to
develop and test hypothesis of how the spindle midzone contributes to chromosome
segregation in anaphase. The ultimate goal of our study is to understand how the central
spindle generates forces that regulate the segregation of chromosomes and to identify the
molecular key players of this process."

Among SES- and race/ethnicity-related health disparities in the U.S., 11 preventable conditions cause >50% of
mortality. Our preliminary modeling work suggests that only 9 prevention goals could attain 40% mortality
reduction from these 11 conditions, a 20% mortality reduction overall, because of interdependencies and
common pathways. For example, alcohol use disorder and/or heavy drinking (AUD/HD) impacts liver failure,
but also sexual risk-taking and medication nonadherence. But achieving mortality reduction would require a
radical transformation of preventive care, such as proposed here: personalization, navigation, and
compensation. Personalization means maximizing individual-level benefit by modulating intervention
characteristics in 3 three domains: (1) intensity of screening; (2) frequency of screening; and (3) intensity or
duration of response, based on individual harm/benefit profile and preferences. Navigation means reducing
barriers posed by fragmentation of health and social systems. Compensation means offsetting dependent care,
time costs, and travel costs relating to care based on cost-attribution methods used in cost-effectiveness
analysis. For this proposal, disparity-impacted means any SES, race/ethnicity, and sex strata among 35-64-
year-olds with substantially raised mortality (=1% per year). This R34 (n=150) is preparatory for a post-R34-
Goal of an n=15,000 5-year RCT which would have adequate power to test the hypothesis of 20% mortality
reduction. While the R34’s scope includes all 9 health goals, it focuses especially on AUD/HD, HIV risk and
cardiovascular (CV) risk. The overall objective of this administrative supplement is to preserve the parent
proposal’s intention to complement self-report measures used in screening and identification of AUD/HD with
quantitative data. Specifically, we seek to include biomarker testing for alcohol consumption,
Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) and Ethyl Glucuronide (EtG), at baseline and final (12 month) study time points.
Inclusion of these biomarkers is invaluable, it not only provides a more comprehensive and objective
assessment of alcohol consumption, reducing the potential for underreporting or inaccuracies, but also more
accurately identifies high-risk individuals who may be susceptible to alcohol-related health complications. Their
inclusion contributes significantly to our study's overarching goal of tailoring interventions to address the
unique health needs of each participant, ultimately leading to a more effective, cost-effective, and targeted
approach to reducing mortality in this population."

The force-gated ion channel Piezo2 plays a crucial role in various mechanosensory functions, including light
touch detection, proprioception, urination, blood pressure regulation, and lung inflation. Additionally, gain-of-
function and loss-of function mutations have been implicated in Gordon syndrome, distal arthrogryposis, and
overall deficits in proprioception. Given the crucial role of Piezo2 in physiologically significant mechanosensory
processes and its direct association with human diseases, it is imperative to gain a mechanistic understanding
of how Piezo2 functions as a sensor of mechanical stimuli. Although the physiological roles of Piezo2 are well
understood, its fundamental properties—specifically, the tension-response relationship and gating kinetics—
and how they both are affected by tissue-specific alternative splicing, are unknown.
The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the fundamental biophysical properties of the human
force-gated ion channel Piezo2 and systematically investigate six domains that undergo tissue-specific
alternative splicing to determine their necessity and sufficiency in modifying function. My rationale is that
knowing the biophysical properties of Piezo2 will enable us to understand its physiological roles in distinct
tissues and cell types.
I hypothesize that human Piezo2 and its splice variants exhibit distinct sensitivities and dynamic ranges in
membrane tension sensing and differ in their gating kinetics. The scientific premise for this hypothesis is
based on 1) the fact that Piezo2 is alternatively spliced in a tissue-specific manner, which implies an underlying
difference in function, and 2) my preliminary data demonstrating distinct tension-response relationships in two
Piezo2 splice variants. My research plan will determine the tension-response relationship (Aim1) and gating
kinetics (Aim2) of human Piezo2 and the effects of its six spliced domains on these properties.
The proposed research plan is innovative because it develops two innovative tools: Piezo2 constructs that
allow for a structure-function investigation of spliced domains and a rigorous and unbiased image analysis
program. It then applies these tools to explore two innovative concepts: quantification of the Piezo2 tension-
response relationship and the hypothesis that spliced domains affect both this property and gating kinetics.
The significance of this work is that it provides an understanding of the function and physiology of human
Piezo2. This is essential for rationalizing the purpose of Piezo2 tissue-specific splicing, interpreting structural
data of Piezo proteins, and comprehending the physiological forces, both in intensity and temporal dynamics,
Piezo2 can sense or not.
Its positive impact is that it will identify domains that selectively modulate Piezo2 function, which may become
targets for treating Piezo-related diseases, such as itch, inflammatory pain, and chronic pain."

This project will develop a novel molecular imaging technology that combines positron emission tomography
(PET) and ultrasound (US) imaging to enable interactive PET and US scanning with real-time visualization of
molecular contrast fused with US images. The motivation is to support an unmet clinical need of optimization
of personalized patient therapy. Ultrasound imaging is widely used for tissue biopsy. The biopsied tissue
samples permits molecular phenotyping and genotyping in order to better understand the pathobiology and to
identify druggable target(s) in diseased tissues to tailor the therapeutical regimen. Although the US-buided
biopsy is the current practice, its accuracy can be further improved by incorporating the PET tracer signal
localization within the target lesions.
The proposed technology builds upon a compact PET device that incorporates a robotic arm to interactively
scan a patient to acquire images from any organ-of-interest. Fast image reconstruction engine will enable real-
time visualization of molecularly targeting agents in organ/lesion for therapy optimization in individualized
precision medicine. An unique advantage of this technology is that it combines a compact PET device with
any existing clinical US scanner to enable the proposed PET/US imaging capability. These features will
support interventions such as image-guided biopsy by overcoming the hurdle due to the size and cost of
clinical PET scanners.
The outcome of this effort is a new class of compact molecular imaging (MI) technology that can provide
anatomic images, physiologic functions (such as speed of blood flow using Doppler US), and molecularly
targeted information for a wide range of point-of-care imaging applications. The real-time PET/US imaging
capability will disrupt the status quo and stimulate new applications of novel MI agents and MI-guided
interventions, analogous to the invention of PET/CT that completely revolutionized the clinical utility of PET.
Importantly, the cost of such system will be a fraction of a clinical PET/CT or PET/MR, making it the most
affordable hybrid molecular imaging device for deploying novel applications. Thus the proposed technology
development will address current unmet clinical needs and make long lasting scientific and societal impacts for
years to come."

psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, there is a medical need for the development of
RORyt-based therapies to treat these autoimmune diseases. However, inhibition of RORyt, that
ameliorates Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, also disrupts thymocyte development and
thus prevents the replenishment of the peripheral immune system with T cells critical for

An adaptive immunosuppressive microenvironment is a major barrier to immune-based therapies for solid
tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). Current model systems for preclinical development either lack substantial
components of the immune system or rely upon different species’ immune systems, which display significant
differences when compared to human immune systems. These deficiencies lead to the disconnect between
preclinical and clinical research. Here we propose to develop a humanized mouse system for the study of
immune system interactions with GBM. By taking hematopoietic stem cells from a GBM patient, we will engraft
a human immune system in mice. From the same patient, we will obtain tumor tissue and T cells. This will allow
creation of an autologous mouse system, where the components, immune system, tumor, and cell-based
therapy, all come from the same source. In doing so, we aim to avoid any complications that would arise from
cells coming from multiple individuals.
 We will validate the autologous mouse system by generating chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells
from the patients’ own T cells. These redirected T cells will allow for evaluation of the model system, both in
terms of how the tumors respond to immunotherapy and how the existing immune system responds to
immunotherapy. Results in the animal model will be compared to patients receiving the same treatment, in clinical
trials at the University of Pennsylvania.
 Initial work for will focus on demonstrating the fidelity of the system to the originating tumor and immune
microenvironment, in terms of both tumor characteristics and immune system response. Thorough
characterization of immune cell subpopulations and anti-tumor activity will help identify discrepancies in the
current models as well as areas in which the new, autologous models are preferable. At the conclusion of this
project, we will have demonstrated the feasibility of using autologous materials for glioblastoma modeling and
elucidated the aspects of tumor-immune interaction that these models are most suited for use in."

of biomedical informatics techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) for mining inference and
classifying EHR data. Combining digital health records and available analytical tools represents an
opportunity to improve care for patients who suffer from rare disease such as primary immune deficiency
(PID) where optimal outcomes are predicated upon early detection. However, only a fraction of PID
patients receive a diagnosis before sustaining serious infections. This underscores a need for novel methods
to improve diagnostic rates and for driving understanding about PID. At present, barriers to detecting
PIDs include recognizing heterogeneous clinical features, distinguishing infections in PID from that of the
normal host, and general lack of awareness about the diseases. Creating precise analytical methods to
mine and make predictions from EHR data represents a potential solution to these challenges. As such
our goals are to develop a system for automatic extraction of PID risk indicators from EHR notes for the
purpose of improving widespread diagnosis and advancing knowledge about human immunologic disease.
Our preliminary work suggests that structured EHR data such as problem list elements and diagnostic
codes can be used to develop a probabilistic framework for assessing risk of PID but they are limited and
do not exemplify the full range of concepts needed to optimally characterize PID. Data elements mined
from text can couple to presently available EHR structured data and ontologies for improved annotation
of PID. Building a framework of PID-specific risk indicators will enable NLP approaches for PID detection
and improved understanding about human immune dysfunction. The Specific Aims for our proposal are
as follows: 1.) To use a data-driven approach for identifying and enumerating PID risk indicators from
EHR text. 2.) To develop NLP methods for automatically extracting key PID risk indicators from EHR text.
Our proposal leverages a very large corpus of EHR note text captured from over 3000 PID patients prior
to their ultimate diagnosis, as well as over 285,000 control patients. Mining this dataset and synergistically
using state-of-the-art NLP methodologies will build the foundation of a potent and interoperable text
mining system for PID risk detection. We expect this work to advance disease detection, characterization
of specific human immune defects and allow for additional inference which combines clinical, laboratory,
and molecular information about PID."

Candidate’s Long-Term Career Goal: To become an independently funded, leading physician-scientist
focused on advancing health equity through multilevel implementation interventions that increase evidence-
based care and improve the health outcomes of patients with heart failure.
Clinical Problem: Heart failure is common, costly, and deadly, with a disproportionate burden among
underserved groups. Evidence-based therapies that improve outcomes, including mortality, are not
implemented adequately, and disparities exist in the receipt of treatments for underserved groups.
Candidate Background: Dr. Cascino is a Clinical Instructor in the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine at the
University of Michigan (U-M). He received an MD from Loyola University Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine
and an MSc in Health and Healthcare Research from U-M. He has published 49 papers, including 38 original
peer-reviewed manuscripts, 14 of which he is the first or senior author. He has been awarded four internal
grants from U-M, a departmental T32, and an institutional K12.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Cascino will develop new skills in health equity-centered research, electronic
health record (EHR) observational data analyses, mixed-methods, and implementation intervention design
through a combination of intensive mentorship, didactic course work, participation in a community of scientists,
progressively independent research, and on-the-job-training.
Specific Aims: 1) Assess multilevel variation in equitable guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)
prescribing during an acute heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) admission, 2) Identify and
prioritize determinants to promote the equitable implementation of GDMT prescribing in the hospital setting,
and 3) Design the components of a multilevel implementation intervention using implementation science
methods to address prioritized determinants of equitable inpatient GDMT prescribing.
Research Plan: Dr. Cascino will employ an implementation mapping process framework to 1) use multi-health
system electronic health record data from PCORnet to understand multilevel factors that are associated with
variation in GDMT prescribing for admitted HFrEF patients considering race, sex, and socioeconomic status, 2)
use explanatory sequential mixed methods including qualitative interviews with key stakeholders to identify and
prioritize determinants of GDMT prescribing, and 3) design the components of a multilevel implementation
intervention targeting prioritized determinants to promote equitable inpatient GDMT prescribing.
Impact: The proposed research will advance the understanding of inpatient GDMT prescribing for patients with
HFrEF and prepare Dr. Cascino to write an R-level application for a multi-site trial evaluating the
implementation of a multilevel intervention to increase equitable access to lifesaving HFrEF therapies."

There is significant potential for patient care enabled by genomics to enable transformational improvements in
health. However, the actual uptake of genomic medicine into clinical care has been limited to date. The
University of Utah (UU) Genomics Learning in the Utah Ecosystem (GLUE) Center will contribute to a
Genomics-Enabled Learning Health Systems (gLHS) Network that will catalyze the wide implementation of
genomic medicine. The GLUE Center will offer the gLHS Network unique expertise, collaborations, and
resources to address key areas of need, including the UU ReImagine EHR Initiative, which has been a pioneer
in leveraging electronic health record (EHR) interoperability standards to improve patient care and the provider
experience at scale; Value-Driven Outcomes, an enterprise platform for assessing and improving care value and
efficiency; the Genetic Cancer Risk Detector (GARDE), a standards-based platform for population-level genetic
screening; the Mendelian Phenotype Search Engine (MPSE), which continuously analyses the EHR to identify
patients most likely to benefit from rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS); and extensive experience working
with safety-net clinics to reduce healthcare disparities through scalable informatics interventions. As a gLHS
Network site, the GLUE Center will pursue three Aims to contribute our expertise and ensure the success and
broad impact of the network. First, we will provide vision, infrastructure and expertise to the gLHS Network
and enable Network-wide implementation of interoperable interventions, including for pharmacogenomics
(PGx). We will contribute open-source tools and interoperability expertise to enhance the scalability of
interventions chosen for Network-wide dissemination, including for providing PGx guidance. Second, we will
support Network-wide dissemination of the standards-based GARDE clinical decision support platform for
population-based genetic testing. An open-source, standards-based tool that leverages AI and chatbot
technologies, GARDE has been successfully used in a multi-site pragmatic clinical trial to identify, reach,
educate, and facilitate at-home genetic testing of hereditary cancer syndromes. GARDE can be adapted to
facilitate genetic testing for any condition chosen by the Network. Given its public health importance, we
propose the Network focuses on genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia. Third, we propose the real-
time identification of critically ill newborns most likely to benefit from rWGS. At Rady Children’s Hospital-
San Diego and the UU Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), we deployed an automated, open-source pipeline
(MPSE) that prioritizes patients for rWGS using Human Phenotype Ontology terms derived directly from the
EHR. Here, we propose a pilot deployment of MPSE at NICUs across the network for daily, automatic review
of evolving medical records to prioritize newborns for clinically indicated rWGS. Through these efforts, the
GLUE Center will contribute critical and unique expertise that will help ensure the Network is successful in its
mission to discover and disseminate effective and equitable strategies for enabling genomic medicine at scale."
10985747,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death among critically ill patients in the United States, and costs of sepsis for
Medicare beneficiaries exceed $62 billion annually. Outside of antibiotics, treatment for sepsis is non-specific,
and there are no approved therapeutics available once antibiotics and supportive therapy fail. Patients with
cancer are nearly ten times more likely to develop sepsis than the general population, and cancer represents
the most common co-morbidity in septic patients. Moreover, cancer is the co-morbidity associated with the
highest risk of death in sepsis, and the increased mortality is seen disproportionately in younger adult patients.
The gut has long been characterized as the motor of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. All major elements
of gut integrity are altered in sepsis, with dysregulation in the epithelium (permeability, apoptosis, proliferation,
migration), the microbiome and the mucosal immune system. Further, both immunity and gut integrity are
disproportionately impacted in cancer/sepsis hosts compared to previously healthy/sepsis hosts. This program
seeks to understand mechanisms underlying dysregulated gut integrity in sepsis. The first approach will be to
examine what happens within the epithelium, the mucosal immune system and the microbiome, to elucidate
mechanisms of sepsis-induced intestinal alterations within individual processes in isolation. The next approach
will be to examine crosstalk between the three broad components of the gut since each element directly
impacts each other, leading to further alterations in all. The final approach will be to examine how the gut leads
to extra-intestinal effects on distant organs, where gut-derived changes lead to subcellular, cellular and organ
dysfunction, resulting in worsened morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the program seeks to understand why
outcomes are different in cancer/sepsis, by examining differences seen in both the adaptive immune system
and gut integrity. A “one size fits all” approach to an inherently heterogeneous syndrome is likely a key reason
why more progress has not been made in decreasing mortality from sepsis clinically, and the goal of
understanding mechanisms of how a chronic co-morbidity leads to different outcomes at the bedside is to
move towards precision medicine in septic patients. The program will use human samples (gut, blood and
stool) paired when feasible with clinical data and outcomes. Mechanistic questions will then be approached
using a bedside to bench paradigm whereby insights obtained examining human samples will then be
evaluated using a variety of in vivo and in vitro techniques when experiments cannot be performed in patients.
Since the gut plays a major role in both initiating and propagating critical illness and co-morbidities play a
crucial role in worsening outcomes in septic patients, understanding mechanisms through which gut integrity is
dysregulated in sepsis especially in hosts with cancer has significant public health implications in a disease
that is common, very costly, and highly lethal."
10990023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute exposure to ultrapotent synthetic opioids (UPSO), such as fentanyl, represents a significant public health
concern. In the ongoing opioid epidemic, it is estimated that UPSO exposure contributes to over 80% of
overdose-related deaths. The current defense strategy against UPSO exposure has been the development of
reversal agents, such as naloxone, that aim to effectively reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression and
related secondary complications with breathing. However, the high potency of UPSO decreases the window of
time in which a counteragent can be administered before UPSO-dependent cardiorespiratory collapse (CRC)
occurs and immediate resuscitative action is required. Optimal strategies for resuscitation following UPSO-
dependent CRC are unknown. Resuscitation increases the risk for hypoxic-ischemic reperfusion injury (HIRI),
which can lead to additional morbidity and death despite reversal of the opioid-mediated effects on breathing.
Critical knowledge gaps exist in understanding how UPSO exposure impacts post-resuscitative outcomes in vital
organ systems such as the heart, lungs, and brain. These gaps are a significant roadblock to successfully
minimizing the morbidities and mortalities associated with UPSO exposure. Proposal Objective: Establish a
foundational understanding of the cellular and systemic outcomes after reversing fentanyl-induced CRC (fiCRC).
We have developed a novel model of fiCRC where we observe pulmonary edema following naloxone
administration and reversal of respiratory depression, closely modeling documented clinical observations.
Central Hypothesis: Factors beyond respiratory depression contribute to the progression of fentanyl overdose,
leading to injury following the reversal of fiCRC; these factors are tractable targets in minimizing injury due to
fentanyl overdose and its reversal. We propose the following aims to test this. Aim 1: Characterize how fentanyl
and the reversal of OIRD impact the relationship between breathing and O2 consumption, mitochondrial activity,
and tissue-specific glucose metabolism. Aim 2: Characterize physiological outcomes of fentanyl overdose and
reversal of fiCRC in the cardiopulmonary system and brain. Aim 3: Test the efficacy of adjunctive strategies
during naloxone-mediated reversal of fiCRC to improve outcomes in the cardiopulmonary system and brain. This
proposal and its aims align with RFA-DA-23-056 to support mechanistic investigations into persistent/delayed
pathophysiological effects following acute UPSO exposure."

We propose to develop and disseminate an advanced 2p Bessel beam light sheet (2pBLS) microscopy
instrument for high-speed sub-micron-resolution volumetric imaging in deep tissue. The proposed instrument will
have a significantly higher volume imaging speed over a large field of view, maintain a sub-micron diffraction-
limited resolution in deep tissue despite the presence of tissue scatter and aberration, and perform simultaneous
lifetime imaging with FRET sensors and high-speed light sheet imaging of dynamics intensity-modulated sensors
for dual functional imaging in deep tissue. The system will be tested with two imaging studies in zebrafish and
mouse respectively. In zebrafish, we will demonstrate live FLIM imaging of genetically encoded FRET sensors
in zebrafish kidney and perform an imaging study of Ca2+ and cAMP activities in zebrafish renal cells. In mice,
we will demonstrate imaging of neural and glial activities genetically labeled with activity sensors (Ca2+ and GEVI),
FLIM-FRET sensors (PKA) and structural markers ex vivo and in vivo."
10990212,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Kawasaki disease (KD), an acute febrile illness and systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology, is the leading cause
of acquired heart disease among children in the US. Coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) develop in as many as
25% of untreated KD patients, resulting in ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and even death.
Although intravenous IgG (IVIG) treatment within the first 10 days of illness significantly reduces the likelihood
of cardiovascular complications, up to 25% of KD patients are IVIG-resistant and at higher risk of developing
CAA. Therefore, a better understanding of the immune and pathological mechanisms leading to the development
of KD vasculitis is needed to identify more efficacious KD therapeutics and prevent the long-term cardiovascular
sequelae stemming from tissue inflammation and coronary remodeling. KD occurs more frequently in males, and
male patients experience more severe disease than female patients. However, the mechanisms underlying this
sex disparity are unknown. In both the human disease and a murine model of KD vasculitis, the NLRP3-IL-1β
axis has been identified as a key driver of pathogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate that vascular tissue-
infiltrating monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells are the main cellular sources of IL-1β during murine KD.
We have also shown that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) surrounding the coronary artery undergo a
phenotype switch, acquiring properties of fibromyocytes and synthetic VSMCs. This phenotype switch may
contribute to luminal myofibroblast proliferation in the murine model of KD vasculitis. Importantly, we find
enhanced IL-1β production and signaling, increased inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils, and enhanced
VSMC phenotype switching in male KD mice compared with females. Based on our strong published and
preliminary evidence, our central hypothesis is that differences in IL-1β-mediated immune-stromal cell
interactions drive the sex disparity in KD. We will test this hypothesis in the following aims: Establish the
contribution of monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils to disease pathogenesis in male and female mice
during LCWE-induced KD vasculitis (Aim 1); Establish the contribution of sex differences in vascular smooth
muscle cell function to sexual dimorphism in LCWE-induced vasculitis (Aim 2). The completion of these studies
will determine the fundamental mechanisms that mediate sex-based differences in cardiovascular lesion
development in KD, which may lead to novel therapeutic approaches."

Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of years lost to disability worldwide, is characterized by the breakdown of
the collagen II-rich matrix of articular cartilage, infiltration of immune cells, and inflammation of joint tissues such
as the synovium. Because no disease-modifying drugs exist to treat arthritis, surgery is the eventual result for
patients with progressive OA. Though current biologic therapies for treating OA offer some clinical benefit,
outcomes deteriorate over time due to the inability of these approaches to induce robust, sustained
regeneration of cartilage and stabilization of joint tissues. Investigational cell engineering strategies have
been developed to overcome the limitations of current regenerative medicine approaches, but these strategies
fail to regulate cell functions based on reliable signatures of disease. Lack of such disease-dependent
regulation of cell behaviors can lead to aberrant cell activities that negatively impact health or fail to mitigate
disease. Here, we propose to leverage advanced cell design platforms to confine expression of transgenes
to sites characterized by joint degeneration. Our approach builds on our use of a customized cell
sense and response system in musculoskeletal bioengineering. This synthetic biology signaling
system enables us to enlist cells as programmable agents that implement defined regenerative
procedures when they encounter selected features of a microenvironment. Our prior studies have illustrated
that exposed collagen II serves as a diagnostic hallmark of OA. This proposal capitalizes on our recent
demonstration that an engineered synthetic receptor designed to detect collagen II selectively licenses
mesenchymal stem cells to detect damaged cartilage and then upregulate expression transgenes known to
promote cartilage synthesis and attenuate inflammatory signaling associated with OA. The overall goal of
our work is to establish synthetic receptor-controlled, joint-resident cells as agents to coordinate cartilage
repair and antagonize inflammation in the arthritic joint. This project will characterize the ability of our
receptors to drive T cells and synoviocytes to mediate cartilage repair in an in vitro model of arthropathy (Aim
1) and will assess the ability of transplanted, synthetically programmed cells to detect and respond to cartilage
degeneration in an in vivo model of post-traumatic OA (Aim 2). Finally, Aim 3 will establish feasibility of
deploying this technology in the context of an off-the-shelf gene therapy capable of programming cells in situ to
respond therapeutically to damaged cartilage."

Recent research in the study of brain functions is highlighting the important role of glial cells in
several human neurological and psychiatric disorders. The dopaminergic control of brain
functions is classically assigned to the effect of dopamine on neurons. However, D2R
expression has also been reported in astrocytes, questioning what their contribution in the
dopamine-dependent control of brain functions is.
Based on preliminary evidence showing an increase of astrocytes and microglia in the PFC of
mice with an altered control over dopamine synthesis and release, we hypothesize that D2R
signaling in astrocytes influences the activity of neighboring cells and induces microglia
proliferation. This mechanism could play a role in the control of PFC dependent behavior, gene
expression in astrocytes and microglia, as well as on the metabolites that they produce.
Thus, we propose to perform experiments to determine the impact of D2R signaling in astrocyte
on PFC functions. We will use viral vectors to knockdown D2R specifically in astrocytes in mice
with either a normal control of dopamine synthesis and release or in mutants where these
functions have been altered. This project is timely due to the increased involvement of glia in
brain disorders and promises to elucidate mechanisms previously unexplored."

Latinx children in the United States (US) are more than 50% more likely to die of their cancer diagnosis in
comparison to non-Latinx White children due to systemic inequities which arise from adverse social
determinants of health (SDOH). Latinx families in the US face several adverse SDOH including discrimination
based on race/ethnicity, language, or culture, and inequitable social structures that limit their access to various
resources, all of which affects their child’s risk of developing and dying from cancer and aggravate
bereavement and grief inequities among family members, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress
disorder, and social isolation. Despite higher cancer mortality, there remains a striking under representation of
Latinx populations in the study of pediatric bereavement. Further, the identification of resiliency factors has
remained undiscovered because the experience of cancer loss in Latinx populations has not yet been explored
from a culturally and contextually grounded, strength-based perspective. The overall purpose of this study is
to explore the culturally grounded experiences and grief outcomes of Latinx families in the US who are living
through the loss of a child to cancer. This study will utilize a modified version of the Center for Latino
Adolescent and Family Health Framework of SDOH Mechanisms, that has been integrated with culturally
grounded grief concepts in a mixed methods design that integrates data from validated measures representing
the framework’s domains (n=60), with qualitative descriptive data from individual interviews (n=~20) with the
deceased child’s primary caregiver. The aims are to: Aim 1: To examine relationships among the domains of
the SDOH mechanisms of Latinx families in the US who are living through the loss of a child to cancer
including SDOH capital (healthcare access), SDOH processes (acculturation stress), contextual exposures
(social meaning-making), resiliency factors (Latinx culture) and critical grief outcomes (coping, mental health,
post-traumatic growth, continuing bonds) through self-reported measures. Aim 2: To elucidate the experiences
of Latinx families in the US who are living through the loss of a child to cancer in the context of SDOH
mechanisms (SDOH capital, SDOH processes, contextual exposures, resiliency factors, critical grief
outcomes) through in-depth, individual semi-structured qualitative interviews. Aim 3: To develop a
comprehensive understanding of how multilevel resiliency factors across the domains of SDOH mechanisms
(healthcare access, acculturation stress, social meaning-making, culture, critical grief outcomes) influence
adaptive grief outcomes among Latinx families in the US after the loss of a child to cancer by integrating data
from self-reported measures and qualitative interviews. The findings will enhance the understanding of the
mechanisms of inequities in pediatric oncology bereavement outcomes that can affect Latinx bereaved families
and inform the development of culturally grounded interventions to address them."
10994967,"General thoracic and adult cardiac (“cardiothoracic”) surgical procedures are among the most frequently
performed high-risk inpatient procedures. Despite technological advances and quality improvement initiatives
(e.g., outcomes reporting), major complications remain common (10-34%), vary by hospital (4%-35%), increase
the risk of mortality (atrial fibrillation: 3%; cardiac arrest: 49%) and add $6K-$34K to expenditures.
Emerging data linking surgeon operative performance, encompassing technical and non-technical (e.g.,
communication, decision-making) skills, with patient outcomes after non-cardiac surgery reveals that surgical
technical skills are necessary yet alone are insufficient for achieving high performance. Researchers have
evaluated both faculty and trainee (i.e., interns, residents and fellows) cardiothoracic surgeon operative
performance with validated taxonomies; yet, this work has: (1) often been conducted within simulated scenarios
lacking medical and psychological challenges of real-world surgery and (2) lacked structure to improve and
monitor performance over one’s career. Relevant to these observations are developments within the discipline
of sport (e.g., professional tennis) that have pioneered advanced performance parameters for athletes. The U.S.
Tennis Association (USTA), for instance, develops data-driven analytics applied to annotated in-game video to
analyze technical, tactical and physical ability and emotional regulation as important tools to develop athletes,
especially during high-intensity situations. The application of USTA’s Player Development approach to surgeons
uniquely advances real-world surgeon-specific operative performance parameters given the increased use of
digital technology and similarities between athletes and surgeons that extend to the following surgical domains:
(1) technical (e.g., economy of motion); (2) tactical (e.g., sequencing of tasks); (3) cognitive (e.g., situation
awareness); and (4) physical (e.g., stamina, ergonomics). While biomarkers reflecting a player’s physiology (e.g.,
heart rate variability) and human factors (e.g., fatigue, task load) are measured within sport, their role in
explaining additional variance in surgical outcomes beyond operative performance ratings is understudied.
Our long-term goal is to enhance surgical outcomes by identifying and promoting the wide-scale adoption of
evidence-based operative performance practices. The objective of this proposal is to obtain validity evidence
supporting the development of a surgeon-specific performance index for cardiothoracic surgery. The proposed
multi-center study leverages our team’s expertise in applying data analytics to recorded, real operative video,
and a unique partnership with USTA’s Player Development program. We have the following aims: (1) Develop a
multidomain cardiothoracic surgeon operative performance index; (2) Identify biomarkers associated with a
surgeon’s operative performance; and (3) Qualitatively assess determinants of a surgeon’s optimal operative
performance. This study’s findings will advance the scientific field through validity evidence to inform trials to
improve performance and outcomes for surgeons and interventionalists more broadly."

Post-stroke impairments, including muscle weakness, hyperactive muscle (hypertonia) and associated stretch
reflexes (spasticity), and loss of independent joint control (flexion synergy), pose significant challenges to routine
daily activities, making stroke a leading contributor to motor dysfunction in the United States.
Our extensive research has identified abnormally increased motor neuron excitability post-stroke, hinting at
elevated spinal norepinephrine (NE) levels. NE, a potent neuromodulator, not only intensifies and prolongs inputs
to motoneurons but also increases reliance on indirect contralesional cortico-reticular tracts, as shown in the
previous cycle of this R01 grant. Our central hypothesis suggests that reducing NE levels will diminish spinal
motoneuron excitability, encourage the use of direct motor pathways from the lesional hemisphere, and improve
motor performance in individuals post hemiparetic stroke.
To validate this hypothesis, we will evaluate the impact of the drug Tizanidine (Zanaflex®, TIZ) on spinal
motoneuron excitability, motor cortical activity, descending pathways utilization, and motor behavior of the paretic
arm and hand in chronic hemiparetic stroke across various aims. More specifically, in Aim 1 we propose to
evaluate Tizanidine's effect on spinal motoneuron excitability using high-density surface EMG during isometric
tasks. Aim 2 will explore NE's role in amplifying the use of indirect motor pathways through EEG/EMG signals
and kinetics during isometric shoulder abduction and hand-opening tasks. Aim 3 will examine NE's modulation
of flexion synergy and spasticity, assessing spasticity expression before and during movement, as well as
reaching distance and hand-opening ability as a function of shoulder abduction loading using a novel robotic
paradigm.
Anticipated results are expected to illustrate how NE-driven pathophysiological adaptations contribute to motor
impairments in chronic stroke. This understanding will inform more effective rehabilitative strategies, integrating
pharmacology with targeted physical interventions, aiming to enhance upper limb motor function and improve
the quality of life for individuals post-hemiparetic stroke."
10995106,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Effective communication strategies are urgently needed to convey the relative risks of tobacco products
accurately among adults who currently use combustible tobacco while minimizing such appeal among youth
populations. There is a significant gap in research on the impacts of communicating the continuum of tobacco
products risks to diverse audiences. Current research has primarily been limited to cross-sectional studies of
single message exposures among adults. As such, there is insufficient evidence on how messaging about the
continuum of risk of tobacco products would influence the message response, receptivity, behavioral
precursors, and tobacco use behaviors among the diverse audiences that these messages must reach. The
long-term objective of this project is to optimize future public health communication on the continuum of risk for
tobacco products to minimize tobacco use harms among adults who use tobacco products and prevent youth
initiation and progression of tobacco product use. Our proposed project, in direct response to RFA-OD-23-021,
will assess the effects of FDA tobacco product risk continuum messaging on adult users of combustible
tobacco products (including those who have not yet been able to quit) and youth/young adults using an
integrated study design that captures the full range of relevant outcomes, from immediate message response
and receptivity to longer-term behavior. This project is guided by a theoretical framework integrating key
constructs in health communication (Message Impact Framework), persuasion (McGuire's persuasion
framework), behavioral economics, and behavioral change theories (Reasoned Action). Our specific aims are
to: (1) Generate rankings of messages and identify effective message features based on perceived message
effectiveness, and message comprehension; (2) Characterize effects of messages and message features on
response and receptivity, and precursors to behavior, including behavioral intentions, and (3) Specify
immediate and long-term behavioral effects of tobacco product risk continuum messages. Approach: We will
deploy a nimble framework to: refine messaging and develop control messages (message rating survey,
cognitive interviews); formally test message response, receptivity, and effects on behavioral precursors (online
national experiments, eye-tracking and neuroimaging); and assess immediate and long-term effects on
behavior (mobile device-based message delivery and laboratory smoking topography studies) among samples
of adults who use combustible tobacco, youth/young adults who use non-combustible tobacco, and
youth/young adults who do not use tobacco. Impact: The successful completion of this project will provide FDA
with clear, rigorous, and comprehensive evidence regarding the effectiveness of the specific messages
provided for this study, as well as theory-informed insights regarding broader message strategies to optimize
future public health communication on the continuum of risk for tobacco products to diverse audiences."

This K01 proposal seeks to provide Dr. Omid Kardan, an early-career environmental neuroscientist, with the
mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent research-oriented
investigator focused on 1) the impact of the physical environment on neurodevelopmental risk factors for
Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) and 2) leveraging this knowledge to inform SUD prevention efforts in at-risk
youth. The candidate will work towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused
on predicting trajectories of Executive Control and Attention function (ECA) in youth as a function of brain
architecture and environment. Specifically, the project aims to construct robust whole-brain network predictors
of normative ECA development throughout adolescence, assess if attenuated trajectory of growth in these
network predictors is related to initiation/escalation of Substance Use Behaviors (SUB), and identify physical
environmental factors that contribute to lower-than-expected ECA development and subsequent SUB outcomes.
Research in environmental psychology and epidemiology has found physical environmental factors such as
neighborhood air pollution, low greenspace, and high visual disorderliness to be associated with negative
cognitive and developmental outcomes. However, there is currently no large scale, replicable research in which
neurocognitive, socioeconomic (SES), and physical environmental factors are conjointly used to make reliable
and generalizable predictions of SUB trajectory for individual youth. The candidate will combine his existing
expertise in environmental neuroscience with new training in developmental neuroscience of SUDs and
longitudinal methods in analysis of multivariate data to elucidate the role of the environment in the emergence
of SUD-related brain phenotypes. The candidate will conduct extensive analyses with one large dataset
(Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study), and two datasets enriched for at-risk families and low-income
neighborhoods (Michigan Longitudinal Study and Michigan Twins Neurogenetics Study) to 1) Construct
multivariate neuromarkers of ECA trajectory in adolescence and investigate their relationship with SUBs, and 2)
Determine neighborhood SES and physical environmental factors that are related to SUB and predict trajectory
differences in neuromarker for ECA. Completion of the following training objectives will ensure that the candidate
can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent investigator who is well-
equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Increase knowledge about SUD risk factors and
SUBs 2) Gain expertise in advanced statistical methods to analyze longitudinal multivariate data, and 3) Increase
knowledge about contextual influences in neurodevelopment in adolescence. Completion of the proposed K01
goals will be a crucial step towards the utilization of environmental neuroscience methods that may ultimately
inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying multi-level predictors of early SUD risk, and set up the candidate to
independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal."

MDM2 amplification occurs in 3.5% of all malignancies and in approximately 10% of several highly aggressive
malignancies, including glioblastoma. MDM2 is a critical negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53, and
high-level MDM2 amplification results in functional inactivation of p53 and is a genomic-driver event in
tumorigenesis of these tumors. Even in tumors with ‘normal’ MDM2 expression, disruption of the MDM2/p53
pathway can trigger apoptosis. In this context, multiple pharmaceutical companies have developed potent
MDM2 inhibitors that are in advanced clinical development for a variety of malignancies. In our studies with a
highly potent MDM2 inhibitor from Boehringer Ingelheim (Brigimadlin; BI 907828), we found that MDM2-
amplified glioblastoma (GBM) and sarcomas are exquisitely sensitive to this drug. Specific to MDM2-amplified
tumors, drug treatment is associated with degradation of the pro-survival MCL1 protein and upregulation of
other pro-apoptotic proteins. Moreover, brigimadlin treatment results in suppression of multiple DNA repair
pathways that are critical for recovery from both endogenous and exogenous genotoxic stress. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that the combination of enhanced apoptosis and an inability to repair DNA
damage creates a unique vulnerability of MDM2-amplified GBM to brigimadlin. We will test this in three Aims:
Aim 1: Evaluate mechanism of exquisite MDM2 inhibitor sensitivity in MDM2 amplified GBM
Aim 2: Define the effects of brigimadlin on cellular response to genotoxic stress
Aim 3: Evaluate strategies to enhance the therapeutic window for MDM2 inhibitors in GBM"

 Despite proven benefits, many patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are not
prescribed life-saving, guideline-recommended medications. This gap in prescribing occurs in up to 75% of
eligible patients, leading to an estimated 68,000 preventable deaths per year nationwide. Moreover, patients
often do not consistently adhere to these life-saving medications up to 60% of the time. A major reason for
these gaps in prescribing and adherence may due to be restrictive coverage policies, such as cost-sharing
(patients pay out of pocket through copayment or co-insurance), and prior authorization (providers required to
justify use of a medication before it is covered). These policies can have harmful effects when applied to life-
saving therapies. For example, high out-of-pocket costs can result in reduced medication adherence, or may
worsen inequities by differentially impacting vulnerable populations. Moreover, physicians are often unaware of
these policies’ existence or magnitude, and often do not discuss cost with their patients, despite the majority of
patients wanting their providers to initiate this conversation.
 We propose to utilize a large, integrated database combining publicly available insurance formulary
information, electronic health record (EHR) data, pharmacy data, and neighborhood-level census information.
In Aim 1, we will use this database to quantify the effects of restrictive drug coverage policies for guideline-
recommended HFrEF regimens on provider prescribing, patient adherence, and clinical outcomes. In Aim 2,
we will develop models to ascertain whether certain vulnerable subgroups of patients with HFrEF are at higher
risk of negative impacts of these policies. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use implementation science methodologies
to develop and pilot-test an EHR-embedded intervention that will identify patients at risk for coverage-related
barriers, and promote discussions between physicians and patients on cost-related barriers and alternatives.
 This proposal addresses the NHLBI strategic vision by investigating differences among populations,
optimizing implementation research, and leveraging opportunities in data science. Moreover, the proposed
research and training plan will advance Dr. Mukhopadhyay as an independent investigator in cardiovascular
health services research. Specifically, this proposal will allow her to develop proficiency in quasi-experimental
methods, master skills required for integrated population database analysis, acquire content expertise in health
equity research, and cultivate competency in implementation science methods. Dr. Mukhopadhyay’s
interdisciplinary mentorship team unites established investigators with expertise in large population database
analysis, advanced quasi-experimental methods, health equity research, implementation science, EHR-based
research, and cardiovascular medicine. This team will guide Dr. Mukhopadhyay towards her goal of becoming
an independent investigator committed to finding ways to reduce gaps and inequities in cardiovascular care."

Older adults diagnosed with ADRD are up to three Ɵmes more likely than cogniƟvely intact older adults to sustain a hip
fracture, and paƟents with ADRD have poorer funcƟonal outcomes, greater disability and dependency, and spend more
than 50 fewer days at home in the year aŌer fracture. However, this growing populaƟon is highly heterogeneous with
some paƟents experiencing very slow to very fast recovery, which precludes proacƟve risk straƟﬁcaƟon, hinders shared
decision making, and thwarts opƟmal transiƟonal care support. Given the signiﬁcant costs and consequences of hip
fractures among older adults, improving recovery trajectories for those with ADRD is a crucial naƟonal priority.
Unfortunately, clinical characterisƟcs and hospital-level factors associated with longitudinal post-fracture recovery in this
populaƟon are poorly understood, hindering the development of eﬀecƟve and personalized transiƟonal care strategies.
Moreover, hospitals oŌen obtain access to Medicare data and outcomes on their clinical populaƟons, but how eﬀecƟvely
they can use this data for quality improvement is in quesƟon, which reﬂects a major missed opportunity to both improve
and tailor care for older adults, parƟcularly those with ADRD. Untangling mulƟ-level variabiliƟes within the populaƟon of
paƟents with ADRD is criƟcal because they could be the target of more individualized caregiving strategies to promote
aging in place, facilitate resource allocaƟon among hospitals, and enable the advancement of precision healthcare. To
this end, we will develop, validate, and apply novel analyƟcal methods in data science, which include proposing machine-
learning assisted high-dimensional regression, computaƟonally eﬃcient individualized dynamic predicƟon, and mulƟ-
algorithm-based robust causal inference methods: Aim 1: Develop a novel machine learning-assisted method for
idenƟfying unique paƟent characterisƟcs leading to poor longitudinal recovery outcomes in geriatric seƫngs with mulƟ-
level structured data. Aim 2: Develop a novel joint modeling approach for mulƟ-level and mulƟ-variate outcomes:
uncovering shared mechanisms and facilitaƟng individualized dynamic outcome predicƟon. Aim 3: Develop a new
method of ML-algorithm ensemble to idenƟfy causal factors, as potenƟal target for health system-level and pragmaƟc
intervenƟons to enhance recovery outcomes. Aim 4: Leverage Medicare data from >20,000 paƟents treated by over 1000
hospitals to understand mulƟlevel variabiliƟes of post-fracture recovery outcomes for older adults living with ADRD. The
proposed method can eﬀecƟvely handle high dimensional data, address mulƟple biases due to informaƟve clustering at
mulƟple levels (healthcare facility, individual, observaƟon) and truncaƟon by death, and outperform exisƟng methods
and lead to unbiased analyses that disentangle mulƟ-level variability of post-fracture outcomes. Signiﬁcance is enhanced
by developing and releasing soŌware (e.g., R packages) to increase the methods’ uptake among the scienƟﬁc community.
The ulƟmate impact is to enable individualized predicƟon for older adults living with ADRD and promote Ɵmely strategies
to improve caregiving for detected high risk cohorts."

Hematopoiesis ensures the continuous formation and turnover of blood cells during homeostasis, which shifts
drastically towards production of inflammatory innate immune cells upon infection. At steady state, myeloid
progenitors express a default signaling pathway essential for monocyte/macrophage production and require
extrinsic signaling and transcription factors to direct lineage commitment towards other myeloid cell fates. During
infection, coordination of cytokines and growth factors shifts myelopoiesis dramatically towards neutrophilia, a
process known as emergency granulopoiesis. For instance, neutrophil production during systemic infection is
boosted by over 10-fold, increasing cell numbers to over 1012 in a single day. Therefore, the rapid response to
lineage-specific cytokines and growth factors to drastically increase granulocyte output is essential for pathogen
clearance and host survival. Inappropriate lineage fidelity is exemplified by aberrant responses to infection
observed in systemic inflammation and septic shock, however, the cellular machinery necessary to shift lineage
commitment to emergency neutropoiesis remain poorly understood. Recently, we made the surprising discovery
that the chloride-sensing kinase with-no-lysine 1 (WNK1) is indispensable for myeloid progenitor fate, with
myeloid-specific deletion of Wnk1 incurring dramatic loss of tissue-resident macrophages, disrupted organ
development, systemic neutrophilia, and mortality by 4 weeks old. Mechanistically, the cognate CSF1R cytokine,
macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), triggers macropinocytosis in myeloid progenitors, which in turn
induces phosphorylation and activation of WNK1. Absence of WNK1 or macropinocytosis inhibition drove
myeloid progenitor differentiation into granulocytes in vitro and in vivo. The goal of this proposal is to
mechanistically dissect the WNK1-dependent pathway initiated by M-CSF-induced macropinocytosis and to
investigate how this pathway is systematically shifted during emergency granulopoiesis.
During the mentored phase of this application, I will master new techniques such as subcellular fractionation and
macropinosome isolation. I will study how to analyze, integrate, and communicate complex functional genomics
and metabolomics data. Together with colleagues, we will develop new tools to assess the importance of
macropinocytosis during hematopoiesis in vivo, allowing us to understand how the contents of macropinosomes
inform myeloid lineage commitment. With the guidance of my mentoring committee, I will strengthen my scientific
and professional skillsets in preparation for the independent phase. During the independent phase, I will explore
targeting the WNK1 pathway during sepsis using small molecules. Further, I will combine my expertise in in vivo
sepsis models, emergency granulopoiesis, and neutrophil biology together with tools developed during the
mentored phase to understand how macropinocytosis influences the innate immune response. The proposed
project will allow me to successfully establish an independent academic research program."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a public health crisis that disproportionately affects individuals in the Black
community. With recent advances in treatment, the need for early identification of AD pathology has never
been greater. Early detection allows for early intervention which may be essential to slowing or stopping the
progression of AD prior to widespread, irreversible neuronal loss. Further, early disclosure of increased risk for
AD has been shown to motivate positive health behaviors and planning for long-term care. Blood-based
biomarkers have been developed to provide a first line screening for the presence of AD pathology. These
biomarkers, such as plasma levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 217 (p-tau217), have shown great
promise as accessible and accurate early indicators of AD pathology, yet these biomarkers have been
developed in predominantly White cohorts. Plasma biomarkers are affected by systemic health conditions such
as obesity and chronic kidney disease. These medical conditions disproportionately affect Black adults and
may affect the performance of blood-based biomarkers in the Black community. However, the effect of these
factors has not yet been quantified in cohorts that are representative of the population and no potential means
of ameliorating any racial differences in plasma p-tau217 performance has yet been investigated. We propose
to study the effect of the various sociodemographic and medical factors that disproportionately affect Black
adults on plasma p-tau217 levels in local, unique, diverse, and deeply phenotyped cohorts. We will first
quantify the impact of various sociodemographic and medical factors on plasma p-tau217 levels in 3500
individuals (2/3 Black) from the Southern Community Cohort Study. Next, the sociodemographic/medical
factors which significantly affected p-tau217 levels will be evaluated as mediators of the association between
p-tau217 and incident dementia to determine if these factors affect the predictive accuracy of this biomarker.
Finally, the effect of race on the association between p-tau217 and incident dementia will be investigated in the
Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project and Tennessee Alzheimer’s Project cohorts (estimated n=1300, 325
Black). Should racial differences exist, analyses will be repeated using the plasma p-tau217/amyloid-b42 ratio
as predictor to determine if using a ratio increases the predictive accuracy of p-tau217. This proposal will
provide excellent training opportunities in the epidemiology of AD, increase my understanding of the causes
and consequences of racial disparities in AD, expand my knowledge and technical expertise for utilizing
plasma biomarkers in AD, and provide the essential professional and leadership skills necessary to advance
my career as a productive clinician-scientist. These training goals will be accomplished with the aid of an
expert interdisciplinary mentorship team to ensure my success. The skills in AD epidemiology, biostatistics,
Medicare claims data analysis, and plasma biomarker analysis gained through this training plan will fuel my
future successful independent research program and establish me as a leader in the field of community-based
screening for AD and related dementias."

This is a renewal for a Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research (K24). The applicant, Dr.
Richard Souza, is a clinician-scientist, Professor in Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science at the University
of California, San Francisco. Throughout his career, Dr. Souza has built upon his clinical background through
detailed and comprehensive studies on the influence of loading mechanics on knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA).
These studies have used biomechanical methods such as motion capture systems, accelerometer-based activity
monitoring, and strength assessment through dynamometry, and have characterized disease status and
progression using advanced quantitative MRI metrics including T1ρ and T2 relaxation time mapping of knee and
hip cartilage. Combining his background in musculoskeletal biomechanics with the world-renowned research
team in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF, Dr. Souza has been able to uncover key
biomechanical variables that contribute to the earliest changes in the OA process. These efforts have resulted
in a series of R01 awards on joint mechanics in OA, including a recently funded MPI R01 on bone and cartilage
interaction in persons with patellofemoral joint OA (R01 AR079647). Understanding the predictive capability of
lower extremity joint biomechanics to identify disease progression has been the driving force of Dr. Souza’s
work. The team of investigators at UCSF in the Musculoskeletal Quantitative Imaging Research group, including
Drs. Sharmila Majumdar, Thomas Link, Daehyun Yoon, Galateia Kazakia, and numerous other have built a
collaborative infrastructure ripe for mentoring trainees with interest in the intersection of biomechanics and
quantitative imaging. The current application requests funding (50% salary support) for 5 years to support the
protected time necessary to conduct the proposed patient-oriented research and to expand opportunities for
mentoring within the UCSF community. This protected time will allow Dr. Souza to continue to lead a productive
research group and maintain minimal teaching and administrative responsibility at the Departmental and
University levels. Dr. Souza will also obtain additional training in [18]FDG PET MR analysis and tracer kinetics,
pain imaging, both peripherally and centrally, as well as participate in the Training in Clinical Research (TICR)
program. There are plentiful opportunities to expand the work Dr. Souza has begun, and extremely high potential
for clinical break-through in this important area of clinical research."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically complex and heterogeneous set of diseases characterized by a
diverse set of mutations. Although many patients initially respond to treatment, many end up relapsing. Over the
last decade, an appreciation of the genetic diversity and clonal hierarchy in AML has opened the door to novel
therapeutic targets and therapeutic approaches to specific AML subtypes. Moreover, AML has been found to
bear unique metabolic features with therapeutic implications. Most importantly, mutations in the enzymes
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) have led to clinically approved drugs. However, many patients become
resistant to this therapy as well, further underscoring the need for new strategies to target dysregulated
metabolism in leukemia. Through the development of novel microcoil platforms to explore leukemia metabolism
with HP MR (Jeong et al. Science Advances 2017) we have identified a new metabolic vulnerability in the
glycolytic metabolism of leukemia (Jeong et al. Cell Metabolism 2021). This reliance on glycolytic metabolism
alters not only glucose flux to lactate, but also one-carbon flux through the serine pathway, which facilitates the
metabolism of glutamine. Moreover, we found that genetically targeting or pharmacologically inhibiting the
enzyme that mediates flux through this pathway (PHGDH) capitalizes on a new vulnerability in these cells.
Importantly, this targeting does not affect normal hematopoietic cell growth. Thus, building upon extensive
collaboration between our labs and ample preliminary data, we aim to employ innovative approaches to study
metabolism (Keshari Lab), including by developing non-invasive probes to measure changes in glycolysis and
oxidative stress with hyperpolarized magnetic resonance imaging. This metabolism will be characterized in well-
defined models of AML (Kharas Lab), with both genetic and pharmacological modulation, in order to develop a
strategy to assess leukemia-stem-cell-driven AML metabolism and the inhibition of serine metabolism.
Altogether, these studies will result in new mechanistic insights and novel cancer therapies."

epigenetics and reproduction. The Center also features an Outreach program that has been in place for more
than 10 years; the Penn Academy of Reproductive Sciences uses hands on laboratory experiences and
interactive lectures to educate high school students, largely from the Philadelphia area schools, in the

interventions, an altered placental or cord blood epigenome, perinatal outcomes and childhood metabolic
health will be investigated. Project 2 (Bartolomei) will closely parallel Project 1 by using a validated mouse
model to study the effect of ART laboratory manipulations on epigenetic gene regulation and physiological
outcomes in conceptuses and adults. Project 2 will address the question of whether oocyte vitrification impacts
epigenetic gene regulation and placental morphology and will also determine if altered oxygen concentration
underlies adverse ART outcomes. Project 3 (Mainigi and Huh) will utilize a novel in vitro organ-on-a-chip

specifically, how sex chromosomes and sex steroids impact human trophoblast differentiation and invasion.
The project will also explore how specific interventions associated with ART lead to sexually dimorphic effects
in trophoblast behavior, the epigenome and the transcriptome. Project 4 (Wang) will examine the TEX15
protein, which is required for meiosis and male fertility, and is a novel epigenetic regulator essential for
retrotransposon silencing. This project will determine the epigenetic state associated with retrotransposon
activation in Tex15-deficient germ cells and also examine the novel function of TEX15 and its interacting
partner, TASOR2, in spermiogenesis. Finally, the project will model human male infertility using a unique
Tex15 revertant mosaic mouse model. PennCSER will not only provide training to clinicians, physician

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
21-100. The proposal herein outlines a 3-year career development plan with the overarching scientific goal of
making active surveillance (AS) safe for men with low-grade prostate cancers who have inherited high genetic
risk for the disease. With this award, the candidate wants to build on her prior research and clinical experience
in AS and in prostate cancer germline genetics, with the guidance of her mentors Drs Daniel Lin, Heather Cheng
and Burcu Darst. This mentorship team has complementary expertise in AS, clinical management of inherited
high-risk prostate cancers and genetic epidemiology, which will allow her to study germline genetics in AS by
integrating three measures of inherited risk – high-risk family history, rare pathogenic mutation carrier status and
polygenic risk scores. The research plan, didactic courses and career development goals outlined in the proposal
are designed for the candidate to become an independent investigator and surgeon scientist with unique
expertise in the management of high-risk patients on AS.
 AS is the standard of care for low-grade prostate cancers, irrespective of inherited genetic risk, as many
of these cancers never need to be treated, and for those that do progress during surveillance, treatment can be
safely delayed without missing the window of opportunity for cure. Little is known however about optimal
management of men who inherit high genetic risk for prostate cancer after diagnosis of low-risk localized disease.
In the metastatic setting, certain germline variants are significant drivers of disease and are associated with poor
survival. Currently there is limited data on the role these same variants play in the biology of low-grade cancers.
Some studies suggest these patients can be safely monitored on AS and others suggest the opposite. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that most men who carry one or more measures of inherited risk can be
safely surveilled; and the tumor features of these patients can help in their risk stratification. This hypothesis will
be tested by pursing two specific aims: 1) Identify associations between the three measures of inherited risk and
outcomes during and after AS; and 2) Evaluate the tumor characteristics of the carriers of one or more measures
of inherited risk. In the first aim, associations between any combination of the three measures and upgrading
during surveillance or recurrence after delayed treatment will be evaluated. The second aim will serve to identify
tumor specific mutations, molecular alterations and histopathological patterns associated with AS outcomes in
low-grade tumors of men with high genetic risk. This is an innovative approach because it will take into account
all three measures of inherited risk and identify potential links between the germline and the tumor. The research
is significant because it will generate clinically actionable results allowing providers to better counsel their
patients with high genetic risk considering AS."

 It is estimated that up to 0.6% of the US population is transgender, which describes someone whose
gender identity is incompatible with their sex assigned at birth. Gender affirming medical care can include
vaginoplasty, which is the surgical creation of a vulva and neovagina. Transgender women have increased odds
of testing positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
compared to cisgender women, which is maintained after adjusting for high-risk behaviours, suggesting
biological factors unique to the neovaginal microenvironment may contribute to this increased risk. Despite this,
little is known about the neovaginal microenvironment, which could have important implications for both post-
operative care and long-term mucosal health of people with neovaginas.
 The neovaginal microbiome is not well-defined, but typically has greater microbial diversity compared to
the natal vaginal microbiome, and contains species that are more typically detected in the penile, intestinal and
skin microbiomes. In cisgender women vaginal microbial dysbiosis has been linked to increased genital
inflammation, gynecological symptoms, and an increased risk of acquisition of STIs including HIV, but it is
unknown if the neovaginal microbiome has a similar impact on gynecological health. A major gap in knowledge
is defining the optimal neovaginal microbiome, including an understanding of the colonization and stability,
and relationship to gynecological health, which is vital for care of people with neovaginas. Indeed, current
post-operative and long-term care recommendations differ greatly between surgical centers. In this proposal we
will define the neovaginal microbiome in transgender women who have undergone (“post-op”) or are scheduled
to undergo (“pre-op”) vaginoplasty, and investigate associations of the microbiome to genital inflammation and
clinical outcomes including gynecological symptoms.
 This study will be the first to comprehensively profile the neovaginal microenvironment, which is critical
to provide evidence-based care guidelines to people with neovaginas."

UniProt is one of the foundational resources for understanding the molecular details of the inner life of the cell.
As a hub for knowledge of protein sequence and function, UniProt organizes knowledge from biomedical
literature, integrates datasets with curated knowledge, and serves as an exemplar FAIR and TRUST resource
reused by hundreds of other data resources. The Common Fund (CF) program brings together diverse
collections of valuable biomedical data, yet still needs to be connected with the major data repositories
ecosystem to uncover its full potential for discovery and innovation. In this application we will strengthen the
protein-centric connectivity of UniProt to multiple CF Data Coordinating Centers (DCCs) and the Data Resource
Center (DRC) in the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE), and will collaborate with two CF DCCs, the
Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) and the Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Project of the Bridge to
Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Program. The collaboration will support CFDE data integration and reuse, while
building new capabilities to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and cell networks for deeper
understanding of responses to perturbations at the systems level. To foster biomedical discovery through the re-
use of CF data and enable novel scientific research that was not possible before, we will increase the connectivity
and data integration between UniProt and CF datasets. We will create a new form-based mechanism to link with
CF data resources, starting with several already identified for targeted integration. We will extend the UniProt
mapping service, allowing researchers to identify data of interest through protein-centric search and promote
interoperability at the protein level across the CF ecosystem. We will develop new tools, APIs and workflows
with easy access and navigation for researchers to interrogate and understand complex biological systems and
cell networks. It will allow seamless bidirectional navigation of data from whole subcellular systems to functional
pathways and interacting proteins and vice versa. We will hold annual workshops to broaden collaborations with
the CFDE and engagement with the research community. We will incorporate user feedback throughout the tool
development lifecycle and implement an integration plan with the CFDE for dissemination and long-term
sustainability. We aim to understand systems-level responses to perturbations through genotype-phenotype
mapping and metabolic and signaling network discovery. We will integrate relevant datasets, tools, and literature
and extend our knowledge graph learning algorithm for link prediction in a drug discovery use case. We will build
customized knowledge graphs with various use scenarios, incorporating scientific questions from the
demonstration project and user engagement. This UniProt-CF partnership will support functional genomics
towards fundamental biological systems understanding and the development of new diagnostics and therapies."
10981279,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Degradative pathways maintain protein homeostasis and set signaling
duration for endosomal receptors. Dendritic vesicle transport is needed for initially enabling dendrite elaboration
in development and later promoting postsynaptic functions of neurons. Dendrites can reach considerable lengths
and thus have to solve the “distance problem”: biosynthetic capacity and degradative capacity are highest in/near
the soma. Our goal is to find novel regulatory mechanisms governing dendritic proteostasis. Our previous work
showed that directional transport is needed for Rab7-mediated bulk degradation of dendritic cargos. Using the
short-lived receptors NSG1/2 as “degradation sensors”, we can tackle the molecular mechanisms regulating
directional dendritic transport. Rab7 is a well-known regulator of LEs and lysosomes and genetically linked to
CMT2B. In fibroblasts, Rab7 is implicated in many distinct steps including endosome maturation, recruitment of
retromer for retrieving receptors, and recruitment of motors for regulating endosome positioning. It does so via
several effectors, many of whom are linked to human diseases. We will unravel the Rab7 effector hierarchy for
two important Rab7 effectors, RILP and Vps35. Vps35 is part of the retromer complex and retrieves multiple
cargos from late endosomes to escape degradation whereas RILP recruits dynein to late endosomes for
transport to somatic lysosomes. Our data indicate that extrapolating from studies in fibroblasts is insufficient.
Hypothesis: Rab7 “effector conversion” from Rab7-Vps35 complexes (promoting retrieval) and Rab7-RILP
complexes (promoting degradation) regulates organelle positioning, degradative flux, and signaling duration of
BDNF/TrkB from signaling endosomes in dendrites to change dendrite growth.
Strategy: We have discovered distinct Rab7-dependent phenotypes that can be rescued with WT Rab7.
We are using effector-skewed, phospho-, and CMT2B Rab7 mutants to dissect the steps at which Rab7
complexes function. These mutants will be used to test for “effector binding skew” as well as probe the functional
consequences of Rab7 mutants in dendritic proteostasis (Aim 1) and BDNF-mediated dendrite growth (Aim 2).
Impact: Completion of Aim 1 will advance our mechanistic, molecular understanding of where and when Rab7
effector complexes assemble to set the balance between retrieval and degradation along dendrites. Completion
of Aim 2 will link BDNF-mediated dendrite growth with regulation of sorting and trafficking (“endosomal fate
decisions”) via Rab7 effector cascades in dendrites. This will lead to a molecular understanding of how signal
duration and functional outcomes can be regulated by Rab7 effector conversion to skew receptor fate for faster
or slower degradation. This work will illuminate the cell biological mechanisms underlying signaling regulation of
a critical neuronal protein, BDNF, which has many roles in developing and adult nervous systems. Discovering
the molecular mechanisms by which early Rab7 complexes and late Rab7 complexes affect dendrite growth will
serve to identify critical nodes as potential therapeutic targets in disease states."

Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a thick peptidoglycan cell wall that is covalently affixed with a diverse
array of macromolecules that maintain cell integrity and promote effective interactions with the environment. In
clinically important bacterial pathogens, these macromolecules function as essential virulence factors. Our
research will investigate how bacteria elaborate their surfaces with adhesive pili and cell wall glycopolymers that
are critically important for microbial pathogenicity and growth. Both are attached to the same site on the cell
surface and their relative abundance is balanced to maintain homeostasis. We will study the prototypical SpaA-
pilus from Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of the severe respiratory disease, diphtheria. The
SpaA-pilus and related pili in >1,800 bacterial species are assembled by polymerases that covalently link pilus
protein subunits (pilins) via lysine-isopeptide bonds that confer enormous tensile strength. By synergistically
employing structural, biochemical, cellular, computational, and proteomic methods, we aim to learn how these
polymerases select and crosslink their pilin substrates to build pili. We will also determine the first-ever atomic
level structure of a crosslinked pilus and uncover the full array of pilus structures that inhabit the surface of C.
diphtheriae. In complementary studies, we seek to identify small molecules that selectively disrupt the synthesis
of glycopolymers that coexist with pili on the cell surface. Using a newly developed cell-based assay we will
screen for compounds that inhibit the synthesis of an important cell wall glycopolymer in methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These inhibitors have the potential to be developed into novel therapeutics as
they would impair MRSA's ability to cause infections and re-sensitize it to existing β-lactam antibiotics.
Combined, our comprehensive studies of pilus and cell wall glycopolymer biogenesis will provide fundamental
insight into the chemistry underlying polymer assembly on the surface of gram-positive bacteria and could lead
to new antibiotics to treat infections caused by MRSA and other drug-resistant bacteria."

Impaired urinary outflow that causes damage to the urinary tract and kidney is a major cause of kidney disease, which affects 15% of the population and costs $100B annually. For instance, hydronephrosis, a pressure mediated dilation and damage of the renal tissues, is the leading cause of pediatric kidney failure. Major gaps remain in our understanding of the causes that underlie impaired urinary outflow and urinary tract damage. For instance, approximately 50% of all urinary tract dilation occurs in the absence of a physical obstruction, yet the functional abnormalities causing these cases remain obscure. Indeed, the upper urinary tract (UUT) is a continuous muscular organ that contracts to propel waste from the kidney to the bladder. Defects in this peristaltic process, such as vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), or retrograde backward urine flow from the bladder to the kidney, are pathological. VUR affects 2% of children, and can lead to urinary tract infections, hydronephrosis, and chronic reflux nephropathy that leads to end-stage renal disease in 10-25% of cases. Despite the essential physiological role of the UUT, the mechanisms driving UUT peristalsis remained unknown. Our group discovered that HCN ion channels underlie UUT pacemaker activity, that HCN+ pacemakers co-express T-type Ca2+ channels that control contractile rate, and most recently, that the HCN+ pacemakers are evolutionarily conserved and drive peristalsis of the unique multicalyceal UUT exhibited by humans. To date, however, the role of pacemaker defects in functional urinary tract disorders remains elusive. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to provide a mechanistic framework of UUT physiology, as a critical step to developing diagnostics and drugs to treat conditions such as VUR and hydronephrosis. To fill the current knowledge gaps, we will use a novel mutant mouse model that exhibits UUTs that lack pacemakers, exhibit normal smooth muscle, and develop VUR and hydronephrosis. We will use this novel mouse model to define the pathophysiology of pacemaker defects that cause urinary dilations. In aim 1 we will define the transcriptional signaling mechanisms that are required for pacemaker formation and functional UUT peristalsis. In aim 2, we will define the transcriptional protein complexomes that assemble to control UUT pacemaker development. Notably, the transcriptional complexomes required for UUT formation remain a major knowledge gap in our understanding of the UUT. Taken together, the proposed studies will provide critical insight into functional peristaltic defects that impede urinary outflow, and results will generate new genetic and protein markers that can serve as putative targets for future diagnostics
and treatments for UUT pathologies, such as VUR and hydronephrosis."

2023) (1). BRD8 maintains malignancy by crippling p53-mediated tumor suppression in a way distinct from
previously described mechanisms: it reprograms the p53 network through the EP400 histone acetyltransferase
complex and by BD-directed occupancy of the histone variant H2AZ at p53-induced targets, enforcing a
repressive chromatin state that prevents p53-mediated transactivation. Central to this application is our finding
that targeting BRD8 in TP53WT GBM remodels chromatin by evicting H2AZ and enhancing chromatin
accessibility, enabling p53 to bind and transactivate its targets. This chromatin remodeling cascade (referred to
as the “BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch” in this proposal) re-establishes p53 activity in TP53WT GBM, normalizing
gene expression, evoking cell cycle arrest, inhibiting gliomagenesis, and prolonging survival in xenograft models
of TP53WT GBM (1). We advance this work by: (i) revealing that BRD8 opposes p53 function in non-malignant
brain cells; (ii) setting up a single-cell gene expression pipeline; (iii) showing that the BRD8 BD is the only BD
that selectively reprograms the p53 network; (iv) engineering a GBM-prone mouse model with intact p53 in which
we can ablate Brd8; and (v) establishing TP53WT GBM organoids from patients. The above findings support
the hypothesis that targeting BRD8 in TP53WT GBM evokes the BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch that re-
establishes p53-mediated tumor suppression. Despite these advances, how the BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch
works, and whether it will be useful for treating patients with TP53WT GBM, remain obscure. Therefore, the goal
of Aim 1 is to define the epigenetic mechanism by which targeting BRD8 re-establishes p53-mediated tumor
suppression in TP53WT GBM organoids. This will be accomplished by: (Aim 1.1) defining the set of genes
transactivated by the BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch at single-cell resolution and characterizing the genomic and
epigenomic features of these loci; (Aim 1.2) identifying pathways induced by the BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch
that facilitate p53-mediated cell cycle arrest; and (Aim 1.3) elucidating the dynamics of the BRD8/p53 epigenetic
switch and how it is modulated by EP400. The goal of Aim 2 is to demonstrate the preclinical relevance of
targeting BRD8 to re-establish p53-mediated tumor suppression in vivo. This will be accomplished by: (Aim 2.1)
assessing the effectiveness of targeting Brd8 in engineered GBM-prone mice; (Aim 2.2) establishing the
effectiveness of targeting BRD8 in patient-derived xenograft (PdX) models of TP53WT GBM; and (Aim 2.3)
evaluating the heterogeneity of p53-induced targets in single cells of GBM from spontaneous and PdX models
and defining the cell populations impacted by the BRD8/p53 epigenetic switch."
10981747,"ABSTRACT
Although immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has emerged as a powerful cancer
treatment, less than half of advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients have responded. There is
a crucial need for biomarkers to enable better prediction before ICI therapy and to overcome ICI resistance.
Among the contributing factors to ICI therapy resistance, the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor
microenvironment (TME) is one of the most challenging. Despite the important roles of both intratumoral
microbiota and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, there are huge gaps in linking specific tumor-residing microbiota
changes with immune cell subpopulations in NSCLCs treated with ICIs.
We hypothesize that an integrative prediction model that incorporates intratumoral microbiota and
immune predictors has the potential to substantially distinguish ICI responders from non-responders,
and improve the selection of patients that are most likely to benefit from ICI therapy. We propose to capitalize
on existing prospectively collected pre-ICI tumors or biopsies in ICI-treated NSCLCs from three cohorts (n =
500): Baylor College of Medicine cohort, Boston Lung Cancer Survival cohort, and Moffitt Cancer Center cohort.
Patients will be classified as ICI responders (defined as complete/partial response and stable disease) and non-
responders (defined as progression), using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(mRECIST) criteria. To identify new predictors that distinguish responders from non-responders before ICI
therapy, we propose the following three Specific Aims: 1) To identify intratumoral microbiome profiles predictive
of ICI response, using Whole-Metagenome Sequencing (WMS); 2) To characterize spatial immune signatures
predictive of ICI response, using single-cell Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC); and 3) To develop integrated
predictive models of ICI response incorporating clinical, microbial, and immunological data using deep learning
approaches.
Integration of tumor microbiome and its interactions with immune infiltrate within TME is a relatively new field of
investigation and challenging endeavor, which has not been reported in NSCLCs. This proposed study will build
upon archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimen repositories (pre-treatment tumor resection and core
biopsies), mature clinical treatment response and survival data from three independent cohorts, experience with
the proposed experimental microbiome and spatial immune profiling (WMS and IMC) approaches, institutional
core facilities, and the multidisciplinary research team, including cancer epidemiologists, immunologists,
microbiologists, oncologists and bioinformatics experts."
10981781,"Children’s Interstitial and Diffuse Lung Diseases (chILD) are disorders of the lung tissue that present in infancy
and early childhood. ChILD pose major burdens on thousands of children across the U.S., on their families, and
on the healthcare system more broadly. For most, the chILD-causing genes have not yet been identified and
current treatments are non-specific and are all too often ineffective. The long-term goal of this project is to define
the genetic landscape of chILD to inform the development of more specific and biologically rational therapies.
Our approach is informed by our implementation of two complementary approaches: (i) whole-exome
sequencing of patients seen in our chILD ambulatory clinics, which has to date established a genetic diagnosis
in 20% of cases, including discovery of 6 novel candidate chILD genes; and (ii) in situ gene expression profiling
of lung biopsy specimens, which we find differentiates samples with similar chILD histopathology based on their
underlying genetic causes, suggesting that patients with similar profiles may have forms of chILD caused by
shared molecular factors. In Aim 1, we will expand on these observations by profiling 300 available chILD lung
biopsy samples to define patient groups (clusters) with similar molecular profiles. A chILD molecular classifier
will be developed using 50 samples with definitive diagnoses and then validated in an independent set of 50
samples. The model will then be applied to 200 additional samples from patients lacking a molecular diagnosis
and assess the biologic significance of each cluster using gene set enrichment and rare variant genetic analyses.
We will assess clinical significance of cluster membership by testing for differences in clinical outcomes across
clusters. In Aim 2, we will analyze whole exome sequence data from a cohort of 400 children with unexplained
childhood parenchymal lung disease using family- and population-based methods to map new ChILD-causing
genes. To improve power, we apply integrative genomic and network-based analytic approach that incorporates
in situ transcriptomic data from Aim 1. We will replicate findings in the ChILD Research Network (ChILDRN)
registry and will evaluate the functional impact of candidate variants on target protein expression using patient-
derived biobanked samples. In Aim 3, to better understand how newly discovered ChILD genes contribute to
disease pathogenesis, and to characterize the spectrum of their clinical presentations, we will identify patients
harboring rare genetic variation in 6 novel chILD genes by screening the Genomic Information Commons (GIC)
database – an NIH-supported, federated infrastructure facilitating cross-institutional query of genotype–
phenotype databases at leading U.S. children’s hospitals. Children with these variants will be invited with their
parents to undergo standardized phenotypic assessments (clinical evaluations, biochemical analyses, and
molecular profiling) to characterize the spectrum of phenotypic consequences and inheritance patterns.
Ultimately, the findings from these studies will provide novel insights into the pathobiology of chILD and inform
the development of targeted therapies for these disorders."
10982391,"Wirelessly Powered Micro-Implantable Stimulation System for Intravascular Implantation
Over one million cardiac pacemakers are implanted every year worldwide, of which approximately 200,000 are
implanted in the United States (9). In the face of an aging population and increasing pacing indications, these
numbers continue to rise. Implantable pacemaker technologies have rapidly advanced since their initial inception
in the 1950s with the reduction in the generator size, increase in battery longevity, lead quality, and optimization
in pacing algorithms. Despite these advances, most of the pacemaker technologies rely on the transvenous
implanted leads for rhythm-control therapy. The potential complications and technical failures involving the lead
and the subcutaneous pocket, including lead displacement, cardiac tamponade, pneumothorax, lead fracture
and infection have remained (2). For these reasons, Medtronic released the first Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved leadless cardiac stimulation device via a minimally invasive delivery to the right ventricle (5, 6).
Despite the recent dual chamber implantation (7), the integrated battery introduces new clinical challenges such
as device implantation, perforation through the myocardium, and dislodgement. During the last funding cycle,
we ameliorated these potential complications by demonstrating the leadless and batter-free micro-pacer that
was implanted to the anterior cardiac vein (ACV) for restoring heart beats in the Yorkshire pigs (8). For the next
funding cycle, we seek to develop the smallest (2 mm x 10 mm), lightweight (5 mg), and flexible bioelectronics
that can be navigated in the tortuous cardiovascular anatomy to the ostium of coronary sinus for implantation
into ACV. We hereby propose to develop a soft battery-free and leadless microtubular pacer with enhanced
power transfer efficiency for intravascular deployment and implantation to the anterior vein. To test our
hypothesis, we have three aims: In Aim 1, we seek to demonstrate an integrated soft tubular pacer via the
radiofrequency (RF) receiving unit for myocardial stimulation. We plan to fabricate a tiny pacer harboring soft
mechanical properties and microtubular structure with the capacity to convert RF energy into electrical DC pulses
for cardiac stimulation. In Aim 2, we seek to demonstrate biocompatibility, flexibility, and stability at the electrical-
tissue interface. We will test the biocompatibility of the soft materials with human peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC), and we will evaluate the impedance of the vascular-electrode interface and power transfer
efficiency (PTE). In Aim 3, we seek to demonstrate a catheter-assisted deployment of the flexible microtubular
pacer to the anterior cardiac vein in a swine model for optimal inductive power transfer from the external
transmitter to the internal receiver at RF of 1 MHz. Overall, advances in micro-electronics hold promises for the
smallest volume and light-weight for battery-free and leadless electrotherapy without compromising PTE. The
minimally invasive technologies allows for navigation in the tortuous vasculature, with translational implication
for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, neurological, and urological applications."

The fundamental physical properties of the outer tunic of the eye determine the structural characteristics of the
ocular globe and may be altered in several devastating disease states, including axial elongation in myopia,
pathological deformation in keratoconus, and iatrogenic keratoectasia following corneal refractive surgery. These
biomechanical tissue characteristics not only influence our clinical interpretation of diagnostic tests, e.g.,
intraocular pressure measurement, but have been implicated as important factors in the development of
glaucoma. In our previous studies, we have developed a new method to perform quantitative measurements of
corneal elasticity in vivo in healthy and diseased eyes. Here, we will develop a next-generation method for the
assessment of corneal viscoelasticity in 3D with high resolution, no contact, and in real-time that could potentially
be used for routine clinical diagnosis and treatment. This method will take advantage of the interference of
multiple mechanical waves and ultra-sensitive detection and analysis of the interfering waves in 3D throughout
the cornea. Ultra-fast optical coherence tomography imaging and a new method for correcting for the loss in
temporal and spatial coherence will enable 3D mechanical imaging within milliseconds, which is not possible
with any existing methods. Our previous work has made fundamental advances in understanding corneal
biomechanics through a novel approach with potentially impactful applications in other disciplines (e.g., cataract
surgery, LASIK, corneal cross-linking (CXL), and tissue transplants with personalized treatments). The proposed
studies will accelerate the transition of this technology into clinics, influence our selection and application of
corneal surgical treatments, and help us understand the structural consequences of corneal disease and wound
healing."

We will conduct innovative linkages between our state cancer registry, all-payer claims data, and mental health
treatment sources from the South Carolina Integrated Data Warehouse to create a population-based, diverse
cohort of cancer patients (including < 65 years of age) that will allow us to comprehensively examine
disparities in novel targeted therapies, the joint and individual effects of treatment and co-morbidities, and
multi-level contributors across multiple domains to cancer survival trajectories. While we have made significant
improvements in cancer prevention and control since the 1950’s, we have failed in our attempts to narrow the
gap of cancer disparities experienced by minority and rural peoples. In our state with higher African American
(AAs; 28%) and rural (34%) representation, we have previously documented excess mortality of 60 to 75% for
African Americans (AA) compared to whites. Furthermore, a comprehensive (including diagnosis and all
treatment courses) and national cancer surveillance system that includes younger cancer survivors (< 65 years
of age) is completely impossible in our current cancer registry infrastructure. Consequently, the goal of this
investigation is to examine novel targeted therapies, effects of co-morbidities, and modifiable, multi-level
contributors to AA treatment outcomes, survival trajectories, and disparities. To achieve this goal, we propose
the following specific aims: 1) describe and compare patterns of novel targeted therapies for lung and colon
cancer by race, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural designation and their impact on survival disparities, 2)
describe and compare the individual and joint effects of cancer treatment and outcomes for concurrent co-
morbid diseases (CVD, diabetes, depression, and opioid use disorder) in a population-based cohort of lung
and colon cancer survivors by race, socioeconomic status, and urban/rural designation and their impact on
survival trajectories, 3) applying geospatial approaches within the context of NIMHD’s Research Framework for
minority health, to examine multi-level and system-level contributors (biological, behavioral, socio-cultural,
environmental, physical environment, and health systems) to racial, socio-economic, and rural survival
disparities for lung and colon cancer survivors to identify modifiable targets for intervention, and 4) disseminate
and translate our research findings into multiple levels of cancer care and among a diverse community of
stakeholders. Through the extensive networks and community partners previously established by this
outstanding, inter-disciplinary research team, we will partner with our community advisory panel to interpret
and disseminate these findings throughout professional and lay communities in order to identify targets for
future intervention at the individual, community, and policy level. The SC-Midlands Chapter of the American
Cancer Society and South Carolina Cancer Alliance will be key partners in our dissemination efforts. In this
way, our application is poised to make a significant impact on cancer health disparities."
10985783,"SUMMARY
The prevalence of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is
socially patterned, with populations of lower socioeconomic status being disproportionately burdened
by these conditions. While there has been much research examining the contribution of education to
cognitive decline and ADRD risk, comparably less research has focused on income as a risk factor for
cognitive decline and ADRD. Even less research has examined the association of income over the
lifecourse with these outcomes. This is because most cohorts with an explicit focus on aging and age-
related outcomes recruit participants in mid or late life. In addition, the paucity of research may be due
to indicators of material wealth, such as income, being difficult to correctly measure and track over time.
The parent grant addresses this research gap by using an innovative data pooling method to create a
synthetic cohort. The synthetic cohort combines data from eight different cohort studies that, together,
span the lifecourse. However, the parent grant’s pooling method is yet to be validated with real-world
data. Furthermore, much of the research examining income’s contribution to cognition has utilized self-
reported income, which may be subject to inaccurate recall. In this diversity supplement, we will use
Social Security Administration (SSA) income data that is linked to Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
participants to validate the lifecourse income measures generated from the parent grant’s pooling
method. The SSA data will provide us with valid and accurate adulthood to retirement income data for
HRS participants, while the synthetic cohort will pool self-reported income data from the HRS (cohort
with income data from mid to late life) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY; cohort
with income data earlier in life). Our specific aims are to: (1) Compare HRS participants’ actual and
accurate income data from the SSA to self-reported income data pooled across NLSY and HRS
to cover early adulthood to retirement ages, and (2) Examine the relationship of income
trajectories from adulthood to retirement with cognition, dementia and all-cause mortality using
HRS-SSA linked data and, separately, pooled income data from the NLSY and HRS. This project
will be doubly informative: validation of the parent grant’s pooling method will inform future approaches
to lifecourse research for ADRD as well as other disease areas; additionally, the outcome analysis will
robustly examine the association of lifecourse income trajectories with ADRD. Moreover, this project
will provide the applicant with training in social epidemiology, causal inference, and data pooling as
these areas related to ADRD research, which will increase his research capability and enhance diversity
in the field of aging research."
10985068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of my NS-supported research program is to understand the mechanisms that
stabilize the function of central nervous system (CNS) microcircuits during experience-
dependent plasticity and learning. Over the past ~20 years of NS support we discovered and
characterized several forms of homeostatic plasticity, including synaptic scaling and intrinsic
homeostatic plasticity, that are postulated to sense perturbations in mean neuronal activity,
then bidirectionally adjust synaptic and cellular properties to keep activity within a set point
range. Our recent work has focused on a) identifying the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
these homeostatic forms of plasticity in order to bolster our mechanistic and functional
understanding, and to generate tools that allow us to selectively block homeostatic plasticity in
vivo; and b) to determine what aspect of neuronal activity is under homeostatic control in intact
CNS circuits in vivo. We recently showed that the mean firing rates of neocortical pyramidal
neurons in freely behaving animals return back to an individual baseline following prolonged
perturbations to sensory drive, strongly supporting the idea that neocortical neurons
homeostatically regulate their mean firing around an individual `firing rate set point'. Such a
process is theoretically important for preventing circuit hypo- or hyperexcitablity during
experience-dependent development, as well as to short-circuit the positive feedback nature of
Hebbian plasticity rules that can degrade memory fidelity. We now have (or are developing) the
tools to disrupt homeostatic plasticity and firing rate set points in vivo, allowing us to assess the
impact of this disruption on network function and memory storage. The major goals of my NS-
supported research program going forward are: 1) to determine how activity set points are built,
and how individual neurons can have set points that are orders of magnitude different from each
other; 2) to understand how multiple homeostatic mechanisms cooperate with each other to
stabilize network activity in the face of profound perturbations; and 3) to test the role of
synaptic scaling and intrinsic homeostatic plasticity in memory encoding and generalization.
These studies will have important implications for our understanding of neurological disorders
that arise from aberrant circuit excitability (epilepsy, autism-spectrum disorders). They may
also provide a new avenue into understanding disorders such as PTSD that are likely to arise
from excessive generalization during aversive learning."
10985081,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death in the Western world despite significant
advances in early detection and extensive use of lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive drugs. To date, no single
drug has been developed to target the primary disease process in the vessel wall. A complete understanding
of the disease susceptibility is urgently needed to develop additional therapies. Common forms of
atherosclerosis involve environmental factors, hundreds of genetic variations, and their interactions, each of
which exert a relatively small effect on disease susceptibility. The most recent genome-wide association study
(GWAS) in nearly six hundred fifty thousand individuals identified 175 independent variants associated with
increased risk for CAD. However, most of the underlying genes and the related mechanisms of how these
variants contribute to the disease process remain unknown. This proposal outlines an integrative genetics
study in a unique resource of human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) isolated from 151 genotyped multi-
ethnic heart transplant donors to discover the CAD-associated variants that perturb SMC gene expression and
their downstream functional consequences. In recent studies, we measured gene expression in quiescent and
proliferative culture conditions representing the transdifferentiation of SMCs from a healthy to an atherogenic
phenotype. We identified 84 genes whose expression was associated with CAD variants in GWAS loci.
However, the causal genetic variants in these loci remain to be elucidated. Therefore, as part of the proposed
studies, we will first perform massively parallel reporter assays to identify the variants that modulate gene
expression in SMCs. We will also take advantage of the natural variation in gene expression to construct co-
expression and Bayesian networks to understand how the predicted candidate causal genes function in SMCs.
We will refine these networks by mapping regulatory elements to nascent RNA transcripts in response to pro-
inflammatory cytokines. We will then validate our predictions in gain and loss-of-function experiments in
cultured SMCs. We will also validate our predictions in well-phenotyped coronary artery specimens from cases
of unexpected sudden death by performing immunohistochemical analysis of proteins encoded by genes that
are predicted to play a key role in atherosclerosis-relevant SMC phenotypes. The overall goal of the proposed
studies is to integrate systems genetics and computational biology leading to mechanistic predictions of the
gene networks that are perturbed by CAD. Besides understanding CAD loci, these integrative genetics studies
will provide a useful window into the flow of biological information from genetic variants to SMC gene
expression and atherosclerosis-relevant phenotypes."

Cancer is the leading cause of death for Asian Americans, the fastest growing U.S. immigrant group projected
to outnumber Latinx Americans by 2065. Provision of high-quality supportive care for Asian American cancer
patients with metastatic disease is critically needed; however, there is a dearth of literature on this topic. Within
the Asian American population, Confucian-heritage East Asian and Southeast Asian ethnic groups share
cultural values and norms relevant to tailoring cancer care, and a goal of the K99 phase is to generate mixed-
methods data on supportive care needs specifically for Chinese-, Vietnamese-, and Korean-descent (CVK)
patients with metastatic cancer. Findings from the K99 phase will be shared with research participants and
applied collaboratively to develop culturally relevant supportive care interventions/resources in the R00 phase.
The overall training objective of this Early K99/R00 is to provide Dr. Kim with additional years of mentorship to
become a highly qualified independent investigator at the intersection of culture and supportive oncology.
Training goals include developing competencies in: 1) patient/family-centered and stakeholder-engaged cancer
care research, 2) patient-reported outcomes, needs, and preferences in metastatic cancer, 3) advanced mixed-
methods research particularly for working with non-English speaking participants, and 4) psychosocial
intervention development in cancer. Through the proposed training, Dr. Kim's background knowledge (in
qualitative and quantitative research, culturally grounded research in Asian American populations, and cancer-
related coping processes) will be integrated to solidify expertise in mixed methods and cultural implications for
psychosocial/behavioral cancer control as she transitions into an independent faculty position. The proposed
research will also document reflections about the experience of collaborative research for developing future
guidelines on inclusive research practices that promote advocacy. Dr. Kim's long-term plan is to develop, test,
and disseminate supportive care resources and interventions that are culturally relevant and scalable, toward
the ultimate goals of facilitating quality care and improving outcomes in understudied populations with
metastatic cancer."
10993281,"Title: Development of novel nanotherapeutics to overcome therapy resistance using canine brain tumor
as a spontaneous model
Project Summary/Abstract
High-grade gliomas (HGGs), including glioblastoma (GBM), are uniformly fatal primary brain tumors. Despite
decades of research, there have been almost no regulatory drug approvals for treatment of GBM in the United
States since bevacizumab in 2009. The lack of therapeutic advancement highlights therapeutic resistance of
HGG and the dependency on preclinical rodent models that do not faithfully recapitulate the heterogeneity and
complexity of human tumors. To address these unmet needs, the goal of this application is to develop novel
nanotherapeutics to overcome therapy resistance using companion dogs with HGG as a spontaneous model.
The current standard-of-care therapies for primary or recurrent HGG cause autophagy induction and result in
cell resistance and enhancement of stemness features. Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) have been linked to tumor
recurrence and drug resistance. Enrichment of GSCs after chemotherapy is associated with more aggressive
tumor rebound. Glioma cells, particularly GSCs, highly rely on elevated autophagy. Therefore, autophagy is a
promising target in HGG to improve treatment and overcome therapy resistance. Aminoquinoline drugs,
chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), have been tested in several clinical trials as autophagy inhibitors
and demonstrated their positive effect in improvement of median survival of patients after radiation/temozolomide
treatments. However, CQ/HCQ suffers from limited potency in inhibiting autophagy, adverse effects at
therapeutic dose level, and non-specific delivery profiles. Furthermore, the blood-brain barrier/blood-brain tumor
barrier (BBB/BBTB) poses a unique challenge for successful therapeutic delivery to brain tumors. Recently, we
have developed a series of novel bisaminoquinoline derivatives (BAQD) by pharmacophore hybridization
approach. BAQDs have outstanding autophagy inhibiting- and lysosomal disrupting- capabilities and are 30-50
times more potent than CQ and HCQ. The lead BAQD is undergoing IND submission (#165331) for first-in-
human clinical trials in 2024. We also developed novel BBB/BBTB-traversing and tumor-penetrating
nanoparticles (BTNs) to significantly improve the drug delivery to brain tumors. In this proposal, we plan to 1)
develop a series of BAQD loaded BTNs (BTN@BAQD) and investigate their effect in reversing drug resistance
and cancer stemness in HGGs, 2) evaluate their delivery efficiency and antitumor efficacy in orthotopic glioma
rodent models, and 3) ultimately determine the pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicity, tumor uptake and therapeutic
response of selected BTN@BAQD in dogs with spontaneous HGG. SN-38, a highly potent metabolite of
irinotecan will be co-loaded into BTN@BAQD to kill bulk glioma cells. We anticipate that our BAQD loaded
nanoparticles can efficaciously improve the treatment of brain tumor through effective autophagy inhibition by
potent BAQD and efficient delivery of high concentrations of drugs to gliomas by our unique BTN strategy,
respectively. Our team’s expertise in cGMP nanoparticle production and successful experience in moving a
nanoformulation into clinical trials (NCT05519241) will facilitate the clinical translation of the BTN@BAQD."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the pathogenic bacteria which causes tuberculosis (TB) disease and was
responsible for 1.6 million deaths worldwide in 2021. It is well-established through human and animal studies
that alpha-beta (αβ) T cells are important for the control of Mtb infection, but the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells
is less well-defined. γδ T cells express T cell receptor (TCR) heterodimers comprised of a γ-chain and δ-chain
that mediate recognition of a variety of lipids or small molecules presented by major histocompatibility-like
ligands, such as cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) or butyrophilin molecules. There is growing evidence that γδ T
cells are important in the early protective immune response against Mtb in the lung. The central hypothesis of
this application is that γδ T cells contribute to control of Mtb infection through recognition of mycobacterial lipids
and promotion of an enhanced adaptive immune response. A subset of γδ T cells, termed Vδ1 cells, are enriched
in tissue and have known reactivity to mycobacterial lipids presented by CD1 molecules. In AIM 1 we will evaluate
the molecular mechanisms underlying Vδ1 T cell lipid antigen recognition through analysis of in vitro expanded
clones and computational analysis of lipid-specific Vδ1 TCR motifs. By investigating specific TCR motifs
governing recognition of mycobacterial lipids by Vδ1 T cells, we will determine shared TCR characteristics that
will enable their identification in clinical cohorts. A major challenge to the field has been the lack of a suitable
animal model to understand the role of γδ T cells in mediating protective immunity to Mtb. We will develop a
novel in vitro granuloma model using the palatine tonsil, a readily accessible human mucosal tissue, and
investigate the role of γδ T cells in mechanisms of bacterial control. Our preliminary data reveal that the tonsil
contains γδ T cell subsets which respond to in vitro mycobacterial infection and specialized dendritic cells subsets
that can prime T cell responses. Thus, in AIM 2 we will use tonsil cells to study γδ T cell interactions with dendritic
cells in response to mycobacterial infection and develop an in vitro granuloma model and investigate the role of
γδ T cells in granuloma organization. A tractable tonsil-based in vitro granuloma system will be an important
contribution to the field and provides a unique system to interrogate the function of γδ T cells in response to Mtb.
Together, our proposal will lead to increased understanding of γδ T cells and profile their involvement in the
protective immune response to mycobacteria."
10995164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that affects nearly 3 million people. MS manifests when the
immune system attacks myelin, the insulating sheath around nerve fibers, and myelin producing cells in the
central nervous system (CNS). As a result, MS patients suffer from motor, sensory and cognitive deficits. The
most common form of MS, relapse-remitting MS (RRMS), is characterized by repetitive cycles of disease and
recovery. Tragically, if left untreated, two-thirds of RRMS patients progress to secondary progressive MS
(SPMS), characterized by continuous disease progression and irreparable CNS damage. To date, the cause of
MS is unclear and there is no cure. To identify potential targets for therapeutic interventions, it is critical to define
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying MS disease progression.
Microglia, long-lived CNS immune cells, have been shown to respond to disease by altering their morphology
and gene activity. Preliminary data have shown that this acquired disease-associated microglia (DAM)
phenotype is responsible for clearing myelin debris to facilitate remyelination, indicating that DAM could be
harnessed to protect against MS progression. To understand the cellular programming underlying microglia
function in the context of MS, this project aims to both define the gene specific gene signature of DAM,
and define how the function of these cells is affected by repeated activation, such as occurs in relapse-
remitting MS. By revealing the mechanism and functional impact of microglia reactivation, this proposal will
directly address an outstanding question in the field about how long-term activation of microglia may contribute
to MS disease progression.
Importantly, microglia, and more specifically, the DAM phenotype appears in chronic neurodegenerative
diseases. Therefore, understanding the long-term changes of chronically activated microglia in this project can
provide new insights for other disease models in which microglia have been implicated. Upon completion of the
proposed project aims, this fellowship would have supported my technical and professional development.
Specifically, by completing this project, I would have developed independence in designing, executing, and
analyzing experiments to understand epigenetic reprograming of microglia, as well as learning to use a novel
model system for studying microglia activation. Additionally, I would have developed my oral and written scientific
communication skills. Ultimately, support from this fellowship will help me achieve my long-term goal of becoming
a tenured faculty member at an R1 institution."

Transfer RNA (tRNA) biogenesis is essential for determining the pool of tRNAs that set the translational state of
cells, and defects in the tRNA biogenesis machinery are associated with several types of neurodegenerative
diseases. While bulk tRNA-sequencing assays of tissues and cell cultures have revealed that tRNA expression
and modification are regulated in tissue and disease-specific manners, technology to date has hindered our
ability to define tRNA processing, expression, or modification changes in neurodevelopment and
neurodegeneration at the level of single cells, limiting important insight and therapeutic development. In this
application, we propose to develop and apply a novel tRNA sequencing method to stem cell derived
neurons and cerebral organoids to reveal complex tRNA processing and modification patterns at the
single cell level for the first time. We will utilize preexisting laboratory models to establish and optimize our
technology (Aim 1) before profiling cerebral organoids with pathogenic variants in CLP1 and isogenic controls
(Aim 2). These findings will reveal the complexity of tRNA processing and modification at unprecedented cellular
level resolution. In addition to neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration, our research will have broad impacts
on the study of tRNAs across all tissues, as it will be applicable to any frozen or fresh tissue source. Outside of
neurobiology, it will also benefit other fields such as cancer biology and virology where tRNA modulation is known
to be important."

The sensory-motor circuits are specialized neuronal networks that modulate movement. During development,
the proper circuit assembly is fundamental in performing coordinated muscle contraction. During early postnatal
development, mammals are heavily dependent on the intake of food. To achieve this, they rely on the suckling
ability which transitions into mastication behavior, led by orofacial muscle activity. However, the mechanism of
formation, maturation, and transition from suckling to mastication behaviors, fundamental to surviving adulthood,
are poorly understood. Importantly, dysfunction in these behaviors may lead to neurodegenerative disease. The
masseter muscle is the main jaw-closing muscle and is the main muscle implicated in maintaining the correct
nutrient intake. The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (MesV) is a group of primary sensory neurons within the
brainstem that innervates the masseter muscle, projecting to the corresponding motor neuron pool. Additionally,
a population of periodontal pressoreceptor somas is also located in the MesV. This particular characteristic could
be related to the modulation of the masseter muscle activity by periodontal pressoreceptors activation. I
hypothesize that the sensory-motor circuits controlling the masseter muscles during normal development are
modified in an age-dependent manner to transition from suckling to masticatory behavior and that periodontal
pressoreceptors participate in muscle activity modulation. This project aims to explore the mechanisms of
assembly and modulation of sensory-motor circuits during healthy development of the masseter muscle, and
how dysfunction in these two behaviors impacts the neurodevelopmental neurodegenerative disease, spinal
muscular atrophy (SMA). Unraveling the developmental mechanisms of sensory-motor circuit assembly and
function is fundamental to our understanding of the mechanisms causing the disease. Using genetic mouse
models, and retrograde tracing, I will map the orofacial sensory-motor circuit formation and maturation in normal
development. State of art behavioral assays and electrophysiological pair-recordings, will provide the
characterization of sensory-motor circuit activation in an aged-dependent manner. SMA is caused by the deletion
of the Survival Motor Neuron 1 gene, resulting in a deficiency of the SMN protein. SMA is the most important
cause of death in infants, and its hallmarks are selective motor neuron death, muscle atrophy, and impairment
of muscle movements. In SMA disease, clinical evidence as well as work from animal models show that the
nutrient intake is severely affected. I hypothesize that the masseter sensory-motor circuit is impaired in SMA,
resulting in dysfunctional suckling and masticatory behaviors. To understand these mechanisms, I will use a
well-established SMA animal model (SMNΔ7 mice), together with immunohistochemistry, and behavioral assays.
In sum, this project will provide important insights into the development and function of orofacial behaviors both
during healthy development and under neurodegenerative conditions."

The primary goal of the PCT-KUH: Pittsburgh Center for Training in Kidney, Urology and
Hematology program is to provide an intensive and structured research experience for both
physicians and non-physician trainees in order to foster the development of the skills needed to
pursue a successful career in investigative nephrology, benign urology and benign hematology.
The Pittsburgh region is uniquely equipped to bring together trainees, mentors and resources
from three major academic institutions. The primary goal of the Administrative Core is to provide
an integrated collaborative infrastructure and administrative support to unite trainees and mentors
from the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Allegheny Health Network with
a shared interest in training KUH researchers. It will also oversee program organization,
governance; facilitate collaboration and communication, as well as program evaluation and
continuous improvement. To accomplish these goals, we propose the following objectives:
Objective 1: To provide infrastructure support for creating an integrated, collaborative and
supportive learning environment for pre- and post-doctoral trainees across the core institutions in
Pittsburgh. Objective 2: To facilitate coordination and communication among the U2C cores and
the TL1 program. Objective 3: To promote collaboration with KUH U2C/TL1 programs nationally
and host one Annual Retreat for the national KUH U2C/TL1 community. Objective 4: To facilitate
rigorous, unbiased and independent program evaluation. The Administrative Core will facilitate
these goals by providing an organization structural including Research Training Executive
Committee, Diversity Committee, and Research Advisory Committee. An External Advisory
Committee will monitor the progress of our training program. An Evaluation Committee will
conduct evaluation of our mentors, trainees and program, and provide suggestions to enhance
overall program effectiveness and success."

As greater understanding of the important role that the human microbiome plays in human
health has unfolded it is increasingly recognized that there is a vast and uncharted group of
viruses that have direct and important inﬂuence on the composi�on, dynamics, and func�on of
these microbial communi�es, and thus on the health of the human host. Metagenome
sequencing eﬀorts and other high-throughput methodologies have opened the door to large-
scale cataloguing and characteriza�on of free-living viruses and prophage, which are resident in
their bacterial host genomes. However, the diversity and lack of knowledge about these viruses
hampers our ability to understand their poten�al impact. Illumina�ng the region outside of our
current knowledge, so-called ‘dark mater’, is necessary to be able to understand, monitor,
control, and u�lize virus-community interac�ons to promote human health.
We hypothesize that applica�on of established and newly developed pipelines using these and
other tools will allow vastly improved iden�ﬁca�on and characteriza�on of viral elements that
are impac�ng human microbiome dynamics, and that providing improved tools for visualizing
these predic�ons and the rela�onships between them will have a broad impact on the ﬁeld. To
address these gaps we will develop enhanced methods for detec�on of viral sequences using
graph assemblies, build a sequence- and structure-based pipeline for characteriza�on of
auxiliary genes carried by viruses, and provide novel and useful ways of visualizing this complex
informa�on to allow greater insight from researchers in the ﬁeld."

10996299,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During the aging process there is a loss of automaticity in balance and mobility, where the engagement of
cortical resources for balance control may interfere with older adults’ ability to perform cognitive and balance
behaviors simultaneously. Over the course of normal aging, there is a decline in cerebral blood flow that is
linked to impaired cognitive function in older adults. However, it remains unknown whether age-related
declines in cerebrovascular and nervous system function may interact to manifest as cognitive interference in
balance control that precipitate falls and clinical dementia. Further, older adults who carry the Apolipoprotein
E4 (APOE4) allele, the greatest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, show greater
cerebrovascular dysfunction compared to age-matched noncarriers, and display worse balance performance
under cognitive loading conditions, supporting the potential effect of individual genotype on the link between
cerebrovascular health and balance control with aging.
Using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure dynamic cortical activity during standing balance reactions,
the candidate’s recent fellowship findings provide an individualized framework of cortical engagement
strategies for balance control in older adults that is associated with distinct aspects of balance behavior and fall
risk, including cognitive interference in balance performance. Currently, a major scientific barrier to the clinical
translation of this research is the lack of understanding of the factors that influence individual-specific cortical
strategies for balance control with aging. Emerging evidence suggests cognitive impairment with aging may be
caused by dysfunctional cerebral blood flow, specifically characterized by impaired cerebrovascular regulation
under conditions of physiologic stress. Blunted cerebral blood flow response to an acute bout aerobic exercise,
an assessment method pioneered by Dr. Billinger (primary mentor) and her laboratory, appears to be an early
indicator of dysfunctional cerebrovascular regulation in preclinical older adult populations. The proposed
project will be the first to test the link between cerebrovascular regulation during an acute bout of aerobic
exercise, measured as cerebral blood flow velocity using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, and cortical
function during balance behavior with aging, measured with cognitive dual-task balance performance (Aim
1) and EEG measures of cortical activity during balance reactions (Aim 2). An Exploratory Aim will test whether
genetic APOE4 carrier status alters the relationship between cerebrovascular regulation and balance control in
older adults. The scientific knowledge gained from these studies would create an individualized framework for
understanding cardiovascular-nervous system interactions that may contribute to balance disability in older
adults. This framework would provide a foundation for the development of precision-medicine strategies for fall
prevention, particularly in individuals at high risk for Alzheimer’s disease and subsequent falls."

Large granular lymphocytic leukemia (LGLL) results from a clonal expansion of antigen-driven cytotoxic T
lymphocytes, or natural killer (NK) cells. LGLL is characterized by an inability to complete activation-induced cell
death (AICD), inflammatory cytokine production, autoimmune disease, and cytopenias (primarily neutropenia
and anemia). In the absence of molecularly targeted therapeutics, treatments include broad immunosuppressive
agents that exhibit slow and incomplete responses. We have identified recurrent somatic variants along with
changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, histone code, and DNA methylation to define the molecular
pathogenesis of LGLL. These efforts revealed molecular diversity among LGLL patients that parallels the
dramatic clinical heterogeneity of this disease. Common mutational events included a preponderance of somatic
activation mutations in STAT3 followed by mutation of multiple epigenetic modifier genes (TET2, DNMT3A,
KMT2D, SETD1B, KDM6A), with frequent co-occurrence of the two. This project will precisely define the
consequences of these identified molecular alterations and their impact on LGLL biology and function. In Aim 1,
we will use readouts of proliferation, STAT3 activation, cell signaling, cytokine profiling, and gene expression in
cell line models and primary patient and healthy donor samples to define and compare the impact of the most
frequently detected LGLL mutations. In Aim 2, we will study the consequences of the recurrent STAT3, TET2,
and DNMT3A mutations on T- and NK-cell DNA methylation. We will also define the impact of these mutations
on susceptibility to an epigenetic targeting agent that reduces DNA methylation. In Aim 3, we will use
computational analysis of single-cell multi-omic datasets to define key molecular events downstream of recurrent
somatic variants in both T- and NK-LGLL. We will identify differences in clonal structure, gene expression,
chromatin accessibility, cell-cell interaction, and active transcription factors and their targets between the
malignant cells and their normal counterparts, and between the major mutation groups in LGLL. Finally, we will
integrate our gene expression with other reference single-cell datasets of cytotoxic T-cell antiviral responses,
tumor infiltration, and cell therapy. Together, these aims will identify and characterize cell-type-specific functional
changes in LGLL of high translational relevance, leading to the identification of predictive markers of treatment
response and new targets for therapeutic intervention."

 We propose to investigate the role of the chromatin methyltransferase DOT1L in neuronal function and
determine how its disruption leads to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). Although the genetic causes of
NDDs are heterogeneous, a high proportion of causative mutations are within the genes that encode chromatin
regulators. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the histone proteins that organize the genome and control
gene expression. Chromatin regulating enzymes deposit a wide range of posttranslational modifications on
histones such as methylation, acetylation, and many others. Interestingly, recent advances have identified
mutations in the histone methyltransferase DOT1L in NDD patients with intellectual disability and
developmental delays. However, the mechanisms through which DOT1L functions in the brain remain largely
unknown. DOT1L is the sole methyltransferase of histone 3 lysine 79 where it deposits methylation marks
(H3K79me). Patient mutations are de novo, monoallelic, and cluster in the catalytic domain. Our preliminary
data indicate that they likely act as loss-of-function mutations and decrease methylation of H3K79. In addition,
we found that DOT1L and H3K79me increase during neuronal development and that DOT1L depletion affects
transcription of critical neuronal synaptic genes. Together, this work suggests that DOT1L plays a critical role
in neuronal development and function.
 We hypothesize that partial loss of DOT1L and H3K79me disrupt transcription leading to cognitive
deficits and changes in neuronal maturation and synaptic gene expression. To test this, we will bring together
biochemical studies, genome-wide sequencing, and new cell and mouse lines to generate a model of the
patient disorder and define the function of H3K79me in neurons. Merging new systems with a wide range of
approaches has the potential to define how DOT1L affects cognition. We will first employ a heterozygous Dot1l
knockout mouse model to examine how partial loss of DOT1L affects chromatin, transcription, neurogenesis,
neuronal maturation, and behavior to provide insights into the disorder. Next, we will focus on H3K79me using
a new mutant embryonic stem cell line that allows us to specifically examine the effects of H3K79me in
differentiated neurons without perturbing other functions of DOT1L. We will use this stem cell model to
measure H3K79me genomic localization during neuronal development and determine how H3K79me loss
affects transcription and neuronal differentiation. By merging these diverse approaches, we will expand our
understanding of both an emerging disorder and the role and regulation of H3K79me in neurons. In addition,
these experiments will contribute to the broader understanding of how epigenetic regulators play a role in brain
function and how their disruption leads to neurodevelopmental disorders."

 Diffusion MRI (dMRI), with its sensitivity to neurological changes, has contributed immensely to our
understanding of the white matter structure at large-to-medium spatial scales, and more recently towards smaller
structures, particularly in the cortical and subcortical regions, as submillimeter dMRI is starting to become more
feasible. Nonetheless, further increase in resolution is required to move dMRI to the mesoscopic scale (100-
500µm), to improve sensitivity to small but important brain microstructural features and improve capability to e.g.
detect highly-localized tissue abnormalities such as focal cortical dysplasia and silent acute microinfarcts, as
well as enable study of brain connectivity across laminar structures and delineate functionally important small
sub-cortical gray matter structures. In this proposal, we aim to develop imaging technologies to allow mesoscale
dMRI and extend our development to enable mesoscale joint diffusion-relaxometry MRI with rich information, to
improve tractography’s robustness and enhance capability to extract detailed microstructural information.
Mesoscale dMRI and diffusion-relaxometry MRI will enhance the capability of many current clinical and
neuroscientific investigations and open doors to entirely new ones, facilitating new discoveries to deepen our
understanding of the human brain in both its healthy and diseased states.
 In the previous funding cycle, we developed the gSlider-SMS technology to allow 700-800µm dMRI to be
acquired in a short 20-minute timeframe and shared it across 26 research institutes world-wide, where it is being
used to investigate numerous neuroscientific questions and neurological disorders, including aging, epilepsy,
acute micro-infarcts, and deep-brain stimulation planning. For this renewal, we propose to create technologies
to allow 300-500µm whole-brain dMRI in 20-30 minutes, with fast reconstruction, suitable for wide-adoption. We
will then expand our development to create a joint T2-dMRI acquisition for fiber-specific microstructure imaging
and improved fiber tracking capability at the mesoscopic scale. Lastly, we will also create a highly efficient joint
T1-T2-dMRI acquisition, to rapidly collect large multidimensional data and provide diffusion-relaxation correlation
spectroscopic map per imaging voxel for detailed microstructural investigation. The multitude of imaging
technologies that we will develop will enable creation of new richer datasets that will have a significant and lasting
impact on the neuroscientific study of the human brain and many clinical applications. Optimized protocols will
be developed for high-end clinical 3T MRIs for wide deployment, and on high-performance head-only 3T MRIs
to enable neuroscientific explorations at the limit."

This renewal extends work accomplished during the previous award period and seeks to improve our ability to
characterize alcohol drinking through the measurement of blood levels of phosphatidylethanol (PEth).
Previously, we showed that: (a) PEth can detect recent alcohol consumption; (b) PEth levels are alcohol-dose
dependent; (c) PEth homologs have different rates of synthesis and elimination potentially useful in
differentiating recency of drinking; (d) there are no sex differences in PEth synthesis and elimination; and (e)
most importantly, there is substantial variability in PEth synthesis and elimination between people, even after
the same dose of alcohol is consumed. This variability raises significant concerns over current practices. PEth
is now accepted as a valid laboratory test for detecting recent alcohol use in forensic and legal court matters.
Distinct cut-offs of PEth levels have been adopted to indicate ""light or no consumption"", ""significant
consumption"", and ""heavy consumption"". Unfortunately, because there are significant differences in PEth
levels achieved in people given the same dose of alcohol, it could lead to misclassification of drinking. We now
propose to identify probable sources of variability in PEth levels and use biological/enzymatic variables to
develop equations to improve identification of alcohol consumption in the “real world”. We propose 3
experiments. An in vivo pharmacokinetic study that has 2 phases whereby participants consume 3 different
doses of alcohol and blood samples will be collected repeatedly during a 6-hour period to characterize blood
alcohol concentration and PEth synthesis. We will then characterize PEth elimination across a 10-day period
while remaining alcohol abstinent outside the lab. Second, alcohol-free blood collected from Aim 1 will be
examined ex vivo to characterize key biological variables (e.g., enzyme activity, red blood cell count, precursor
levels) involved in PEth synthesis and elimination. Equations will be used to evaluate these variables for their
ability to explain previously unexplained between-subject differences in the PEth levels formed after the same
amount of alcohol is consumed. Lastly, equations will be used to evaluate the value of using these
biological/enzyme variables to improve the prediction of 28-days of naturalistic drinking. Our Specific Aims
are to: examine the pharmacokinetics of blood alcohol and PEth synthesis/elimination following controlled
consumption of alcohol (Aim 1); identify key biological variables (e.g., enzyme activity, RBC count, and/or PEth
precursor levels) involved in PEth pharmacokinetics that can account for the previously unexplained between-
subject variance observed in vivo (Aim 2); and determine the use of PEth levels, with key biological variables
to identify drinking observed naturalistically. Study results will demonstrate that key biological variables can be
tested in clinical laboratory studies and found useful to enhance the prediction of recent drinking in a
community sample of heavy drinkers"

 Cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) communication is mediated through the integrins, a family of
heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to ECM ligands and modulate a wide range of cellular responses.
Although integrins have been implicated in regulation of inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis, their
involvement in post-infarction repair and remodeling remains poorly understood. Our proposal investigates for
the first time the cell-specific roles of integrin signaling in myocardial infarction (MI). Our preliminary data
demonstrate cell-specific roles of 5 integrin (ITGA5) in cardiac repair and post-infarction remodeling:
macrophage ITGA5 protects the infarcted heart stimulating angiogenesis, whereas fibroblast ITGA5 promotes
dysfunction accentuating myofibroblast infiltration in the infarct border zone. Moreover, V integrin (ITGAV)
is markedly upregulated in infarct macrophages and plays a central role in regulation of macrophage phenotype.
Accordingly, we hypothesize that macrophages and fibroblasts sense changes in the ECM composition of
the infarct through integrins, and activate cellular responses critical for repair, remodeling and fibrosis of
the infarcted heart. This hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims:
Aim 1: To dissect the mechanisms responsible for the protective effects of macrophage-specific ITGA5
signaling in the infarcted heart. We demonstrated that macrophage ITGA5 protects from adverse post-MI
remodeling through actions that may involve (in part) stimulation of an angiogenic macrophage phenotype.
Accordingly, we will dissect the mechanisms responsible for integrin-mediated activation of macrophages, and
we will examine the relation between integrin expression and macrophage heterogeneity in healing infarcts.
Aim 2: To study the role of fibroblast and myofibroblast ITGA5 in the infarcted and remodeling heart.
Our preliminary data show ITGA5 upregulation in activated fibroblasts and myofibroblasts infiltrating the infarct
and suggest that fibroblast-specific ITGA5 mediates dysfunction and adverse remodeling. Accordingly, we will
use cell-specific integrin KO mice and in vitro assays to explore the role of ITGA5 in regulation of fibroblast
phenotype and we will dissect the molecular cascades mediating ITGA5-stimulated responses.
Aim 3: To investigate the role of macrophage ITGAV in repair and remodeling of the infarcted heart and
to dissect ITGAV-dependent mechanisms of macrophage activation. Our preliminary data show that infarct
macrophages exhibit ITGAV upregulation and that ITGAV blockade modulates the fibrogenic profile of
macrophages. Accordingly, we will use myeloid cell- and inducible macrophage-specific ITGAV KO mice and
in vitro experiments to investigate the role of macrophage ITGAV in repair, remodeling and fibrosis of the
infarcted heart and to dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for ITGAV actions.
 The proposed studies will greatly contribute to our understanding of ECM:cell interactions in the infarcted
heart. Considering the availability of integrin inhibitors, our experiments have important therapeutic implications."

Despite similar obesity rates in both sexes, the underlying biology of excessive weight gain in women and men
is believed to differ significantly. Neurons in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) exhibit
sexually dimorphic characteristics and play a crucial role in energy balance. However, the signaling pathways
within VMH neurons that contribute to sex-specific control of energy balance remain largely unknown.
Recently, the primary cilium, a solitary antenna-like sensory organelle found in most mammalian cells,
including neurons, has emerged as a critical regulator of metabolic homeostasis. Human genetic studies have
identified the cilia-specific adenylate cyclase 3 (Adcy3) as a significant obesity-risk gene and animal studies
have further shown that global Adcy3 knockout mice develop severe obesity, particularly in females. However,
the mechanism underlying Adcy3's contribution to female-biased weight gain remains unknown. Our recent
findings indicate that selective deletion of Adcy3 in VMH neurons leads to female-specific obesity without a
significant increase in food intake. Adcy3 is enriched in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)- and melanocortin 4
receptor (Mc4r)-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of VMH (VMHvl), which are known to affect
energy expenditure (EE) in female mice. Additionally, we found that ERα binds to a putative promoter region of
the Adcy3 gene. Based on these compelling preliminary observations and previous literature suggesting that
Mc4r, a Gαs-coupled receptor enriched in primary cilia, is a direct transcriptional target of ERα within VMHvl
neurons and increases EE specifically in female mice, we propose a novel hypothesis that Adcy3 functions
downstream of ERα-driven Mc4r signaling at the primary cilium of VMHvl neurons to increase EE in females by
modulating the excitability and/or neurotransmission of these neurons. This hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing following three aims: Aim-1) determine if VMHvl Adcy3 is necessary for metabolic homeostasis by
acting downstream of estrogen-ERα and Mc4r signaling, Aim-2) determine if increasing Adcy3 activity in
VMHvl ERα+ neurons is sufficient to protect against obesity, and Aim-3) determine if loss of Adcy3 reduce the
excitability and/or the neurotransmitter release of VMHvl ERα+ neurons. The proposed research aims to
significantly advance our understanding of hypothalamic signaling pathways involved in sex-specific regulation
of energy homeostasis. Additionally, it will provide new insights into the largely unknown mechanisms by which
ciliary cAMP signaling affects the physiology of key hypothalamic neurons that are crucial for metabolic
homeostasis. Such knowledge may ultimately lead to the development of a novel strategy to effectively prevent
or treat obesity in females."
10982146,"Metastatic lung cancer kills >160,000 people in the US annually, and 10%-50% of patients with surgically
resected lung cancer will develop distant metastasis. There remains an unmet need to understand the tumor
genomics that drive metastases. SMARCA4 is the most frequently mutated member of the SWI/SNF complex in
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and its alterations are associated with development of metastatic disease.
Whereas SMARCA4 canonically acts as a chromatin remodeler, mechanistic investigations from our lab
reveal a noncanonical ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway involved in loss-of-SMARCA4–mediated
transcriptional regulation and metastasis in LUAD. Specifically, knockdown of SMARCA4 in LUAD cells
increases invasion and metastases. Increased SMARCA2 upregulates ROR2 and inhibition of ROR2 abrogates
invasion and metastasis of SMARCA4-deficient LUAD. Moreover, ROR2 increases the abundance of
transcription factor C/EBPa by inactivation of nuclear GSK3b. Using a GSK3β inhibitor, we rescued invasion of
SMARCA4KD/ROR2KD cells. Our overarching goals are 1) to elucidate the mechanisms through which
SMARCA4-deficient LUAD regulates transcription and promotes metastases and 2) to determine the role of
ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway in metastasis of SMARCA4-deficient LUAD. Two specific aims will test our
hypotheses. Aim 1: Investigate the mechanisms through which deficiency of SMARCA4 promotes metastasis of
LUAD. We will perform RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and selected reaction monitoring–mass spectrometry
using LUAD SMARCA4dTAG cells to measure gene transcription and chromatin accessibility and to quantify
transcription factors in real time. An in vivo CRISPR/sgRNA screen will be performed to identify functional
downstream transcription factors of ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway. Next, we will use mass spectrometry and
immunoFISH to decode the mechanism(s) through which SMARCA2 upregulates ROR2 in SMARCA4-deficient
LUAD and to explore alternative target(s) to suppress metastases. Aim 2: Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
targeting ROR2 to suppress metastasis in SMARCA4-deficient LUAD. We will assess the clinical relevance of
ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway in SMARCA4-altered LUAD by leveraging our clinically annotated biorepository of
>2000 human LUAD specimens. We will then use our LUAD patient-derived organoid model to examine the
requirement for p-GSK3βS9 for metastases of SMARCA4-altered LUAD and to test whether pharmacologic
inhibition of ROR2 using an antibody-drug conjugate currently in clinical trials decreases metastases in
SMARCA4-deficient LUAD. Finally, using a published KrasLSL-G12D/Trp53fl/fl/Smarca4fl/fl genetically engineered
mouse model, we will investigate the cell-specific dependency of ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway. Impact: Our work
will provide mechanistic and translational evidence that will highlight deficiency of SMARCA4 as an important
metastatic driver in LUAD through ROR2/p-GSK3βS9 pathway and will provide an important preclinical
justification for future clinical trials targeting ROR2 in SMARCA4-deficient LUAD to decrease metastasis."
10985934,"Force is transmitted from muscle to tendon across a specialized interface called the myotendinous junction
(MTJ). The MTJ consists of transmembrane, intercellular and extracellular proteins that connect muscle to the
cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) of tendon. The ECM is a 3D network of macromolecules that forms a
continuum integrating muscle and tendon, facilitating the seamless transmission of force. The interdigitating
interface of the MTJ is critical in force transmission from muscle to tendon and is hypothesized to reduce stress;
nevertheless, MTJ injuries can arise from diverse events, including physical work, sports and trauma, which
typically occur due to excessive eccentric force. Challenges in the clinical translation of engineering technologies
targeted toward the muscle-tendon interface arise from the difficulty in integrating two disparate tissues to form
a seamless MTJ. The objective of this proposal is to identify the role of the ECM and mechanical loading in
establishing and maintaining the strong linkage between muscle and tendon. This knowledge will be essential
for developing therapies to restore functionality to damaged MTJs.
 The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that the formation of a mechanically robust MTJ is dependent
on the integration of ECM secreted by both muscle and connective tissue cells at the interface and is maintained
by cyclic loading. We will test our hypothesis in two separate aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the cells and
reciprocal interactions that establish an MTJ-specific ECM. We will use cell-specific metabolic labeling and
proteomics to identify the components that muscle and connective tissue cells independently contribute to the
MTJ (Aim 1a). Since it is currently technically infeasible to target the expression of MTJ-specific proteins only at
the muscle-tendon interface in vivo, we will use in vitro co-cultures to investigate and perturb the reciprocal
signaling between myogenic and connective tissue cells (Aim 1b).
 In Aim 2, we will determine role of mechanical forces in creating and maintaining a functional MTJ. First, we
will directly investigate how embryonic motility affects development by using the muscular dysgenesis mouse
model in which muscle contraction is abrogated (Aim 2a). Then we will directly compare how unloading (hindlimb
suspension) and increased loading (treadmill training) affect the remodeling of ECM at the interface using
metabolic labeling and proteomics. Next, we will generate 3D muscle-tendon constructs based on fibrin gels and
cell-generated ECM (Aim 2b), since is not feasible to completely remove all mechanical forces in vivo. The
constructs will enable us to test the effect of unloading, and static and cyclic loading on MTJ formation.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will identify the extracellular parameters that establish and

functionality to damaged MTJs."
10990138,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Signaling through mTOR is a critical regulator of protein synthesis in the developing brain, and numerous
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) risk genes have been identified that impinge on
mTOR signaling and cause altered growth and connectivity at the level of brain areas/circuits or individual cell
types. Mutations in dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1a (DYRK1A) cause
microcephaly and neuronal undergrowth in a subset of individuals with ASD and ID, as well as in mouse
models. The mechanisms by which mutations in DYRK1A lead to microcephaly and ASD/ID are unknown but
are critical to identify for the development of targeted treatments. Given the observations that multiple ASD risk
genes that impact overall brain growth exhibit altered mTOR signaling and that decreased mTOR signaling in
the developing cerebral cortex has been linked with microcephaly, pyramidal neuron undergrowth and deficits
in behavior and cognition, we are testing the hypothesis that DYRK1A mutations cause microcephaly,
neuronal undergrowth and ASD-relevant behavioral deficits through dysregulated mTOR signaling.
Preliminary data collected during the previous funding period indicate that mTOR signaling is downregulated in
the developing cerebral cortex of Dyrk1a mutant mice, and that upregulation of mTOR signaling via genetic
suppression of Pten or pharmacological treatment with IGF-1 can rescue microcephaly and neuronal
undergrowth in this model. The two aims of this proposal are designed to: 1) profile the effects of cerebral
cortical Dyrk1a mutations on neuroanatomical and behavioral phenotypes relevant to the DYRK1A clinical
population and to dysregulated mTOR signaling, and 2) test the hypothesis that Dyrk1a and mTOR signaling
act in a common regulatory network to influence ASD-relevant brain growth and behavioral phenotypes.
Completion of this project will elucidate molecular and cellular mechanisms of microcephaly, neuronal
undergrowth and ASD-relevant behavioral deficits caused by mutations in DYRK1A and other ASD/ID risk
genes that impinge on the mTOR pathway and will guide the development of treatments for the DYRK1A
clinical population."
10990186,"Title: Unraveling the Interplay Between Self-Organization and Antimicrobial Resistance Evolution Across
Spatial Scales
The rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious threat to global health. Most microbial populations
affecting human health are spatially self-organized across many scales, ranging from small surface attached
biofilms to populations distributed across the lumen of the gut. Although laboratory evolution in tight synergy with
theory has emerged as a powerful experimental approach to study AMR evolution in well-mixed test tube
environments, we know little about the impact of spatial self-organization on AMR evolution. The challenges are
to (i) track AMR evolution at high (ideally cell) resolution in space and time (ii) across the variety of spatial scales
and structures using (iii) a single bacterial species and (iv) the joint modeling of population genetics and self-
organization. Finally, while in vitro studies are ideal settings for deriving general rules for a wide range of
structures, an in vivo implementation is needed to test whether those rules have any significance to actual within
host AMR evolution.
The objective of the proposed research is to measure and model how AMR evolution depends on the self-
organization of bacterial populations, ranging from micro-scale biofilms to gut-lumen distributed populations.
To this end, the P.I.s propose tightly-controlled experiments to track AMR evolution in a model pathogen (V.
cholerae) both in vitro (microfluidics) and in vivo (zebrafish) spanning cellular to community-level scales, as well
as extrapolating simulations and theory. The proposed research leverages an intense dialog between population
genetic theory and experiment to achieve a predictive understanding of self-organization in microbial populations
in terms of the joint actions of individual cells.
The P.I.s have three specific aims. First, they will advance a synthetic mutagenesis system to engineer V.
cholerae strains that enable tracking evolutionary processes in space and time. Second, they use advanced
time-lapse imaging to monitor the spatio-temporal establishment of AMR clones from de novo mutations,
standing variation and extrinsic invasion across a multi-scale panel of microfluidic cavities and in zebrafish as a
host model system. Third, they will develop mathematically models to explain the observed structure-dependent
rapidity of AMR evolution and generalize the obtained insights to conditions not tested in experiments.
The P.I.s develop microfluidic techniques to control the self-organization of bacterial populations, synthetic
biology and imaging techniques to track complex evolutionary processes via fluorescent imaging and employ
state-of-the-art assays to study the zebrafish gut microbiome. These methods along with our computer
simulations will be of broad utility to the biophysics community for the goal of dissecting collective properties of
microbial populations.

10993034,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Insulin resistance is a driver of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Despite viral suppression, people living with HIV (PLWH)
have concerningly high rates of both insulin resistance and T2D. In determining what underlies this, we have
focused on the fact that whereas obesity is a common trait in humans, T2D risk is increased by “metabolically
unhealthy obesity” (MUO). Emerging observations highlight two factors promoting MUO in the general
population: 1) reduced mitochondrial content and fewer mitochondria-enriched “brown/beige” adipocytes in the
subcutaneous fat (SCAT) and 2) development of SCAT fibrosis. Interestingly, limiting brown/beige fat biogenesis
in mice promotes SCAT fibrosis and insulin resistance, whereas increasing it remarkably blocks fibrosis and
improves insulin sensitivity. With this in mind, we and others have observed that PLWH have dramatically
increased SCAT fibrosis, prompting us to wonder whether PLWH also have suppressed brown/beige fact activity,
and what factors dictate this. To this end, we recently identified a subset of adipogenic precursor cells (APCs)
expressing signature markers (Lin–: PDGFRa+: CD81+) that control a reciprocal balance between beige fat
biogenesis and SCAT fibrosis. Specifically, CD81+ APCs give rise to mitochondria-rich brown/beige adipocytes,
whereas CD81 deficiency leads to both SCAT fibrosis and insulin resistance. These data highlight the intriguing
possibility that CD81+ APCs in the SCAT may influence the development of MUO in PLWH. Beige/brown fat is
also a metabolic sink for branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), the circulating levels of which are linked to human
insulin resistance. Activating brown/beige fat biogenesis either pharmacologically or by cold exposure clears
circulating BCAAs in humans; indeed, BCAA clearance is a noninvasive indicator of brown/beige fat activity.
However, BCAA catabolism has not been assessed in PLWH. We hypothesize that a reduced capacity of CD81+
APCs to maintain normal SCAT beige/brown function, reflected by both SCAT fibrosis and impaired BCAA
clearance, drives insulin resistance in PLWH, and that reversing this may improve metabolic health. Leveraging
an innovative cohort of PLWH and uninfected controls, including those with MUO, we propose to test this
hypothesis by A) examining the extent to which loss of CD81+ APC abundance, proliferative capacity, or
differentiation potential predicts SCAT fibrosis and insulin resistance in PLWH (Aim 1); and B) evaluataing BCAA
catabolism, alongside cutting-ege PET-CT quantification of brown/beige fat activity, as a determinant of glucose
homeostasis in PLWH (Aim 2). These studies will be coupled to aligned mechanistic studies in the HIV viral
accessory protein (Vpr) transgenic mouse model, which is interestingly prone to both insulin resistance and
impaired brown/beige fat thermogenic function. By validating a mechanistic index of SCAT health (CD81+ APCs,
fibrosis, BCAA clearance) that predicts MUO, we may reveal ways to prolong the metabolic healthspan of PLWH."
10993876,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Differentiation is a fundamental process underlying cellular identity and plasticity. Traditionally, differentiation is
a transition between less committed/specialized cell states into more committed/specialized state, and this is
believed to be unidirectional. Differentiation is evident in development, division of stem cells, homeostasis or
normal turnover, regeneration following injury, and malignant transformation. Clusters of differentiated cells are
necessary for tumor cell invasion (collective invasion), intravasation, circulation, extravasation and metastasis
(colonization in a distant organ). We have unraveled the critical function of LIN28B (human), an RNA binding
protein, as a master regulator of reprogramming of differentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastasis.
Indeed, LIN28B plays essential roles in embryonic stem cell differentiation and inducible pluripotent stem cell
differentiation but its role in tumor metastasis is not elucidated. Having published that Lin28b (mouse) is
oncogenic in a genetic mouse model with the induction of colonic adenomas and CRC, and about one-third of
human CRC cancers overexpress LIN28B (in turn associated with worse outcomes), we have determined that
LIN28B induces the CDX2 transcriptional factor in promoting primary CRC differentiation. In addition, we have
new evidence that LIN28B directly targets Claudin-1 (CLDN1) mRNA to foster the formation of tight junctions
and cell-cell adhesion, which in turn induces NOTCH3 to modulate metastasis to the liver. We also have new
evidence that Lin28b endows in vivo mouse orthotopically implanted tumoroids that harbor Apc/Kras/p53
mutations to metastasize to the liver as they do not metastasize without Lin28b. Thus, we are defining new
mechanisms that reveal how LIN28B promotes differentiation at the primary CRC site and then leverages
previously unappreciated mechanisms to promote metastasis. We hypothesize that LIN28B promotes primary
CRC differentiation and mediates metastasis through induction and maintenance of a tumor differentiation
program that may involve distinct subclones destined for metastasis. This hypothesis will be pursued through
the following in vivo physiologically relevant interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To identify the molecular
mechanisms by which CLDN1 facilitates CRC metastatic progression in the context of LIN28B overexpression,
with NOTCH3 being an attractive target and determination of other targets; (2) To determine the contribution
of Lin28b to invasion, circulation and distant organ (liver) colonization in a syngeneic in vivo trackable model
of metastatic CRC, allowing us to span the entire metastatic cascade; and (3) To identify subpopulations in
primary CRC, potentially fated for metastasis (e.g. those cells that may display hybrid/partial EMT), and
determine the dependence of their phenotype on Lin28b by integrating single-cell RNA-seq with lineage tracing
(bar-coding). Our novel, mechanistic findings and innovative approaches allow us to provide insights into the
fundamental aspects of cellular differentiation in the context of primary CRC, and elucidate why such
differentiated tumor cells have a proclivity for metastasis, and thus address gaps in the field."

While overall colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality have declined over the last several decades,
CRC incidence and mortality rates continue to be higher in African Americans (AAs) than non-Hispanic Whites
(NHW). Consensus CRC molecular tumor subtypes are important indicators of carcinogenic pathway and
prognosis, and area associated with specific somatic gene mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) phenotype, and
gene-specific methylation, although it is currently unknown whether racial differences in these subtypes
underlie racial disparities in CRC survival as these subtypes were derived from studies largely comprised of
NHW CRCs. The relative contributions of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors on CRC-related
outcomes in AA individuals remain largely unknown and there is a critical need for information about
pathogenesis to improve approaches to screening and treatment. This is especially true for area-level
socioeconomic factors, such as income and housing values, that are associated with higher risk of CRC but for
which the biologic consequences are not yet known. The overall goal of the study is to identify genomic and
social factors associated with CRC pathogenesis in a well-characterized cohort of AA CRC cases. We
hypothesize that tumor biology, here defined by somatic and epigenetic alterations in tumors, explains a
substantial proportion of the racial disparities in CRC outcomes, and area-level factors modify this relationship.
Our long-term goal is to improve our ability to diagnose, treat and prevent CRC through a comprehensive
understanding of the molecular events in tumors that arise in diverse populations."

Doxorubicin is a member of the anthracycline group of chemotherapy drugs prescribed to approximately 60% of
pediatric cancer patients suffering with sarcomas, blastomas, leukemia, and lymphoma. Although doxorubicin is
highly effective in these patients, ~16% of pediatric patients suffer doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) which
can lead to heart failure requiring heart transplant. Our recent work has shown that DIC is 2.5x more
prevalent in African American (AA) survivors of childhood cancer. Despite more than 50 years of research
in this field, there is still, at present, little potential for either predicting or preventing DIC. There is an obvious
need for novel and innovative approaches to overcome this hurdle. Candidate gene and genome-wide
association studies, predominantly in Europeans, have identified >100 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that are statistically correlated with DIC, yet experimental validation has not been feasible due to the difficulty in
isolating and culturing human cardiomyocytes in vitro. In our recent work, we showed that patient-specific human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) are efficient predictors of a patient’s likelihood
of developing DIC, confirming for the first time that there is a genomic basis to DIC. Here, we hypothesize that
hiPSC-CMs can be utilized in three different modalities to study genetic variants associated with DIC in AA
survivors: firstly, to discover novel predictive SNPs; secondly, to validate SNPs; and thirdly, to examine the
modulated pathways and determine genotype-specific cardioprotective methodologies. In Aim 1, we will
generate hiPSC from 100 AA adult survivors of childhood cancer who were exposed to doxorubicin but not to
chest radiotherapy and assess their response to doxorubicin in vitro to validate our previous findings in a large
cohort of survivors with diverse biological covariates to verify the power of this tool. In Aim 2, we will use these
100 patient-specific lines to identify drug response differential expression and chromatin accessibility quantitative
trait loci (deQTL and dcaQTL), assessing biological covariates such as doxorubicin dose, age at childhood
cancer diagnosis, attained age, sex, BMI, radiotherapy (other than involving chest), and cancer diagnosis both
individually and combined. We will then validate these variants with genome editing, and mechanistically
examine pathways causative to DIC susceptibility concentrating on genes with known roles in cardiomyopathy,
cardioprotection, and doxorubicin metabolism. We will then use the discoveries above to discover/repurpose
genome-informed cardioprotective drugs to prevent DIC in a genotype-specific manner. In Aim 3, we will build
a risk prediction model incorporating clinical risk factors and functionally assessed genetic variants above,
assess its prediction performance, validate it in independent AA survivors, and implement it in a web-based and
user-friendly tool for broader clinical and research use. In summary, this work will deliver us the genetic rationale
for why AA survivors experience DIC and provide 1, fully human validated SNP data for clinical application
through a user-friendly tool, and 2, novel cardioprotective pathways that can be targeted to protect against DIC."
10993452,"Simultaneous two-photon imaging and two-photon manipulation of neural activity in freely-
behaving mice
The ability to record and manipulate neural activity in freely-behaving mice is a key step to understand the
neural circuits under natural behavior. One-photon miniscope has become a mature technology and it can
perform calcium imaging and optogenetics simultaneously while the mice freely behave. Though it has
enabled many new discoveries in neuroscience, the ability to image and manipulate neural activity deeper
into the tissue and in higher spatial specificity can further advance the field and enable studying many new
questions. Compared to one-photon, two-photon techniques can access much deeper tissue and have a
much higher spatial specificity. However, it has been challenging to integrate high performance optics into
a compact footprint miniscope to perform simultaneous two-photon imaging and two-photon optogenetics,
due to the excessive challenges in optical and mechanical design.
Here, we propose a new miniscope that can simultaneously perform two-photon calcium imaging and two-
photon optogenetics in freely-behaving mice. We innovatively integrate two different beam forming
techniques in the miniscope for the imaging beam and optogenetics beam. This unique combination
enables a very compact mechanical design and a high optical performance. Crucially, we will achieve a
high-spatiotemporal-resolution in imaging, and patterned stimulation in optogenetics where a group of
user-selected neurons could be simultaneously photostimulated. This allows us to manipulate the
ensemble activity while monitoring the response of the neural circuit, all in cellular resolution. The entire
device can have a dimension <~14x14x25 mm3 and a weight <3 g, suitable to be mounted on the skull of
freely-moving mice. Furthermore, we will custom design and manufacture the optics to support a large field
of view of 400 µm in diameter. This allows us to access a large amount of neurons. Finally, the focal depth
of both beams could be controlled independently so we could image and manipulate the neural activity
across a 3D brain volume.
The success of this project will create a two-photon miniscope that can simultaneously image and
manipulate neural activity, both in cellular resolution, high temporal resolution/specificity and over a large
3D volume deep in the brain tissue, in freely-behaving mice. The proposed miniscope could enable new
research that is previously not possible, such as investigating the neural circuits of 2D navigation and
social behavior. Our miniscope will greatly benefit the neuroscience community, and be readily deployed
to many research labs. While we will design and test the miniscope for mice, its application could be
extended to rats and non-human primates in future."

The Network for Exposomics in the U.S. or NEXUS is designed to advance the science of exposomics. Our
team is focused on operationalizing the exposome by advancing measurement and modeling technologies and
applying them to human health outcomes. We propose to coordinate current and future NIH-funded efforts on
exposomics, and will strive to transform the entire biomedical and public health enterprise by inculcating the

precision environmental health via the formation of the NEXUS Data Sciences Hub. We will support a dynamic
community of practice, develop the constellation and beliefs inherent in a given scientific discipline, and advance
our understanding of the environmental drivers of health and disease. Moreover, this project will establish the
standard for exposomics profiling that integrates digital, biological, and geospatial markers to make Exposome-

10994494,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Breast cancer is the most common form of malignancy in women, accounting for almost one in three new female
cancer diagnoses each year. The primary cause of breast cancer-related deaths is metastatic disease, where
tumor cells disseminate to secondary sites in the body. Human breast tumors exhibit increased sensory nerve
fiber density compared to healthy tissue, and increased innervation is associated with higher rates of distant
organ metastasis. Notably, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly metastatic molecular subtype, exhibits
increased peripheral nerve innervation compared to other subtypes. Previous work in the Oudin lab
demonstrated that sensory nerves promote the in vitro migration and in vivo metastasis of TNBC cells. The goal
of this project is to uncover the mechanism driving increased sensory nerve innervation in TNBC, which could
provide a novel target to reduce metastasis and improve patient survival. TRPV1 is a non-selective cation
channel present on sensory nerves that drives neurite outgrowth and regeneration. Stimulation of TRPV1
activates the c-Jun transcription factor, which upregulates downstream genes involved in neurite outgrowth, such
as interleukin 6 (IL6). Our preliminary transcriptomic analysis revealed that Il6 and other c-Jun target genes
involved in neurite outgrowth are upregulated when primary sensory neurons were co-cultured with TNBC cells.
I also found that TNBC cells promoted sensory neurite outgrowth and increased c-Jun expression in a TRPV1-
dependent manner. I hypothesize that TNBC cell secretions stimulate TRPV1 on sensory nerves in adjacent
healthy tissue, leading to c-Jun activation and an upregulation in genes associated with neurite outgrowth and
regeneration, such as IL6, ultimately driving neurite outgrowth into the tumor microenvironment (TME). In three
specific aims, I will test this hypothesis and further elucidate how TNBC cells recruit sensory nerves into the TME.
In SA1, I will investigate the role of c-Jun and its downstream targets, such as Il6, in driving TNBC cell-mediated
sensory neurite outgrowth in 2D. In SA2, I will utilize a 3D hydrogel model to determine the effects of TNBC cells
on sensory neurite outgrowth and explore the role of TRPV1 in mediating outgrowth. To our knowledge, this
innovative approach will be the first description of nerve-cancer interactions in a 3D system. In SA3, I will
examine the role of TRPV1 in recruiting sensory nerves into mammary tumors in vivo. This will be completed by
both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of TRPV1 in a syngeneic mouse model of TNBC. Successful
completion of these aims will provide valuable insights into the mechanism through which TNBC cells promote
sensory innervation into the TME. As innervation drives TNBC cell metastasis, targeting this newly discovered
mechanism could offer a promising clinical strategy to improve patient outcome. Aligned with this research
proposal, a tailored training plan has been designed that integrates clinical and research training to prepare me
for a career as an independent physician scientist."

 Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease thought to be mediated by autoreactive CD4 and CD8
T cell that orchestrate the death of insulin-producing beta cells within pancreatic islets. This proposal aims to
investigate how antigen-specific immunotherapy (ASI) with a CD4-specific neoepitope can selectively suppress
autoreactive T cells by tolerogenic delivery of antigens in the NOD mouse model of autoimmune diabetes.
Previously, our lab demonstrated that induction of tolerance to a dominant CD4 neoepitope, the 2.5 Hybrid Insulin
Peptide (2.5HIP), can prolong islet graft survival in diabetic NOD mice. In the outlined studies, we will investigate
the mechanistic impact of ASI on the differentiation and function of effector CD4 and CD8 T cells in islet grafts.
The role of IL-10-producing regulatory T cells, expanded by 2.5HIP tolerance induction, will also be examined.
We hypothesize that induction of tolerance to the 2.5HIP expands antigen-specific IL10-producing regulatory T
cells that, directly or indirectly, arrest the effector differentiation and function of autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T
cells within islet grafts. The specific aims of the study are to (1) determine the differentiation and functional states
of antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells following induction of tolerance to the hybrid insulin peptide, and (2)
determine the contribution of IL10-producing regulatory T cells to prolonged graft survival and the suppression
of autoreactive T cells. The completion of the proposed studies is expected to generate high-impact information
on the mechanisms underlying autoreactive T cell suppression and differentiation following induction of antigen-
specific tolerance. Findings from this research will also critically inform antigen-specific therapeutic approaches
for human T1D and other autoimmune diseases."
10994822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in the understanding of the molecular drivers of postoperative atrial fibrillation (poAF),
which is self-limited atrial fibrillation (AF) 2-4 days after surgery. The recurrence rate of AF is eight-fold greater
and mortality risk two-fold greater in poAF patients compared to those that remain in sinus rhythm after surgery.
Thus, it is apparent that current poAF treatments such as beta-blockers, while effective in reducing acute
arrhythmia-related symptoms, do not adequately target the underlying molecular drivers of poAF. As can be
expected after surgery, there is systemic inflammation secondary to tissue damage, and studies show that the
degree of systemic inflammation positively correlates with poAF risk. Current anti-inflammatory agents such as
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs target a broad spectrum of inflammatory mediators and have unwanted
side effects such as acute kidney injury and immunosuppression. Therefore, the rationale for this project is that
targeting a precise molecular pathway within specific cell types has the potential of decreasing poAF and, more
importantly, recurrent AF risk without the unwanted side effects of current anti-inflammatory agents. To this end,
our lab has recently developed and published a novel poAF mouse model consisting of atrial pericardiectomy
and transient aortic clamping. We and others have shown that interleukin (IL)-6 is reproducibly and robustly
elevated in the atria of mice with poAF. In addition, we have found that atrial macrophages mediate atrial IL-6
signaling through production of the IL-6 receptor alpha (IL-6R), which activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase II (CaMKII) in nearby atrial cardiomyocytes (ACMs) and leads to arrhythmogenic ryanodine
receptor-2 (RyR2) Ca2+ leak. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify whether inhibiting atrial IL-6
signaling at multiple levels can abrogate arrhythmogenic RyR2 Ca2+ leak and poAF. We hypothesize that
macrophages, which infiltrate the atria 48-72 hours after cardiac surgery, promote IL-6 trans-signaling to ACMs
through release of IL-6R, resulting in STAT3-mediated CaMKII transcriptional upregulation and RyR2
phosphorylation at Ser2814 and Ca2+ leak. We will test this hypothesis with the following two aims. Aim 1 will
assess whether atrial IL-6 signaling mediated by macrophages is necessary for poAF. Aim 2 will test whether
STAT3 activation is required for RyR2 Ca2+ leak. This project will constitute a significant advancement in the
identification of a targeted treatment for poAF via the IL-6 signaling axis, which has broad impacts on other types
of arrhythmias as well as cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure and atherosclerosis that are also driven
by IL-6-mediated systemic inflammation."

Intimate partner violence (IPV) and depression are substantial public health challenges for U.S. adolescents,
and evidence suggests a clear link between IPV experiences and subsequent depression. Despite their co-
occurrence and grave implications, research has not sufficiently explored the nuances and longitudinal patterns
of these experiences. The proposed research study addresses the intersecting crises of IPV and depression,
focusing on adolescents' unique vulnerability and the consequences of these issues for their short- and long-
term well-being. This study leverages the nationally representative NEXT Generation Health Study (NEXT)
dataset, which spans seven years of longitudinal data collected annually (2010–2017) from a diverse sample of
2,780 adolescents aged 15 through 23. The study examines the longitudinal relationship between IPV and
depression via two specific aims. Aim 1) To identify and characterize subgroups of IPV experience from
mid- to late-adolescence for females and males separately. Using Latent Class Analysis, this aim seeks to
reveal distinct patterns of IPV experience during adolescence using the first four waves of the NEXT, which
measure various types of IPV, including verbal, psychological, physical, and sexual. Subsequently, various
background indicators (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, household structure) will be explored as
predictors of subgroup membership. Because previous research points to sex-specific differences in IPV
experience, these analyses will be conducted separately for females and males. Aim 2) To examine
depression symptom trajectories and the relationship between IPV subgroups and depression
trajectories from mid-adolescence to young adulthood. Using dual trajectory modeling, this aim
investigates longitudinal trajectories of depression for the full NEXT sample, and then within identified IPV
subgroups, exploring variations in onset, duration, and severity of depression symptoms. It is hypothesized that
individuals in subgroups described by more severe, persistent IPV will exhibit higher, more persistent
depression trajectories over time compared to subgroups described by less persistent IPV experiences, with
background indicators influencing these relationships. This study addresses a major gap in knowledge of
the longitudinal relationship between adolescents’ IPV experiences and subsequent depression over
longer time periods during the critical transition from adolescence to young adulthood, reflecting
multiple NIH research priorities. Responsive to the NICHD Child Development and Behavior Branch’s strategic
plan theme of improving child and adolescent health and the transition to adulthood and NIMH’s priority for
mental health disparity research, this study will improve understanding of IPV and depression among
adolescents as they transition to young adulthood. Findings are valuable for tailoring interventions and policies,
as different subgroups may have unique risk factors or needs during this key transition period that has important
implications for adolescents’ future education, work, and well-being."

10992811,"ABSTRACT (parent award, R01 CA251110), unchnaged
Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) for the treatment of CNS cancers often leads to unintended and
debilitating cognitive impairments. CRT also remains the standard of care to counter brain
metastases for other invasive cancers. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying CRT-induced cognitive decline are multifaceted and have not been completely
resolved. Our past findings show that whole-brain, acute CRT induces progressive
neurodegenerative changes, including oxidative stress, reduced neurogenesis, and increased
neuroinflammation. Microglia and astrocytes form complex glial networks in the CNS by pruning
and maintaining thousands of synapses that are actively involved in cognition. Yet, we have
shown that CRT-induced cognitive disruption coincides with astrocytic hypertrophy, elevated
expression of astrogliosis genes, and persistent microglial activation in rodent models. Therefore,
we hypothesize that detrimental glial signaling significantly contributes to cognitive deficits. The
complement system is a potent mediator of the glial activation, but it also has a range of non-
immune functions in the CNS, including synaptic pruning and clearance of apoptotic cells and
cellular debris which is detrimental if dysregulated. Particularly, global elevation in the expression
of complement C1q and C3 in the CNS has been reported in neurodegenerative conditions. Our
findings indicate that acute, whole-brain CRT-mediated chronic microglial activation and reactive
astrocytes, elevated co-expression of complement proteins (C1q, C3) and specific receptors
(C5aR1, TLR4) coincided with cognitive impairments. Reactive gliosis has been shown to
upregulate complement cascade proteins that are destructive to synapses and associated with
neurodegeneration. We hypothesize that brain cancer therapy-induced aberrant activation in the
glial complement cascade leads to cognitive deficits. Our hypothesis is supported by two key
preliminary data sets targeting complement signaling at the upstream (C1q) and the downstream
(C5a) activation branch points. First, exposure of conditional microglia-selective C1q (knockdown)
mice to CRT did not exhibit impaired cognition and showed a lack of neuroinflammation as
compared to irradiated WT mice. Second, treatment with an orally active, BBB permeable, C5a
receptor (C5aR1) antagonist ameliorated acute CRT-induced cognitive deficits and alleviated
microglial activation in the irradiated brain. Our hypothesis will be addressed using a clinically
relevant, fractionated, focal cranial irradiation paradigm ± temozolomide, transgenic and glioma-

The overall goal of the Networking Core is to build a vibrant and dynamic trainee community in kidney, benign
urology and benign hematology-based (KUH) research in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The Networking
Core activities are designed for trainees from high school students through to early career development
awardees who are engaged in basic bench science, translational research, data science, clinical research and
health services research. Engaging and exciting trainees early in their careers regarding KUH-focused research
areas is critical to address the declining numbers of individuals entering the biomedical research workforce. The
Pittsburgh region is uniquely equipped to leverage several already existing robust KUH-focused training
programs on which to build this community, that include high school summer student research experiences,
medical student/resident/fellow research and predoctoral/postdoctoral training.
The Networking Core will support a robust mentoring environment for all KUH trainees, in an effort to increase
the engagement of a diverse group of trainees early in their careers. The Core activities will include a weekly
KUH-focused research seminar series, face-to-face structured interactions across disciplines at our monthly
workshops, and active peer to peer, peer-near peer and alumni networks. The Core will leverage current seminar
series and other educational opportunities to promote inter-departmental cross-talk and team science. A new
virtual platform will be designed to sustain trainee interaction and provide an open forum to exchange ideas
using the Pitt Commons website as a backbone. The Networking Core will develop new community outreach
programs to local high schools and undergraduate schools, and leverage already existing recruitment efforts
from undergraduate summer student research experiences, the Physician Scientist Training Program (PSTP)
and the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) to recruit from undergraduate colleges with significant
enrolment of students who are under-represented in science and medicine."
10985270,"This proposal describes a four-year research career development program for an MD/PhD studying the
circuit physiology of cognitive flexibility, which has relevance for a largely unaddressed symptom domain seen
in schizophrenia (SCZ), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other
conditions. The proposed studies build upon the candidate’s foundation in rodent behavior and advanced cell
and molecular biology techniques, but they will require training to develop new, complementary skills in two
key dimensions: A) computational modeling of combined neural and behavioral data sets, and B) using
synapse-specific optogenetic and pharmacologic manipulations together with state-of the-art markerless
behavioral tracking tools to perform behavioral experiments with real-time interventions. These training goals
are reflected in the expertise of the involved co-mentors (Drs. Christoph Kellendonk and Kiyohito Iigaya),
tailored seminars and didactics, and the strong neuroscience training environment at New York State
Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University. Completing the proposed studies and multi-faceted training plan
will position the candidate with a sought-after combination of skills that will facilitate transitioning into a
productive, independent physician-scientist studying cognitive dysfunctions in mental disorders.
 Acetylcholine (ACh)-releasing neurons of the basal forebrain (BF) are implicated in associative learning
and behavioral flexibility, as measured via the paradigm of reversal learning. However, the timing and
behaviorally relevant effects of ACh input to BF target regions involved in reversal learning, including the
basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (LO), remain largely unexplored. Probing these
mechanisms has translational importance, as reversal learning deficits are measurable in people with SCZ,
ASD, and PTSD, though it is unclear how much these findings are generalizable to disparate learning contexts.
The proposed studies investigate the hypothesis that stimulus-associated changes in BF-derived ACh input to
the BLA and LO regulate discrete behavioral parameters underlying reward-based reversal learning depending
on the associative context used—whether Pavlovian or operant, deterministic or probabilistic. In Aim 1,
computational analysis will be used on simultaneous recordings of ACh activity in the BLA and LO during
reversal learning tasks to discern the specific behavioral parameters, such as prediction error or learning rate,
encoded through each target area and their interactions. In Aim 2, optogenetic control of BF projection neurons
and intravital microinfusions of pharmacologic inhibitors will be employed to demonstrate the necessity of ACh
release in the BLA and LO for the different learning contexts tested, and computational models will be tested
against each other to assess their interpretability and predictive power. These studies and their future
directions will form the basis of my independent research career and help to identify targets for novel therapies
to address deficits in cognitive flexibility, which drive disability and pose barriers to recovery."

 The objective of this Diversity Supplement is to support an 18-month postbaccalaureate research experience
for Rohda Yase. Ms. Yase is a bachelor’s degree candidate who will be applying to enter into an MD-PhD
program in the fall of 2026. The goal of the parent grant (R01 AR074417) is to understand genetic risk factors
for osteoporosis to identify new drug targets to reduce this massive health burden. Ms. Yase’s work will
supplement SA1 of the parent grant, which is to identify novel genes regulating bone mass and mineral accrual
at bone mineral density (BMD)-associated loci in a reverse genetic screen. In SubAim1B, we proposed to
generate and characterize germline loss-of-function mutants for six genes. The proposed work for this diversity
supplement research project will add a seventh gene to SubAim1B. This gene is related to, but distinct from, the
genes being tested in the parent grant. The career development plan, which includes access to a network of
scientific, career, and clinical mentors, attendance of national conferences, and preparatory coursework, is
tailored to Ms. Yase’s career goal of obtaining an MD-PhD and becoming a physician-scientist. In regard to the
training environment, the PI has a successful record of mentoring individuals with similar career goals as Ms.
Yase, and has demonstrated his commitment to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the biomedical
sciences through outreach, mentorship, and service. The expected impact of this project is that Ms. Yase will
gain skills, experience, and mentorship that grant her new research independence and increase her
competitiveness for the most competitive MD-PhD programs."
10990579,"LAC SUMMARY
The scientific mission of this SCORE is to identify stress-immune pathway abnormalities, beginning in fetal
development, that have shared consequences for sex differences in brain circuitry regulating mood and lifelong
recurrent MDD and dysregulation of hormone and immune responses to stress, and autonomic and
neurovascular dysfunction in early midlife. We aim to facilitate transdisciplinary, translational collaboration
among basic and clinical investigators to enhance our understanding of the impact of sex on MDD and central
and peripheral autonomic function and translate this knowledge into sex-selective therapeutics. Further, we
aim to serve as an interdisciplinary resource to train and disseminate findings about sex differences in MDD
and autonomic dysregulation to the scientific and medical communities, policy makers, and the public.
To accomplish our aims in three projects and three cores, we are proposing a series of interdisciplinary and
translational studies from basic and clinical neuroscience and population-level perspectives, integrating
scientists from different disciplines and institutions ranging from the lab bench to the clinical level. In the
Resource Support Core (RSC), we are integrating and introducing novel state-of-the-art technologies, with
some that will cross human and animal work. In the Career Enhancement Core (CEC), educating young
scientists in new approaches and insuring that their future work will translate sex as a biologic variable into
their (and others') thinking in clinical medicine. The Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) is essential in
providing an infrastructure to monitor, integrate, and synergize ongoing activities. The specific aims of the LAC
are to: Coordinate activities of the SCORE; Administer budgets, insuring financial responsibility and
coordination across sites and activities; and Disseminate knowledge through online tools, organizing symposia
and workshops and other avenues to connect the SCORE with the medical community, policy makers, NIH,
and the public."
10990725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Structural remodeling of synapses and circuits is essential to experience-dependent plasticity, as occurs during
the consolidation of learned experiences into long-term memory. Immune dysfunction has been implicated in
numerous cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative diseases, leading to increasing
interest in the function of brain-resident macrophages known as microglia, which are the dominant immune cell
in the brain parenchyma. We previously published that the IL-1 family cytokine Interleukin-33, which is made by
astrocytes during development, signals to its obligate receptor IL1RL1 expressed on microglia to promote
microglial activation and phagocytic function. In preliminary data that forms the basis for this proposal, we identify
a novel population of IL-33 expressing neurons in two adult brain regions: hippocampus and frontal cortex. In
detailed structural analyses in the hippocampus, we find that neuron-specific deletion of IL-33 or microglial-
specific deletion of IL-33 R leads to fewer dendritic spines, diminished markers of spine plasticity known as spine
head filopodia, and impaired neurogenesis. Furthermore, loss of this signaling pathway leads to deficits in
contextual fear conditioning: mice are able to normally learn to recognize a fear context but have a progressive
decrease in their ability to discriminate the fear context from a neutral context emerging at 15-30 days post
training. Mechanistically, we find that extracellular matrix proteins (the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans brevican
and aggrecan) accumulate in the hippocampus of IL-33 deficient animals. We find that microglia engulf aggrecan,
and that loss of IL-33 signaling diminishes this engulfment. We also developed a neuronal gain of function
construct that constitutively secretes IL-33. We find this is sufficient to increase hippocampal spine numbers,
microglial ECM engulfment, and to clear ECM around dendritic spines. Based on these preliminary data, this
proposal will test the central hypothesis that neuron-derived IL-33 drives microglial remodeling of ECM to
promote circuit plasticity in support of memory consolidation. Aim One will explore the molecular regulation of
IL-33 release from neurons and its activity dependence, and test two candidate proteases mediating microglial
remodeling in response to IL-33. Aim Two will test the impact of this neuron-microglia signaling on the ECM
composition of the frontal cortex with a focus on perineuronal nets and determine its impact on connectivity of
the cortical microcircuit. Aim 3 will use calcium imaging in a contextual fear conditioning task to test how neuronal
activity patterns shift during the transition from recent to remote memories, addressing key questions regarding
the structural changes that underlie memory consolidation. Together, these studies will systematically dissect
the role of a novel cellular circuit regulating plasticity in the healthy brain. The outcome of this work has
implications for understanding cognitive dysfunction in numerous diseases linked to microglia and the immune
system , including schizophrenia and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease."
10992941,"Project Summary
Since the advent of in vitro fertilization over 40 years ago, over 8 million children have been born using these
assisted reproductive technologies (ART). New procedures and interventions are continuously being developed
to improve efficiency, safety, and success while allowing for greater options for patients desiring fertility, now
and in the future. ART has been associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes and markers of
future cardiometabolic disease in some offspring. Investigation of specific interventions, including emerging
technologies such as oocyte vitrification, is critical to understanding the mechanisms of these potential short-
and long-term health effects. Importantly, the majority of children born from IVF are under the age of 30, therefore
the long-term consequences of conception with ART across the lifespan remain to be seen. Furthermore, ART
is constantly evolving with new technologies being rapidly incorporated into routine clinical care without long-
term follow-up data yet available. The vast majority of pregnancies following ART are healthy; however, our prior
studies have demonstrated some of these individuals have disrupted epigenomes; these disruptions are
associated with clinical phenotypes (e.g. low birth weight) and these epigenetic signatures vary by specific ART
intervention (e.g. fresh vs frozen embryo transfers). We hypothesize that ART pregnancies with the greatest
epigenetic disruption will be more likely to have adverse perinatal outcomes and be more likely to exhibit
cardiometabolic changes during childhood, and that these disruptions will vary based on specific ART
interventions. In Specific Aim 1 we will investigate the effect of oocyte vitrification on epigenomic perturbations
in DNA methylation in both embryonic (cord blood) and placental tissues and examine the effect of maternal age
on these epigenetic changes. In Aim 2 we will determine whether 1) a disrupted placental epigenome or 2) cell
free fetal DNA fraction, are associated with ART interventions and if these markers can identify patients with
adverse perinatal outcomes. In Aim 3 we will determine whether perturbations in DNA methylation at birth persist
into childhood and are associated with adverse metabolic parameters and/or abnormal female reproductive
function in childhood. This proposal continues our work examining individual ART interventions to identify those
that lead to the greatest perturbations in the epigenome, and additionally, those that may potentially lead to
adverse outcomes both in pregnancy and into adulthood. Though restrictions on human embryo research
prevent us from mechanistic studies in humans, our parallel aims in Project 2 will allow us to further investigate
the mechanisms involved in ART-associated adverse outcomes in a mouse model. In addition, our work in
Project 3, will further investigate the role of sex in ART outcomes using innovative in vitro models to study early
placentation. Importantly, these studies are critical for developing diagnostic tools to screen for and reduce ART-
associated risks and to advance our understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease."
10992942,"Abstract
Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are invaluable for the increasing number individuals who require
interventions to treat their infertility. Nevertheless, ART-conceived children are at increased risk for loss-of-
imprinting disorders, e.g., Angelman Syndrome, resulting from epigenetic errors, as well as placental disorders,
abnormal growth, congenital malformations, and postnatal cardiac and metabolic disorders. These problems
likely arise because ART procedures take place when the preimplantation embryo is being epigenetically
reprogrammed. Because it is difficult to conduct studies using human embryos, a mouse model system, which
anticipated risks associated with ART, will be used to assess the effect of ART interventions on placental
morphology, imprinted gene regulation, growth, physiological phenotypes of the offspring, and epigenetic gene
regulation, including DNA methylation and chromatin structure genome-wide. Oocyte vitrification is being
increasingly used for donors as well as older women to prolong their fertility. Little is known, however, about its
effects on embryo development and resulting offspring. Specific Aim 1 will use our mouse model to assess
whether oocyte vitrification in the context of IVF exerts additional dysregulation of epigenetic profiles, placental
morphology and fetal sufficiency. Moreover, although the majority offspring conceived using ART are healthy, a
small percent have abnormal imprinted gene regulation and outlier DNA methylation phenotypes. Specific Aim
2 will characterize phenotypes associated with mice that have extremely abnormal DNA methylation at ICRs to
determine if they too exhibit adverse metabolic and epigenetic outcomes as they age. Finally, very little work
has addressed the mechanism(s) of adverse epigenetic patterns in ART conceptuses. Embryo culture
disproportionately contributes to adverse phenotypes of IVF offspring, i.e., abnormal morphological and
epigenetic patterns. We hypothesize that elevated oxygen concentration during embryo culture contributes to
this phenotype via dysregulation of oxygen-sensitive proteins. Specific Aim 3 will examine the role of O2
environment in mediating adverse placental and embryonic outcomes in ART by adjusting oxygen
concentration and assaying gestational outcomes. Additionally, to address the mechanism of elevated O2 in
the extensive epigenetic dysregulation we observe in cultured embryos, we will focus on the histone
demethylases, KDM6A (H3K27me2/3 demethylase) and KDM5A (H3K4me2/3 demethylase), whose enzymatic
activity depends on O2 concentration, and determine changes in the global chromatin landscape of these two
histone marks in blastocysts as a function of O2 concentration. Results of these experiments will provide
information regarding the linkage between epigenetic changes and health of offspring conceived by ART.
Together with results from other projects in this P50, our findings may identify experimental modifications to
ART procedures that will improve offspring outcomes."

MD Anderson Cancer Center is a comprehensive cancer center established within the University of Texas
System in 1941. In 2017, the institution welcomed Peter Pisters, MD, as its fifth full-time president and PI of the
CCSG. The mission of MD Anderson is to eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation and the world through
outstanding programs that integrate patient care, research and prevention, and through education for
undergraduate and graduate students, trainees, professionals, employees and the public. MD Anderson is
dedicated wholly to the study of cancer involving a continuum of basic, clinical and population-based
investigation, with an emphasis on multidisciplinary translational research. MD Anderson employed more than
19,530 people in FY17, including 1,743 faculty members, of whom 705 (40%) are CCSG program members.
More than 137,000 people sought care at MD Anderson in FY17 of whom 20,839 were newly diagnosed cancer
patients. Annual citations in Web of Science have increased 23% from 3,260 in 2013, to 4,009 in 2017, including
686 (17%) articles in journals with an impact factor >10, and 244 (6%) articles in journals with an impact factor
>20. The total research budget increased 26% from $671M in 2013 to $844M in 2017. Direct cost NCI research
grant support, excluding training grants and the CCSG, has increased 34%, from $67M in 2013 to $90M in 2018,
with the largest number of NCI grants for any institution (>200), including 6 SPOREs, 4 P01s and 35 U awards.
Research Programs have been reduced to 16 and support is requested for 14 shared resources. Since the last
CCSG renewal, research has been strengthened with recruitment of 97 tenured and tenure track faculty, of
whom 18 are supported by recruitment awards from CPRIT totaling $63M. Team science has been enhanced
through institutional support of the MD Anderson's Moon Shots ($383M), focused on reducing mortality from 13
major cancers through multi-disciplinary efforts that build on research emerging from the CCSG programs. In
FY17, 10,283 participants were enrolled in 1,108 interventional clinical research protocols, of which 936 were
treatment (therapeutic) studies that accrued 6,271 subjects. Over the past decade MD Anderson investigators
have contributed to the clinical evaluation of 72 of 130 FDA oncology drug approvals, either as a new entity or
for a new indication, with 41 of these approvals since the last CCSG renewal. In addition to the main hospital,
Houston Area Locations provide prospective, multidisciplinary care and supportive services, with an increasing
emphasis on access to clinical trials including national studies. Cancer prevention and survivorship is a priority
for MD Anderson with an emphasis on molecular epidemiology, behavioral science, clinical cancer prevention
and early detection research to reduce the burden of cancer within Texas and worldwide."

Azoospermia impacts 1% of men globally, which translates to 645,000 men between the ages of 20 and 50 in
the United States. It is estimated that genetic causes explain 50% of infertility. Improved knowledge about
the genetic basis of infertility and associated overall health comorbidities will aid in the counseling of
infertile couples; justify the development of diagnostic screens; and may lead to patient-specific
treatment options. In the current personalized medicine era with reduced cost whole genome sequencing and
facile genome editing technologies, it is feasible to discover genetic underpinnings of infertility and develop
targeted therapies. Project 1 will discover genetic variants in men with unexplained nonobstructive
azoospermia (NOA) to identify targets for development of clinical diagnostics or therapy. In addition, Project 1
assemble an international team of experts to develop criteria for review and interpretation of infertility-
associated variants to be included in ClinGen, which will facilitate inclusion in clinical diagnostic screens.
Project 2 will establish high throughput in vitro gametogenesis platforms and a 100% chimeric mouse strategy
for rapid validation of azoospermia-associated variants discovered in Project 1. Project 2 will also evaluate the
impact of epigenetic modifiers on primordial germ cell development. Project 3 will provide “gold standard”
reproductive phenotyping in mouse models with human NOA associated variants discovered in Project 1 and
validated in Project 2. In mouse models of NOA, Project 3 will test the safety and feasibility of Sertoli cell and
germ cell gene therapies. Results of all interlinked projects will help justify the use of whole genome
sequencing as a diagnostic screen for male infertility and inform the public dialogue on the risks and benefits of
gene therapy in and around the germline. Core A will provide administrative oversight and facilitate
communications and data exchange among projects and cores to ensure that this P50 program achieves an
impact that is greater than the sum of its parts. The Education-Outreach Core will maximize the public impact
of this P50 by developing Saturday Academy hands-on laboratory experiences in reproduction and genetics for
middle school and high school students in underserved communities in Pittsburgh, Portland and Ithaca. P50
trainees from all sites will also contribute teaching modules to The DataJam, a national nonprofit that runs
academic education programs and competitions to engage middle school, high school and community college
students in data analytics and critical thinking."

Assistive technology (AT) has the potential to improve the health and function of older adults. However, multiple
barriers, such as perceived stigma, financial costs, and perceived threats to privacy, impact older adult
acceptance and use of AT. Studies identify that older adults from historically underrepresented (HU) groups have
less access to and use of AT. In addition, older adults particularly those from HU groups, are often excluded from
participating in research and in AT development. Further, AT development occurs in silos with little, if any, input
from older adults and other disciplines (clinicians, social scientists, healthcare providers), thus limiting innovation
and new ways of thinking about AT use and the needs of older adults. Our long-term goal is to increase the
number and reach of effective AT interventions designed to improve the health and function of older adults,
increase aging in place, and reduce disparities. The objective of this proposal is to create a mature and
sustainable infrastructure that facilitates the formation and collaboration of transdisciplinary teams of engineers
and computer scientists, healthcare providers, social scientists, and community partners to develop, test, and
disseminate innovative AT interventions for older adults from diverse and historically underrepresented
populations with age-related or multiple chronic conditions. To achieve this goal, we will expand the Community-
Academic Aging Research Network (CAARN) infrastructure in a new direction to facilitate older adult
engagement in AT and to connect engineers and computer scientists, healthcare providers, and end users to
promote a better understanding of the technology needs of a diverse older adult population and create an
environment for transdisciplinary engagement. We will accomplish our objective through three aims: Aim 1: To
bring together multidisciplinary researchers (engineers, computer scientists,, clinicians, social scientists) and
community end users to investigate the needs for and barriers to using AT from historically underrepresented
communities prior to design; Aim 2: To facilitate community-academia partnerships to develop new or refine
existing AT through iterative cycles of input/design/prototype testing and feedback; and Aim 3: To demonstrate
preliminary feasibility, acceptability, safety, and functionality of new and/or refined AT among adopters,
implementers, and end users of the technology. The result of this new infrastructure will be the development of
new AT that: a) is feasible to use with broad reach and adoption; and b) is likely to be effective in promoting
equitable older adult independence and health."
10981164,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase
(PYCR) form a metabolic relationship known as the “proline cycle”, a novel pathway that
impacts cellular growth and death pathways. The proline cycle is central to the
metabolic shift that enables tumorigenesis and supports the metastatic cascade of
cancer cells. PRODH is upregulated in metastasizing breast cancer cells, and PYCR1 is
one of the most consistently upregulated enzymes across multiple cancer cell types.
Thus, proline cycle enzymes have been proposed as potential cancer drug targets. A
major goal of this project is to gain insight into whether these enzymes have binding
sites that can be exploited for small molecule binding and establish target tractability,
i.e., the likelihood of identifying modulators that interact effectively with these targets.
Initial results are encouraging, as the chemical probes developed in the first phase of
this project show activity in cellular and animal models of cancer. These results motivate
our proposal to (1) develop new and more potent reversible inhibitors of PRODH and
PYCR1, (2) explore the mechanism-based covalent inactivation of PRODH, and (3)
define the mechanistic roles of the proline cycle using chemical probes in cancer cells.
With these studies we will mechanistically dissect the role of proline metabolism in
cancer progression. We expect this knowledge will in the long-term aid the development
of new therapeutic strategies against cancer."

Osteocytes are the most numerous cell in bone tissue, which act as mechanosensors and coordinate adaptive
bone remodeling. Current model systems have been unable to unify the mechanisms by which osteocytes to
sense mechanical stimuli, transmit signals across an extensive 3D network, and how these transient signals
drive adaptive bone remodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts. In this work, we will use a new bone multicellular
unit (BMU) chip that enables longitudinal visualization of mechanosensitive calcium signaling across 3D
osteocyte networks, enabling and characterization of the role of this signaling mechanism on the
mechanoadaptive response of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in normal and injured states. Using BMU-chip, this
work will test the hypothesis, ‘Discontinuity in 3D osteocyte networks alters mechanically-evoked calcium signal
propagation which in turn modulates the spatiotemporal remodeling of effector cells’ using three specific aims.
Aim 1 will define how Pulsed Unidirectional Fluid Flow Stimuli (PUFFS) modulates dynamic changes in calcium
signaling across 3D network of osteocytes. Aim 2 will determine how 3D osteocyte networks subjected to PUFFS
modulate direct and indirect signaling and osteoblastic bone formation and osteoclastic resorption activities. Aim
3 will identify how targeted disruption of 3D osteocyte networks influence calcium signaling and long-term
functional outcomes. Completion of the proposed aims will provide a comprehensive understanding of how
mechanically evoked calcium signaling across osteocyte networks modulates functional outcomes within the
BMU in normal and injured conditions. Our team, with complementary expertise in biomedical engineering, bone
cell biology, orthopedic surgery and statistical analysis is well suited to execute this project. In the future, BMU-
chips could be utilized to probe other mechanotransduction pathways, and accelerate the development and
evaluation of drugs to treat bone disease."
10980676,"Despite considerable efforts toward vaccination, influenza and its complications continue to kill tens of
thousands of people annually in the U.S., making it the eighth leading cause of death nationally. There is
considerable interindividual variability in the immune response to influenza, which is due to the polymorphic
nature of the immune system and other unidentified factors. Our preliminary data suggest that exposure to the
synthetic food additive tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is one factor that can impact the effectiveness of the
adaptive immune response to influenza. Our published studies demonstrate that tBHQ inhibits the
differentiation of CD4 T cells into Th1 cells, a key cell type in antiviral host defense that is particularly important
in the development of immunological memory to influenza. Our preliminary data indicate that tBHQ also
markedly inhibits CD8 T cell function. Furthermore, we have found that mice on a tBHQ diet have a markedly
impaired T cell response to influenza (A/PR/8/1934 H1N1 strain). While these studies indicate that tBHQ
impairs both CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to viral pathogens, the underlying mechanism remains unknown.
Elucidation of this mechanism will not only provide insight into ways to minimize the impact of diet on the
response to viral pathogens, but could also reveal a novel regulatory pathway in T cells that is important for T
cell polarization and function. The central hypothesis for this project is that tBHQ activates the transcription
factor, Nrf2, which inhibits T-bet-dependent development of antiviral CD4 and CD8 effector T cells. This
hypothesis is based in part upon our preliminary studies demonstrating that mice on a tBHQ diet have an
impaired immune response to influenza. Specifically, mice exposed to tBHQ through diet, at concentrations
present in human food, show a marked decrease in the production of cytokines, such as IFNγ, TNFα and IL-6,
a reduction in the numbers of influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and increased viral burden. In addition to
diminished primary response (i.e. first exposure to influenza), mice on a tBHQ diet also show an impaired
memory response to influenza, causing much greater decrease in body weight and decreased numbers of
influenza-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells. Furthermore, our in vitro studies demonstrate that robust activation of
Nrf2 by tBHQ impairs CD4 and CD8 T cell function, as evidenced by decreased Th1 polarization, impaired
IFNγ, IL-2 and granzyme B induction by activated CD8 T cells and diminished expression and activity of T-bet,
a transcription factor that is critical for Th1 polarization and CD8 T cell effector function. We propose to test our
hypothesis by 1) determining the mechanism by which activation of Nrf2 by tBHQ inhibits Th1 differentiation
and the effector function of CD8 T cells, 2) determining the mechanism by which tBHQ inhibits the primary
adaptive immune response to influenza and 3) identifying the role of Nrf2 in the impaired memory T cell
response to influenza in tBHQ-fed mice."
10980996,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Postoperative pneumonia occurs in ~2-8% of patients following various surgeries and increases the length of
hospital stay and mortality. Pneumonia is a common cause of sepsis. Some pneumonia survivors, including
those with post-intensive care unit syndrome, suffer from cognitive deficits, reducing their quality of life and
inflicting healthcare and financial hardships. Strikingly, pneumonia-associated microorganisms (e.g., P.
aeruginosa) trigger lung endothelial production and release of several cytotoxic amyloids (e.g., tau and Aβ) that
are key pathological hallmarks of dementia. Cytotoxic tau produced by lung endothelial cells in response to
bacterial pneumonia infection accumulates in the brain, reduces dendritic spine density, impairs learning and
memory, and causes neuronal tauopathy. We recently found that P. aeruginosa infection causes blood-brain
barrier breakdown and gliosis. There is growing appreciation and strong evidence that neurovascular uncoupling,
cerebral blood flow reductions and dysregulation, and breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, including the loss of
pericytes, are early events leading to cognitive decline and dementia, including in the setting of pneumonia and
infections. Apolipoprotein (APOE)-ε4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for sporadic dementia, increases infection
severity (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and promotes blood-brain barrier damage and pericyte degeneration. Whether
pneumonia-elicited lung endothelial cytotoxic tau variants initiate blood-brain barrier breakdown to induce
neurovascular unit dysfunction (e.g., pericyte injury, gliosis, and impaired hemodynamics), and whether APOE-
ε4-induced neurovascular unit dysfunction exacerbates the negative impact of lung endothelial tau on the brain
remains to be determined and are the focus of this study. Using state-of-the-art methodologies, this proposal
innovatively uses 1) fast-speed, high-resolution two-photon intravital microscopy, 2) quantitative tau and
neurovascular unit plasma assays, 3) pathological assessment of lung tau and neurovascular unit dysfunction
in post-mortem human tissue, 4) lung endothelium targeted mice and adeno-associated viruses, and 5) anti-tau
antibodies. This proposal tests the scientifically supported and novel hypotheses that 1) lung endothelial tau
disrupts the neurovascular unit, 2) APOE-ε4 exacerbates the impact of lung endothelial tau on the neurovascular
unit, and 3) anti-tau antibodies to prevent neurovascular unit dysfunction caused by pneumonia. This is a
translational preclinical project bridging in vitro experiments, experimental models and clinical samples, and is
pioneering in that it synthesizes experts in lung and brain biology to understand the impact of pneumonia-elicited
lung endothelial tau on neurovascular unit functions, with consideration of health disparities."
10981851,"Abstract: Over the course of an animal’s lifetime, cell-fate decisions are continually being made
that allow for normal development and growth as well as the health of the adult organism. Cell-
fate decisions require precisely controlled temporal and spatial expression of particular proteins.
In early vertebrate development and certain adult cell types, such as those of the nervous system,
this regulated protein expression relies heavily on post-transcriptional mechanisms, particularly
translational control. This proposal focuses on a conserved RNA binding protein named Bicaudal-
C (Bicc1) that functions in translational regulation and is essential for normal vertebrate
development. While it is established that Bicc1 is an RNA binding protein required for the normal
development and health of vertebrates, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Bicc1
performs these roles are largely unknown and thus represent a major gap in knowledge. The long-
term research goal is to define the molecular mechanisms by which developmentally important
RNA binding proteins select their target mRNAs and control mRNA expression to effect specific
cell-fate decisions, and to understand how defects in these processes contribute to cell
dysfunction and organismal disease. The central hypothesis is that Bicc1 selects particular target
mRNAs through a complex RNA binding domain with multiple independent RNA binding surfaces
and regulates translation via additional distinct regions yet to be defined. This hypothesis is based
on extensive research from the lab focused on defining how Bicc1 directs the earliest, maternal
stages of vertebrate development in the model organism Xenopus laevis. This work has
established Bicc1 as a paradigm for understanding how RNA binding proteins control mRNA
translation to direct complex cell-fate decisions. Building on extensive conceptual and technical
progress over the past decade, the Specific Aims will address the central hypothesis by: 1.
Defining how Bicc1 selects its target mRNAs; 2. Defining how Bicc1 represses translation; and 3.
Determining the role of Bicc1 RNA binding and translational repression activities in Xenopus cell-
fate specification. The research employs a rigorous and multidisciplinary strategy incorporating
RNA-protein biochemistry, unique translation-reporter assays, genome-enabled approaches,
reverse molecular genetics, and embryology to define the molecular mechanisms by which the
conserved and disease-relevant RNA binding protein Bicc1 directs the earliest cell-fate decisions
essential for vertebrate development."

Effective treatment schemes have reduced breast cancer mortality, but precise identification of women at
increased risk of developing breast cancer, to personalize screening and preventive interventions, accordingly,
is a major outstanding challenge. This urgent clinical need is most prominent among Black women, in view of
their higher breast cancer mortality than White women. Studies have consistently shown the potential of artificial
intelligence in the form of deep learning (DL) to elucidate novel mammographic signatures highly predictive of
breast cancer. However, currently available DL models were developed in mostly White populations, and
therefore, may generalize poorly in Black populations that would benefit from risk-based tailored screening and
preventive strategies. Moreover, most related DL studies rely on digital mammography (DM) images, although
digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has rapidly replaced DM in the US. These studies also paid limited attention
to model interpretability, which is critical for clinical translation of DL models. We will leverage a unique multi-site
resource of screening data from Black women (4507 cases; 90,701 controls; with 5-year follow-up) and state-of-
the-art DL and medical imaging informatics tools, with the aim to enable accurate long-term (i.e., 5-year) breast
cancer risk assessment for Black women. We will accomplish this through developments of DL imaging
signatures of breast cancer risk with the new standard of breast cancer screening, DBT; thorough evaluations of
their clinical utility in a multi-site setting; and deployment/dissemination activities to enable further evaluations
and refinements based on feedback. We propose three aims. SA1 will develop a DBT-driven breast cancer risk
score via DL and its combination with the clinical Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS) risk model into a hybrid
breast cancer risk prediction tool. SA2 will perform independent clinical utility evaluations of our breast cancer
risk prediction tool. SA3 will focus on translational innovation, by developing the deployment framework and
disseminating our tools, knowledge, and resources to the community. Our study will be the first of its kind on
computational mammographic signatures of breast cancer risk among Black women. We anticipate that the
successful completion of our aims will provide a novel tool for accurate long-term breast cancer risk assessment
among Black women, extensive multi-site validation data and a complementary deployment/dissemination
framework to enable further evaluations in research settings. We expect that the groundbreaking outcomes of
this project will have a major impact on mitigating racial disparities in breast cancer through key advancements
in personalized risk assessment for Black women, which, in turn, will lay the foundation for equitable precision
breast cancer screening and prevention strategies."
10981896,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Flowing blood generates a frictional force called shear stress that plays an important role in endothelial
dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Branches and bends of arteries are exposed to low and disturbed flow (d-flow),
a mechanical environment that promotes vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Conversely, physiologically
high shear stress generated from steady laminar flow (s-flow) is protective. Helical flow (h-flow) associated with
advanced shear stress exists not only in the ascending aorta but also in other parts such as the right coronary
artery, descending aorta, common iliac artery, and common femoral artery. H-flow may have several positive
physiological roles, such as suppressing/eliminating areas of flow stagnation, preventing the accumulation of
atherogenic lipids on the luminal surfaces of arteries, and enhancing oxygen transport from the blood to the
arterial wall. Endothelial cells (ECs) are critical sensors of the shear stress that contributes to atherosclerosis.
Efferocytosis is a process by which apoptotic tissue is recognized for engulfment by phagocytic cells, such as
professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages and immature dendritic cells) and non-professional phagocytes
(e.g., ECs, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and some stromal cells). Defective efferocytosis in macrophages promotes
advanced atherosclerosis. However, the mechanisms by which shear stress environments regulate EC
efferocytosis and its implications in atherosclerosis remain largely unknown. The central hypothesis to be tested
in this project is that blood flow patterns regulate EC efferocytosis and subsequent endothelial dysfunction and
contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. Our long-term goal is to dissect the relationship between blood
flow patterns and EC efferocytosis and its role in the development of atherosclerosis. Our specific aims are Aim
1- Define the role of blood flow patterns in EC efferocytosis and endothelial dysfunction, Aim 2- Determine the
role of MerTK in endothelial mechanotransduction, and Aim 3- Evaluate the contribution of EC efferocytosis in
atherosclerosis. Defining the mechanisms of efferocytosis regulation will be necessary to target endothelial
mechanotransduction and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. The proposed research is innovative in the sense
that we will connect blood flow patterns, EC efferocytosis, and endothelial mechanotransduction. We will also
evaluate the novel mechanism of EC efferocytosis and its contribution to atherosclerosis."
10982147,"Interactions between the immune system and the intestinal stem cell (ISC) compartment are poorly understood,
as are the mechanisms by which ISCs respond to immune-mediated insults. In the previous R01 cycle, we made
several major discoveries: 1) T cells infiltrate and directly target the ISC compartment in vivo. 2) T cells mediate
Interferon-γ-dependent ISC killing in models of graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and autoimmunity. 3) Lymphocyte-
derived cytokines also target ISCs to promote JAK/STAT-dependent epithelial regeneration, and this
immunobiology can be translated clinically as demonstrated by our recently completed trial of Interleukin (IL)-22
treatment for patients with GVHD. 4) We have identified a new mechanism of epithelial regeneration whereby
ISC-derived IL-33 induces the stem cell niche to augment epidermal growth factor (EGF) production after
damage. Additionally, new unpublished data uncover the surprising finding that another EGF receptor (EGFR)
ligand, Amphiregulin (Areg), which is thought to promote epithelial regeneration, can signal directly to T cells,
drive their proliferation, and promote immune-mediated epithelial injury. Preliminary findings show that CD4 T
cells upregulate Areg and EGFR upon activation, increasing their expansion, tissue infiltration, ISC loss, and
intestinal pathology. The newly discovered IL-33-dependent epithelial regeneration pathway and our new data
identifying a pathologic role for the T cell Areg/EGFR axis in tissue damage present a critical translational conflict:
the IL-33/EGF regenerative circuit supports the therapeutic potential of EGF administration, but administering
EGFR ligands also has the potential to drive further immune-mediated damage by stimulating T cell EGFR.
The goals of this project are to investigate 1) the function of the EGFR pathway in activated T cells, 2) EGFR
function within the ISC compartment in models of immune-mediated tissue damage, and 3) how these pathways
can be targeted to reduce immune-mediated damage and enhance regeneration. Utilizing a combination of in
vivo and ex vivo T cell activation models, as well as ex vivo modeling of tissue responses to T-cell-mediated
damage using murine and human organoid culture systems, we will test the hypothesis that Areg produced by
activated CD4 T cells drives autocrine EGFR signaling and T cell proliferation, leading to tissue infiltration and
ISC compartment damage in the allogeneic setting. This represents a potential paradigm shift in the
understanding of Areg and EGFR. We will also test the hypothesis that ISCs respond to this damage by
enhancing the function of their own niche, identifying ISCs as not just the mediators but the regulators of
regeneration. This study will thus mechanistically uncouple pathologic T cell EGFR signaling from regenerative
epithelial EGFR signaling to enable rational design of novel therapies for protecting tissues from immune-
mediated damage and promoting epithelial regeneration. In collaboration with a team of experts in Areg/EGFR
biology, organoid culture systems, autoimmunity, and mucosal immunology, this project will yield a mechanistic
understanding of fundamental properties of EGFR function within the immune system and the ISC compartment."
10981572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Environmental sensing is at the basis of an organism's ability to adapt its physiology to respond to changes in
its niche. Over the past years, it has emerged that bacteria not only perceive and respond to chemical stimuli,
but are capable of sensing and processing physical forces as an environmental cue. In the case of bacterial
pathogens, we and others have shown that mechanical stimuli can act as a hallmark of host colonization and
lead to activation of virulence genes. Despite this realisation, our mechanistic understanding of pathways and
systems involved in mechanosensing, transduction and processing of physical forces is currently limited, as is
our knowledge regarding the role of mechanoregulation within the host environment. Over the course of this
grant, we have made important discoveries regarding the mechanistic basis of mechanoregulation in the human
pathogen enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). In the human host, ingestion of EHEC can lead to enterocolitis and
severe complications such as haemolytic uremic syndrome. These hallmarks of infection are caused by the
concerted action of virulence factors, including colonization factors and Shiga toxins. We discovered that the
transcriptional regulator GrlA regulates the LEE pathogenicity island encoded type 3 secretion system, an
important colonization factor, in response to mechanical cues. We showed that GrlA is regulated by subcellular
compartmentalisation, and is sequestered on the inner membrane in resting cells. When activated by shear force
GrlA dissociates from the membrane and is released into the cytoplasm, where it binds and induces the LEE
masterregulator Ler. We also showed the biochemical basis for this mechanism, by identifying both constitutively
active GrlA variants, and variants that are `blind' to mechanical cues. Regarding the interplay between intestinal
motility and EHEC infection, we have identified Shiga toxin 2 as an effector that leads to enteric nervous system
stimulation and increased gut transit. We discovered that the Shiga toxin 2-converting phage, but not Shiga toxin
1 is also subject to mechanical induction via GrlA. In this competing renewal application, we will (1) determine
the mechanistic basis for the observed mechanoregulation of Shiga toxin and the toxin encoding phage, (2)
characterize Shiga toxin induction in vivo and its impact on gastrointestinal motility, and (3) define the role of
Shiga toxin during competition of EHEC with the endogenous microbiota. This work will reveal an alternative
regulatory mechanism for a phage-encoded toxin, and define the role of Shiga toxin during bacterial colonization
and inter-species competition in the host niche.

10981571,"The long-term goal of this project is to understand the molecular networks through which
hormones, environmental signals, and nutrients together control plant growth and development. As
sessile organisms, plants have evolved complex and robust cellular signaling systems to regulate
growth and metabolism according to internal status and environmental conditions. Dissecting these
plant regulatory systems not only is important for crop resilience and food security but also can
improve human health, as many signaling mechanisms are highly conserved in plants, humans,
and human parasites. This research project aims to dissect the cellular signaling and regulatory
networks that integrate hormonal, metabolic, and environmental signals. To gain a comprehensive
understanding of the complex system, we integrate a broad range of research approaches
including genetics, genomics, proteomics, structural biology, cell biology, and chemical proteomic
approaches. We also use both muti-cellular and single-cellular model systems (Arabidopsis and
Chlamydomonas) to gain insight into the conserved mechanisms such as cell cycle regulation and
the evolution of inter-cellular signaling mechanisms underlying cell-cell communication,
development, and morphogenesis. In the past two decades, we have elucidated molecular
mechanisms by which the brassinosteroid (BR) hormone acts through the cell surface receptor
kinase BRI1 and its downstream phosphorylation cascade to regulate gene expression and plant
growth, cross-talks with other signaling pathways to regulate development and environmental
responses, and intersects with sugar-signaling pathways to optimize growth and acclimation. We
have also discovered signaling mechanisms that regulate cell division, elongation, differentiation,
and innate immunity. Furthermore, we have recently generated proteomic maps of the
nutrient/sugar-sensing O-glycosylation (O-GlcNAc and O-fucose) pathways and discovered their
convergence with the BR-regulated phosphorylation pathway. Our research elucidates a signal-
processing network that controls plant growth according to nutrient/sugar availability, hormonal
instructions, and environmental cues, and increases our molecular insight into signaling
mechanisms involving protein-protein interactions and protein modifications by phosphorylation
and glycosylation. We focus on proteins that are conserved in humans or human parasites, and
thus our research also informs medical research. Our research will benefit human well-being by
improving food security, environmental sustainability, and drug development/discovery."

Although the results of many studies suggest that urban greenspaces have conducive effects of health, from
extant data it is difficult to isolate causal links or to identify the environmental and physiological processes that
contribute to the health-promoting effect of greenery. A better understanding and assessment of the health
effects of urban greenness is, therefore, needed to optimize its public health impact. To examine the effects of
greenness directly, we initiated the Green Heart Project, which is a community based clinical trial to test the
hypothesis that increasing neighborhood greenery diminishes the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) by
decreasing the levels of local air pollutants. In the first phase of the phase of the project, we acquired baseline
data on neighborhood characteristics and community health from 8 control (C) and 8 adjacent target (T) clusters
of neighborhoods in Louisville, KY. We acquired aerial hyperspectral and LiDAR scans of the area and conducted
stationary and mobile monitoring to develop high-resolution maps of local air pollution. We conducted in-person
exams to acquire baseline physical and psychosocial data. After acquiring baseline data, we planted mostly
evergreen mature trees, and upon completion of planting, we evaluated changes in pollution and reacquired
health data from in-person exams. We now plan to conduct follow-up studies to determine the long-term effects
of the greening intervention on the levels of air pollutants and the health of individuals living in the neighborhood.
For this, we assess CVD risk and psychosocial characteristics, and collect biospecimens from the cohort every
2 years for the next 4 years to quantify the impact of changes in greenery and greenness-related neighborhood
characteristics on differences in cardiovascular health. Using high-resolution hyperspectral and LiDAR imagery,
we will determine the effects of the greening intervention on neighborhood greenery and measure changes in
air pollution, temperature, and noise to evaluate whether the healthful effects of greenery are related to positive
changes in neighborhood characteristics. To ensure sustainability, we will identify barriers and facilitators,
including how urban greenness is perceived, used, and maintained, and estimate the ecosystem services
provided by the increase in greenery. Successful completion of the project will lead to a rigorous and direct
evaluation of the link between greenspaces and cardiovascular health. Findings of the project will help delineate
the contribution of environmental, psychological, social, and physical factors to the beneficial effects of greenery
and guide the development of new strategies for increasing sustainable healthfulness of urban neighborhoods.
By evaluating the impact of greenness on pollution and temperature, the project could provide new insights into
mitigating the effects of climate change. Lessons learned from implementation and sustainability and long-term
cost-benefit analyses of the greening intervention could inform the development of large-scale environmental
interventions to promote community health. Collectively, these results could inform new public health policies,
and facilitate evidence-based optimization of ongoing greening efforts worldwide."

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a multifactorial chronic, debilitating, inflammatory skin disorder
characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scar formation in intertriginous
skin. Most HS patients experience low quality of life likely due to the associated pain, disease
severity, comorbidity conditions, and psychological discomfort. HS affects all races; however, sex
and racial disparities exist with a female to male ratio about 3:1 and increased prevalence,
severity, and dermatologic care in African American and Hispanic/Latino patients compared to
White patients. Despite these differences, contributing factors to these disparities in HS are
largely understudied. Although multiple studies have provided evidence of genetic contribution to
HS, only one genome-wide association study of HS susceptibility has been published, creating a
gap in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of HS. Our main hypotheses are as follows: germline
variation contributes to HS risk in African American, Hispanic/Latino, and White patients; ancestral
differences in genetic risk loci likely account for the racial disparity in HS risk; and sex-specific
genetic risk loci partially influence the sex disparity in HS. We will use whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) to comprehensively assess the associations of rare and common genetic variants across
the genome with HS. We will leverage data from our unique cohorts and other existing genetic
resources including the All of Us WGS data to test our hypothesis through the following specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will perform WGS analysis of HS in African American, Hispanic/Latino, and
White individuals via single-variant and rare-variant burden association tests for each population.
We will determine the effect of genetic ancestries on HS risk and identify the variation in regional
chromosomal ancestries associated with HS in admixed individuals (African Americans and
Hispanic/Latino Americans) via admixture mapping. In Aim 2 we will conduct trans-ethnic meta-
analyses of WGS data to identify both shared and population-specific genetic risk loci and
determine whether HS-associated variants are shared between females and males or sex
specific. In Aim 3, we will seek to identify cell-specific immune related genetic loci, and through
comprehensive multi-omics analysis identify functionally relevant variants to be validated
mechanistically. Successful completion of this proposal will provide insights into the genetic
contributions to risk of HS, including mechanistic exploration of the genes identified that will lead
to the development of new therapeutic targets and treatments in HS."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) are prevalent and costly, with no
disease-modifying therapies. Emerging data demonstrate that disruptions within inhibitory
interneurons contribute significantly to AD/ADRD pathophysiology. Interneurons normally
regulate excitatory firing of neuronal networks, enabling the tuning and adaptability of circuits
which subserve functions such as memory and cognition. Altered interneuron inhibition is seen
in brains of human AD/ADRD subjects, which leads to hyperexcitability, hypersynchrony, and
epileptiform activity that impairs memory and cognition. Synaptic overactivity also increases
amyloid beta (Aβ) levels, while enhancing interneuron inhibitory activity promotes Aβ clearance.
Yet, the upstream causes of interneuron dysfunction in AD/ADRD are unclear. There is a critical
need to define mechanisms of interneuron pathology and the resultant hyperexcitability in
AD/ADRD to develop effective therapies. This proposal will catalog mediators of interneuron
dysfunction, and develop strategies to reverse this pathology. Our central hypothesis is that
abnormal mitochondrial function is a major and early contributor to interneuron dysfunction, and
that transplantation of iPSC-derived interneuron precursors will restore cognitive and memory
circuits. Our rationale is that, by defining faulty interneuron biology and connections, concrete
therapeutic targets will be made feasible for AD/ADRD. We have three Aims. Aim 1 will identify
disrupted interneuron gene expression by studying interneurons within hippocampal and cortical
subregions of human post-mortem AD brain. Using a spatial transcriptomic whole transcriptome
approach, we will map aberrant interneuron genes and identify mechanistic targets for reversing
hyperexcitability and restoring cognitive function. Aim 2 will define inhibitory dysfunction in vitro
by characterizing AD-derived induced interneurons using metabolic phenotyping,
immunocytochemical staining, and Aβ toxicity assays. AD-derived interneurons will then be
modified to express genes aimed at reversing abnormalities seen in prior studies with the goal
of restoring interneuron regulatory physiology. This aim will determine whether corrected
interneurons represent a viable patient-specific therapeutic strategy. Aim 3 will transplant
healthy induced interneurons into hippocampal structures of an AD mouse model, assessing
graft survival and hippocampal-based memory performance. Here, we will determine the impact
of interneuron augmentation on behavior and neurodegeneration in vivo, providing a rationale
for future cell-based therapies. Overall, understanding interneuron pathophysiology and its
contribution to neural circuit dysregulation in AD/ADRD will help uncover innovative treatments
for AD/ADRD and similar illnesses involving dysregulated neural networks."
10985944,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that drive cancer metastasis through paracrine
and autocrine signaling. While the role of specific exosome cargoes in this process is not well
understood, integrin adhesion receptors have been shown to be involved in the choice of
metastatic site. How this occurs is not entirely clear, but could involve binding of exosome-
carried integrins to cognate extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands in distant tissues. Another non-
exclusive possibility is that exosomal integrins and other adhesion receptors directly initiate
assembly of ECM to allow cancer cell survival and invasion at primary tumor sites and
colonization of distant metastatic sites. We will investigate these possible functions of
exosomes in breast cancer metastasis.
 In the prior grant cycle, we identified fundamental mechanisms by which both cancer-
and stromal-derived exosomes control tumor aggressiveness, including: 1) autocrine promotion
of cancer cell migration; 2) fibroblast exosomes are necessary and sufficient to induce assembly
of fibronectin and other stromal matrix proteins, both in vitro and in vivo; 3) and fibroblast-
secreted exosomes promote both growth and metastasis of primary breast tumors. In addition,
we find that adhesion receptors are enriched on small EVs from both cancer cells and
fibroblasts. Based on these other findings, we propose the central hypothesis that adhesion
molecules carried by breast cancer and fibroblast exosomes drive multiple steps of the
metastatic cascade. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that clustering of
integrins and syndecans within exosomes mediates fibronectin (FN) assembly; 2) Test the
hypothesis that breast cancer cell exosomes carry unique adhesion molecules that can induce
assembly of epithelial-type ECM; 3) Determine the role of exosomal adhesion receptors in
promoting breast cancer metastasis."
10990281,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The role of germline genetic variation and viral infection in development and progression has been studied
extensively in adult tumors and autoimmune disease. Less attention has been paid to the interaction of these
factors with birth defects and pediatric malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which in the
youngest patients is driven almost exclusively by structural variants (SVs) with poorly understood etiology. The
prevalence of gene fusion transcripts associated with leukemia at live birth is 10x to 100x greater than the
incidence of childhood leukemia, which suggests other risk factors must interact with SVs. One possible
candidate for interaction is the presence of germline mutations, and preliminary analysis has shown that patients
harboring SVs are enriched for germline mutations in genes responsible for DNA double-stranded break repair.
Another candidate is the timing of viral infection in genetically-predisposed individuals. Clinical trials of gene
therapy with viral vectors failed in part due to viral integrations activating oncogenes such as MECOM. Recent
work has shown a direct mechanism for derivative chromosome formation at the most common breakpoints in
leukemia, and human herpesviruses, including CMV, are one of the single greatest risk factors for chromosomal
birth defects. Additionally, germline and somatic copy number and short sequence variants have been
documented affecting e26 transformation specific (ETS) factors, which participate in high-risk gene fusions seen
in both solid and liquid tumors. These factors and their binding sites determine developmental fates across
tissues, yet their motifs are short tandem repeats -- the single most variable class of features in the human
genome. Small changes in dosage, as created by disruptions in binding site motifs or variation in ramp
sequences, may be sufficient to predispose individuals to disease. The primary obstacle to studying these
mechanisms has long been the small sample sizes and biased coverage of cohorts assembled for rare and
childhood diseases. The vast quantity of whole-genome, whole-transcriptome, and long-read sequencing data
provided by the Gabriella Miller Kids First! (GMKF) Consortium, Therapeutically Applicable Research to
Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET), and the X01 Long Read Pilot Project for omics-cold pediatric
leukemia patients, and others negate this obstacle. I posit that both the computational infrastructure and the
sample sizes required to address this urgent need are now in place, allowing us to determine if predisposition
risk can be mitigated by screening or prophylaxis. The overall goal of my F99 training phase is to characterize
germline variants and perform functional validation of variants in a zebrafish model of high-risk pediatric
AML. During my K00 phase, I propose to characterize germline regulatory, splicing, structural variants,
and viral genomic integrations as catalysts of risk for leukemia. The training and data resulting from this
fellowship award will establish the foundation of scientific and professional skills for my career as an independent
researcher."
10990627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive deadly disease with no cure. Despite recent therapeutic
advances, the prognosis of patients with PAH remains poor. The key pathological feature of PAH is an inward
remodeling of small pulmonary arteries (PA) due to, at least in part, increased proliferation and decreased cell
death (apoptosis) of pulmonary arterial vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMC). This leads to obliteration of
the PA lumen, elevated PA pressure, and death due to right heart failure. The mechanisms driving PAVSMC
hyper-proliferation/survival and PA remodeling in PAH are not fully understood, and new potential anti-
proliferative molecular targets are urgently needed to develop effective remodeling-focused therapies to reverse
this deadly disease. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is an important regulator of cell
proliferation and survival, dysregulation of which is linked with various proliferative disorders, including cancer.
However, the status, role, mechanisms of regulation and function, and potential therapeutic attractiveness of
HIPK2 to modulate PAVSMC proliferation, remodeling and PAH had never been studied. Our preliminary data
show that HIPK2 is over-expressed in medial layer of small remodeled PAs and in hyper-proliferative, apoptosis-
resistant PAVSMC from human PAH lungs and its overexpression is required for abnormal cell proliferation and
survival. We found that HIPK2 acts through the up-regulation of pro-proliferative/pro-survival transcriptional co-
activators YAP/TAZ and regulator of cytokinesis centrosomal protein 55 (CEP55), which, in turn, up-regulates
Akt. Importantly, pharmacological targeting of HIPK2 reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in human PAH
PAVSMC, and attenuated experimental PH in mice, strongly suggesting the important role of HIPK2 as a driver
of PAVSMC hyper-proliferation and survival in PAH and the potential attractiveness of HIPK2 as a remodeling-
focused target for therapeutic intervention. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that HIPK2 is up-regulated
in PAH PAVSMC, leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling and PH, and that pharmacological targeting of
HIPK2 suppresses PAVSMC proliferation, induces apoptosis, re-remodels PAs and reverses or attenuates
existing PH. Specifically, we will (1) determine the status and role of HIPK2 in PAVSMC proliferation, survival,
remodeling and PH using de-identified lung tissues and PAVSMC fromPAH and non-diseased subjects (in vitro)
and transgenic mice with conditional SM-specific Hipk2 knockout (in vivo); (2) evaluate the mechanisms of HIPK2
(up)regulation in PAH PAVSMC and dissect the interrelations within the HIPK2-YAP/TAZ-CEP55-Akt axis; (3)
test whether pharmacological inhibition of HIPK2 selectively suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in
vitro in human PAH PAVSMC, and reverses or attenuates experimental pulmonary vascular remodeling and
overall PH in rats in vivo. If successful, the proposedstudy will define the function of HIPK2 in growth, proliferation
and survival of PAH PAVSMC, identify main signaling pathways regulated by HIPK2, and evaluate attractiveness
of HIPK2 as a new potential molecular target for development of novel anti-proliferative therapies for PAH."
10990629,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains uncurable. The complex, and diverse, neuropathology suggests that AD may
actually represent not a single disease, but a family of diseases that share plaque and tangle neuropathology.
The overall modest effects and variability among patients' response to the recent FDA approved drugs for the
treatment of AD highlight potential disease heterogeneity among study subjects. The high heterogeneity of AD
has also been strongly supported by the recent discovery of three major molecular subtypes of AD, each
possessing distinctive molecular signatures. The therapeutic strategy, referred to as “senolytics,” has gained
immense research attention for its hope to improve various age-associated conditions, including AD and related
dementias (ADRD), by pharmacologically removing senescent cells in the brain. Based on our preliminary
findings, there is compelling evidence indicating that senescence exhibits distinct characteristics in the major
molecular subtypes of AD. In this application, we propose to systematically investigate the molecular
mechanisms of brain senescence in different molecular subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for discovery of
novel targets and therapeutics for AD. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team of leading
scientists with expertise across translational Sen biology, neuropathology, bioinformatics, systems biology,
machine learning and artificial intelligence. We have successfully piloted, and here will deploy, a Sen multi-Omics
(senomic) pipeline to define
a
scale
molecular
the holistic cellular, molecular and chemical phenotypes of Sen cells in brains from
large number of AD and control subjects. In this project, we will systematically analyze all the existing large-
 single cell RNA-seq and multiome data in AD to identify and characterize senescent cells in major
subtypes of AD. We willvalidate key findings using single-cell multi-Omics and spatial transcriptomics
and imaging in which the entire human transcriptome can be profiled in single cells while maintaining spatial and
multi-scale resolution. Using our unique pipeline, we are very well positioned to characterize and quantify the
molecular heterogeneity of Sen cells in different AD subtypes. Our iterative approach involves profiling intact
tissues by 10xGenomics Visium and NanoString GeoMx and CosMx platforms as well as disaggregated cells by
single nucleus multi-Omics (RNA-seq and ATAC-seq). Results will provide a spatially resolved, comprehensive
molecular portrait of both chromatin accessibility, gene and protein expression in the hippocampus in AD in
contrast with healthy control. Our methodologies are non-destructive allowing for mapping multi-analytes back
to the tissues to determine cellular morphology and neighborhood environment. We will further develop novel
therapeutics against brain senescence in AD through cutting edge drug repositioning approaches. Key driver
genes and candidate drugs will be validated through extensive in vivo experiments. The data and the analytic
and experimental tools will be shared with the community for broader investigations."

cells for efficient mounting of humoral responses. The encapsulated genetic material can also stimulate B cells
through the Toll-like receptors. Substantial mechanistic studies at the single-molecule level and imaging of live
cells have revealed the sensitivity of B cells to the density of antigens. However, at the mechanistic level, it
remains largely uncharacterized how B cells may recognize and respond to the individual as well as collective
attributes of a virus, including the spatial density of proteins and the internal nucleic acids. To this end, we have
developed a new system of synthetic virus-like structures (SVLS), and we are using these structures as a new
generation of virus-like immunogens to study both in vitro and in vivo fundamental mechanisms of B cell antiviral
responses. This project aims to unravel the acute and long-term antiviral antibody responses using this new
generation of model particulate antigens that we have developed and train the next generation biomedical and
pharmaceutical sciences workforce. The success of this project will yield new and important mechanistic
information on the initiation and maintenance of neutralizing antiviral antibody responses in mice, and prepare
the trainee for his long-term scientific and professional career."

Previous studies in World Trade Center (WTC)-exposed rescue/recovery workers have shown links between
WTC dust cloud exposure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. Exposure to ambient particulate
matter has been associated with CVD in other occupational cohorts as well. Among WTC rescue/recovery
workers, those considered to have high-level WTC dust exposure, such as those who arrived at the WTC site
early in the rescue/recovery effort on 9/11/2001 (9/11), have been shown to have an increased risk of CVD
compared with workers with lower exposure. However, findings have been inconsistent, with some studies only
finding associations within WTC-exposed sub-populations. Inconsistent results from studies of WTC exposure
and CVD-related outcomes could be due to the use of varying definitions of CVD and high-level WTC
exposure. Now, we propose to evaluate the association between WTC exposure and CVD outcomes within a
large cohort of WTC rescue/recovery workers, using a consistent exposure definition and medical record data
from a centralized New York State database. The goal of this proposal is to estimate the overall incidence of
CVD events, defined by inpatient and outpatient New York State healthcare facility visits, in the Combined
WTC Rescue/Recovery Cohort; in particular, we aim to compare CVD incidence by WTC exposure level and
by occupation at the WTC site, and evaluate whether the CVD incidence changes over time. If an exposure-
response relationship is found, results from this proposal would provide the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) WTC Health Program with additional evidence to consider in their deliberations as
to whether CVD should be added to the list of WTC-covered conditions."
10995108,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cannabis use (CU) to manage mental health symptoms is increasing in both clinical and recreational contexts,
particularly among young adults. This emerging trend reflects evolving attitudes surrounding cannabis and
underlines a need to evaluate the physical, psychological, and sociocultural factors involved. The present
study examines how cognitive processes related to decision-making (i.e., reward motivation and inhibitory
control) relate to CU during emerging adulthood (age 18-25) – a crucial developmental period – following a
potentially traumatic event. We hypothesize that disruptions to these decisional processes post-trauma drive
alterations to CU that result in a mutually reinforcing behavioral pattern whereby pleasurable sensations from
CU in the short-term result in lowered hedonic tone overall and long-term adverse cannabis-related outcomes
(i.e., cannabis use disorder, greater frequency/quantity of use, cannabis-related problems). The present study
leverages methodological advantages of the parent study (R01DA054116; e.g., psychophysiological
measurement, ecological momentary assessment, wearable biosensors, longitudinal follow-ups) and
implements additional objective measures of cognitive processes related to discrete choice behavior.
Specifically, the present project will recruit 70 participants from the parent project, add two baseline self-report
measures of hedonic tone and impulsivity, and add two behavioral tasks assessing reward motivation and
inhibitory control at two study timepoints – 2-weeks post-trauma and 6-months post-trauma. The present study
will use sequential sampling modeling (SSM), which unites trial-level data from behavioral tasks with
physiological data to derive inferences into latent decision-making processes that cannot be inferred by group
averages. We will develop computational models of these behavioral tasks using SSM and integrate
parameters derived from them into intensive longitudinal analyses to evaluate cognitive mechanisms
underlying the relationship between psychobiological trauma reactivity and CU. Specifically, we will assess
relationships between traumatic stress reactivity, reward motivation, and inhibitory control (Aim 1); detect how
decisional processes and CU are affected by fluctuations in psychophysiology and hedonic tone (Aim 2); and
evaluate psychophysiological and behavioral markers of the developmental trajectories of problematic CU
following trauma (Aim 3). Through this National Research Service Award, the PI will further develop and refine
his program of research to integrate naturalistic behavioral and physiological observations with advanced
quantitative modeling which will lead to both crucial scientific insights in the short-term and set the stage for
future studies. This project will be conducted within an individualized training program to facilitate the
acquisition of key skills and knowledge progress toward career goals. This includes advanced didactic and
experiential training in (1) EMA methodology, (2) behavioral task implementation, (3) computational modeling,
(4) advanced analysis of intensive longitudinal data, and (5) grantsmanship and manuscript preparation."
10995237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age is a major risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with the incidence of PDAC rising
sharply with increasing age. Most PDAC cases occur in individuals who are over the age of 60, and the risk
continues to increase with each decade of life. The median age at diagnosis and death for PDAC is around 70
and 72 years old, respectively. Although PDAC can occur at any age, it is relatively rare in younger individuals,
and it is uncommon for people under the age of 40 to develop PDAC. It is not clear why age is a significant risk
factor for PDAC but like other age-associated cancers there are likely multiple variables at play. Like other
diseases, we use sophisticated mouse models to study PDAC, but none have been used to address the impact
of aging on disease initiation or progression. This proposal is based on our preliminary data demonstrating that
PDAC progression is accelerated in old animals. We have found that increased organismal age significantly
enhances the growth of primary PDAC tumors and increases metastasis. Remarkably, we find that the immune
landscape is vastly different in tumors generated in young versus old animals, and that intratumoral desmoplasia
is heightened with age. Our findings are in line with the established prominence and importance of the PDAC
tumor stroma in tumor progression and suggest that aging substantially affects the functional characteristics of
the stromal cells. Most of the stromal cells within a PDAC tumor are cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and
how the functionality of these CAFs changes with age is totally unexplored. Moreover, whether other aspects of
PDAC biology, such as tumor initiation, are affected by age remains an unanswered question. Based on our
preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that age plays a critical role in PDAC by accelerating tumor initiation
and progression. In this proposal, we will 1) examine the influence of the aging stroma on tumor growth and
progression, and 2) investigate the impact of age on the intrinsic oncogenic potential of the pancreas. This project
will be of great significance, novelty, and impact, as it will constitute the first evaluation of the impact of aging on
PDAC initiation and progression. Our work will establish new paradigms for the study of PDAC, and will set the
framework for evaluating potential PDAC therapies from a patient-centric perspective."
10994834,"Abstract
Severe respiratory viral infections pose a significant risk and can result in debilitating lung diseases such as
acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis, which are prominent contributors to
global mortality. During severe respiratory viral injury, the lung initiates a distinct form of regeneration that is
independent of the functional regeneration facilitated by distal epithelial progenitors. This secondary ""dysplastic""
mode of regeneration involves the activation of p63+ basal progenitor cells in the upper airways, followed by the
upregulation of Krt5, expansion, and migration into the alveoli, ultimately resulting in ectopic bronchiolization of
the alveolar epithelium. This dysplastic response is postulated to provide short-term benefits by restoring the
epithelial barrier; however, it ultimately results in a reduction of the total functional gas-exchanging surface area
of the lung. Ectopic Krt5+ cells are consistently observed in cases of both severe viral lung injury and pulmonary
fibrosis but have specifically been found to be strongly associated with fibrotic regions of the lung in cases of
pulmonary fibrosis. However, their specific involvement in fibrosis following viral injury and the underlying
mechanisms facilitating their ectopic migration from the proximal to distal airways remains poorly understood. In
my preliminary data, I observed a significant upregulation of canonical NF-κB transcription factors RelA, Nfkb1,
and c-Rel in ectopic Krt5+ cells. The NF-κB pathway is a well-known pro-inflammatory signaling pathway, and its
activation has been shown to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, migration, and proliferation. Aim 1 of
this proposal will assess whether canonical NF-κB signaling is necessary for ectopic Krt5+ cell expansion and
migration by utilizing a conditional deletion of IKKβ in p63+ progenitor cells. In vivo experiments will determine
the impact of IKKβ deletion on the total quantity of dysplastic Krt5+ epithelium following influenza injury through
immunofluorescent imaging and qPCR. Accompanying in vitro experiments will assess the specific migratory
and proliferative phenotypes associated with the loss of NF-κB signaling through in vitro gap closure and EdU
incorporation assays. Additional preliminary data revealed that ectopic Krt5+ cells highly express CTGF, a known
secreted pro-fibrotic growth factor, and are surrounded by more Collagen 1 compared to less-injured regions
following H1N1-induced lung injury. Aim 2 of this study will utilize a conditional deletion of CTGF and various
metrics, including immunofluorescence and hydroxyproline content, to determine whether CTGF is necessary
for the pro-fibrotic function of ectopic Krt5+ cells in vivo. Subsequently, we will elucidate the direct paracrine effect
of ectopic Krt5+ cells on fibroblast extracellular matrix deposition in vitro by culturing fibroblasts in conditioned
media from Krt5+ cells +/- CTGF and quantifying changes in matrix deposition. These experiments will investigate
the role of NF-κB signaling in dysplastic remodeling and the pro-fibrotic function of ectopic Krt5+ cells, thereby
providing insight into the underlying mechanisms governing their migration and fibrotic pathology."

The GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion at the C9orf72 locus is the most common genetic
cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the related neurodegenerative disorder, frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). Documented cellular defects associated with the C9orf72 mutation include loss-of-function
through haploinsufficiency, RNA foci triggered by the C9orf72 transcript variants containing G4C2 repeats, and
the accumulation of toxic dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Currently, there is no effective treatment due to the
complex etiology. However, not all C9orf72 mutant carriers develop ALS or FTD, suggesting that other factors
modify the disease onset and progression. Twin studies have estimated that epigenetic factors contribute
about 40% of risk to develop ALS/FTD. DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism that enables
our genome to integrate extrinsic signals, and dysregulation of DNA methylation plays important roles in
disease onset and progression. Interestingly, hypermethylation of the G4C2 repeats and the CpG islands
(CGIs) flanking G4C2 in the C9orf72 promoter were observed in C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients, suggesting a
pathological role for DNA methylation. We hypothesize that the methylation of G4C2 repeats and two CGIs
represents a critical factor in determining the onset and progression of signs and symptoms of ALS/FTD in
C9orf72 mutant carriers. To test this hypothesis, we will apply our DNA methylation editing tool
(CRISPR/dCas9-TET1/DNMT3) to manipulate these methylation events in motor neurons derived from
C9orf72 ALS iPSCs and cortical neurons derived from C9orf72 FTD iPSCs as well as in transgenic mice
carrying a human C9orf72 mutant bacterial artificial chromosome, and then phenotypically characterize the
methylation-edited neurons and mice. Precise editing of CGIs and G4C2 methylations will evaluate the
functional significance of these epigenetic events during the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS/FTD and
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of editing methylation for the most commonly known cause of ALS/FTD.
To identify epigenetic factors that modify the disease onset of C9orf72 mutant carriers, we will compare the
disease-affected and non-affected brain regions by single-cell DNA methylation and RNA sequencing of motor
and prefrontal cortex samples from the same C9orf72 mutant carriers diagnosed with ALS or FTD. We will also
compare the methylome and transcriptome of motor neurons converted directly from the skin fibroblasts of the
same C9orf72 ALS patients at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. These comparisons between the
disease-affected and non-affected brain regions and the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic neurons will
determine whether the DNA methylation of CGIs and/or G4C2 is an epigenetic factor modifying the onset of
C9orf72 ALS or FTD. Additionally, these comparisons will identify other novel DNA methylation and
transcriptional events contributing to the disease onset in C9ofr72 mutant carriers, thus guiding the future study
of these factors protective against the development of ALS or FTD in C9orf72 mutant carriers."

The long-term goal of this technology development is to improve the clinical utility of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI)
for presurgical and intra-operative mapping of resting state networks (RSNs) by developing an analysis tool
that can be seamlessly integrated into the presurgical and intra-operative workflow. RsfMRI is a rapidly
advancing task-free approach for pre-surgical and intra-operative mapping of RSNs in patients with brain
tumors who have difficulties performing tasks. The technology builds on TurboFIRE, a powerful real-time tfMRI
and rsfMRI analysis software tool for high-speed fMRI, the success of a prior Phase I STTR study in 12 brain
tumor patients that showed clinically acceptable concordance of real-time high-speed multi-echo rsfMRI with
tfMRI, and intra-operative electrocortical stimulation (ECS); and our experience with intra-operative rsfMRI in
anesthetized brain tumor patients. This technology provides online rsfMRI mapping, eliminating time-
consuming postprocessing, and seamless integration into presurgical planning and intra-operative MRI.
The objectives of this phase I STTR effort are (a) to develop a fully automated real-time resting state fMRI
analysis tool that enables online monitoring of data quality and computation of patient specific maps of resting
state connectivity, and (b) assess the performance of this tool for robust presurgical mapping in patients with
brain tumors. The goal is to develop real-time functional brain imaging technology with high sensitivity and
specificity that is competitive with four state-of-the-art offline toolboxes.
The specific aims for Phase II are to (1) develop a real-time rsfMRI analysis tool with online quality control for
intraoperative guidance, (2) Validate the technology for presurgical and intra-operative rsfMRI in patients with
brain tumors (3) Prepare the documents required by CFR 820.30c for FDA 510(k) clearance.
This technology will have significant clinical and commercial potential for a wide range of neurological
and psychiatric applications beyond pre-surgical mapping in patients with brain tumors. It opens up
functional brain mapping to patient populations that have been difficult to study in the past.
Since we submitted the grant application, the FDA-approved offline resting state fMRI analysis tool Quicktome
from Omniscent has become available, which, however, does not offer real-time analysis and thus is not
suitable for intraoperative mapping. This along with the efforts of several companies, including major MRI
manufacturers, who are working on prototypes documents the increasing market needs for resting state fMRI.
We have an operational TurboFIRE prototype that was used in two recent feasibility studies in patients with
brain tumors. (A) We carried out a feasibility study on non-stationarity of resting-state connectivity in patients
with brain tumors in the awake and anesthetized state in preparation for Specific Aim 1b of Phase I and
Specific Aim 1a of Phase II, which was submitted to the 2024 ISMRM Annual Meeting (Fig. 1). (B) We carried

10985288,"Although there has been considerable interest in using remote monitoring in diseases like Parkinson’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, and other Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias, there has been essentially no change
in clinical care. Yet, remote monitoring could radically reduce barriers to care, especially in rural areas – 80% of
rural areas medically underserved. The long-term goal is to use remote monitoring to improve the lives of
people with neurodegenerative causes of dementia. The overall objectives of this application are to identify the
value of wearable devices, automated fine-motor and speech assessments in detecting and measuring
cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. The central hypothesis is that low-cost wearable
devices combined with computer vision and speech analysis can provide useful, holistic assessment of
Parkinson’s disease. The rationale for this project is that remote monitoring can increase the effectiveness of
expert care, alleviating barriers of access and distance in underserved, rural communities. The hypothesis will
be tested with two specific aims: 1) Identify the value of low-cost, holistic assessment for predicting Parkinson’s
disease diagnosis and cognitive impairment and 2) Identify the value of low-cost, holistic assessment for
predicting one-year cognitive, motor progression in Parkinson’s disease. In the first aim, people with possible
Parkinson’s disease will be provided an activity tracker and conduct home-based motor and speech
assessments with the goal of building a classifier to predict the ultimate diagnosis (Parkinson’s disease versus
not Parkinson’s disease) and cognitive status at baseline (normal cognitive, mild cognitive impairment,
dementia). The second aim will build a cohort of people recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and
conduct a 4-week assessment using an activity tracking watch and home-based motor and speech
assessments. The objective will be to improve prediction of cognitive and motor symptoms at 1 year. The
proposed research is innovative because it focuses on using data collection using low-cost, commercially
available devices to construct a holistic measure of both the motor and cognitive manifestations of Parkinson’s
disease. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a low-cost framework useful for
non-expert providers to screen for and evaluate Parkinson’s disease and to provide a more accurate prognosis
for people newly diagnosed. As a career development grant, this proposal is ideal: it builds on the applicant’s
past skills in health economics by adding knowledge of neuroscience, neurodegenerative diseases and
dementia, human subjects, and clinical research – all relatively novel areas for the applicant. The applicant will
accomplish these career development goals through both conducting the proposed research and didactic
instruction in clinical trials, neuroscience, and neuropathology. The applicant’s division and institution are
dedicated to providing the needed support and resources for success and both have outstanding track records
for transforming ESIs into successful, independent, NIH-funded researchers."

Irritability is common in early childhood and declines as children approach middle childhood. Irritability that
persists into middle childhood affects up to 20 percent of youth and is a marker of risk for psychiatric problems.
To date, the study of irritability has focused on personal (e.g., parenting style) and genetic risk factors for
irritability with little attention focused on the contribution of exogenous, environmental factors, such as prenatal
exposures to neurotoxicants. This K23 application presents a research and training plan that will support the
applicant, Dr. Mariah DeSerisy, on a path towards becoming an independent investigator working at the
intersection of child mental health, environmental epidemiology, and neuroimaging. The activities in this
application build on Dr. DeSerisy’s prior training and are set in a resource-rich environment which will allow her
to further develop her skills in: (1) analyzing effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) using advanced
epidemiologic methods, (2) developmentally sensitive, multi-informant/method assessment tools for early
childhood irritability, (3) longitudinal modeling of high-dimensional data using causal inference approaches, (4)
network-based functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data analysis, and (5) ethical
conduct of research with vulnerable populations. By combining MRI and environmental epidemiology, the
current research proposal seeks to test the central hypothesis that prenatal PAH exposure is associated
with persistent irritability via effects on functional connectivity between control and reward circuits.
This training and research program will support the candidate in becoming an independent investigator with
expertise in how environmental (social and chemical) risk factors contribute to the manifestation of adolescent
internalizing symptoms and anxiety/depressive disorders.
RELEVANCE: Air pollution is an understudied, modifiable risk factor for an environmentally-associated
phenotype of persistent childhood irritability. In the short term, this career development award will provide Dr.
DeSerisy with critical training that will prepare her to successfully submit an R01 examining the contributions of
prenatal PAH to adolescent anxiety and depression via persistent irritability in this cohort. Long term, results
may inform public policy messaging and contribute to development of novel intervention and prevention tools."

This proposal aims to characterize the unique effect of recreational cannabis use on sleep in women. Sleep
was once believed to be a quiescent state, where self-reported measures might be sufficient; however,
biomedical technology advances now demonstrate that remarkable, essential biological processing occurs in
the brain and body throughout the night, including characteristic patterning of brain (EEG) and peripheral
(autonomic nervous system, HPA Axis) activity. Yet, the current void of scientific evidence on cannabis has led
to unsubstantiated marketing claims and public endorsement of cannabis as a sleep aid based nearly
exclusively on perceptions of improved sleep. Such claims carry specific health harms for women, whose
cannabis use may interact with a changing physiological context due to increases and decreases in
reproductive hormones. This application, submitted by an interdisciplinary sleep and addiction team, proposes
a 60-day prospective study with a within-subject design of 100 cannabis using, naturally cycling biological
females. It pairs sleep behavior with nocturnal physiology of brain and body systems to deconstruct the
proximal sleep effects of acute cannabis exposure at different phases of the menstrual cycle. Using multigroup
multilevel moderated mediation path analysis, stress-reactivity systems will be characterized as potential
mediators of the cannabis-sleep relationship. Framed through the lens of allostatic theory, this study views
repeated exposure to acute cannabis use episodes as stressors that can ‘pile up’ over time by increasing multi-
organ physiological load. Thus, apparent short-term improvements in sleep from cannabis use come at a cost
of wear and tear on multiple brain/body systems, potentially explaining the persistence of poor sleep outcomes
in individuals seeking treatment for or in recovery from addiction. The three study aims focus on comparing
sleep (self-report, actigraphy and EEG, Aim 1), HPA axis activity (cortisol, Aim 2) and autonomic nervous
system function (ECG, skin conductance, Aim 3) on nights following cannabis use to nights following no
cannabis use. To balance internal and external validity, recreational, non-daily cannabis users will self-
administer cannabis as usual with the exception that they self-purchase cannabis strains within a potency
range from legal state dispensaries and consume it with a cannabis flower vaporizer. Sleep and stress-
reactivity system data will be collected at home using FDA-approved wearable devices and saliva sampling.
Estradiol and progesterone will be assayed and used to distribute testing nights across the menstrual cycle;
menstrual phase will be tested as a moderator in Aims 1-3. This study addresses critical, and currently lacking,
information about women, a population that experiences more negative consequences from cannabis use and
a higher rate of sleep disturbances and disorders, yet has been largely overlooked in biological research due
to the complexity of the menstrual cycle."
10985393,"Obesity is a highly prevalent chronic disease that poses a significant public health risk. Almost 42% of US
adults are affected by obesity with women at higher risk for severe obesity than men (11.5 vs 6.9%). Obesity
has a significant and complex impact on reproduction and is associated with menstrual irregularities,
anovulation, decreased rates of natural pregnancy, miscarriage, and infertility. While there are several known
causes of infertility such as decreased ovarian reserve, male factor, and tubal disease, most require invasive
and expensive procedures to achieve pregnancy, and, unlike obesity, very few are modifiable. Obesity is
commonly associated with anovulation-related causes of infertility but has been shown to impact all levels of
the reproductive axis including the hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary, and endometrium. While there are far fewer
studies on the endometrium than on other tissues, there are data from both human primary cells and mouse
models of obesity that implicate the endometrium in obesity-related infertility, mostly through defects in
endometrial decidualization, the process by which the endometrium prepares itself for implantation in the
luteal-phase of the menstrual cycle. There are two fundamental obstacles that have limited the ability to
understand the link between obesity, endometrial function, and infertility : 1) lack of comprehensive
phenotyping isolating obesity from other co-occurring conditions that impact the endometrium such as PCOS
and 2) reliance solely on BMI to study obesity. While obesity is most often singularly defined as a body mass
index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2, the sole use of BMI to categorize obesity-associated risks fails to consider the
heterogeneity of the disease. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess the impact of obesity and
adiposity as assessed by multiple parameters on the luteal-phase endometrium. We will include a cohort of
extensively-phenotyped women allowing for disentanglement of commonly co-occurring endocrine and
metabolic disorders that have confounded prior studies. We hypothesize that obesity is associated with
modified endometrial transcription and cellular subpopulations resulting in an altered proteomic profile and
aberrant decidualization. To test this hypothesis, in aim 1 we perform single-nuclear sequencing (snRNA-seq)
on endometrial samples from women with and without obesity to comprehensively understand how pathologic
adiposity might influence alterations in cellular populations. In aim 2 we will perform liquid chromatography
mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) to assess for altered proteomic profiles. Finally, in aim 3 we will perform functional
endometrial assays to correlate transcriptomic and proteomic signatures with functional markers of endometrial
dysfunction. These pilot experiments will provide novel insight into the well-known association of obesity with
infertility and early pregnancy loss, guiding planning for large scale validation and mechanistic studies."
10985486,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an intractable disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons
in the substantia nigra, resulting in tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. By the time a clinical
diagnosis is confirmed, a considerable proportion of dopaminergic neurons have degenerated. Gastrointestinal
(GI) dysfunction may be an early manifestation of the disease and the gut may be an unexplored diagnostic
and/or therapeutic target. In response, the Gut Brain Parkinson's Disease Consortium (GBPDC) will build an
annotated repository of biospecimens to allow for the identification, development and validation of innovative
early-phase GI-based diagnostic tools and biomarkers for PD. To support the creation of this valuable resource,
we will develop a Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) that addresses the resource sharing,
data science and analytical challenges unique to this consortium. Our team brings immediate expertise in key
areas of biorepository management, data science and analysis, combined with an operational structure and
guiding principles of the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). Our vision is to employ a team science
approach to establish an innovative, efficient, flexible, and metric driven CDMC designed to support the
establishment of the GBPDC biorepository and accelerate development of innovative early-phase GI-
based diagnostic tools and biomarkers for PD. To achieve our vision, we will establish a program framework
of three Cores: Research and Resources, Data Management, and Biorepository to execute the three main
CDMC functions outlined in our aims: 1) provide program leadership and expertise; assistance in study and
protocol design; and study implementation, monitoring, and management for GBPDC awardees; 2) support the
creation and maintenance of a harmonized GBPDC data and research ecosystem; facilitate compliant and
seamless data sharing and dissemination; 3) provide scientific and laboratory expertise and leadership to
coordinate the receipt, processing, storage, and distribution of biospecimens. The Cores will be supported by
the Web-based Activities and Dissemination Program Core that will ensure a rich research communication plan
to facilitate the sharing of resources with the internal consortium and broader scientific communities. Our
proposed CDMC will establish the required functions to efficiently support the establishment of the GBPDC
program with a focus on expanded reach, efficiency, and accelerated data analysis and result dissemination.
This program is possible because of the unparalleled breadth of complementary services and expertise offered
by our collaborative team."
10990770,"Our proposed research focuses on defining the mechanism of action of the TlpC chemoreceptor in modulating
colonization and pathogenesis of the ulcer-causing bacterium Helicobacter pylori. TlpC plays important and
exciting roles in H. pylori pathogenesis, sensing host lactate and allowing H. pylori to use it to resist a previ-
ously-unappreciated innate immune challenge, complement. The central tenet that guides this work is that un-
derstanding chemotaxis signals will lend new insight into the nature of host-pathogen interactions. A gap re-
mains, however in our understanding of how H. pylori uses lactate to promote complement resistance, how
TlpC integrates lactate and other ligand sensing, and how and where TlpC-mediated sensing promotes in vivo
growth. Continued existence of this gap prevents us from gaining a full understanding of H. pylori’s pathogenic
mechanisms and, in the long term, creating new drugs to thwart these processes. Millions of people worldwide
and in the U.S. are infected by H. pylori and suffer from its associated diseases—ulcers and gastric cancer.
Gastric cancer is the fourth highest cause of cancer deaths worldwide. H. pylori is here to stay based on recent
studies that show H. pylori incidence has stabilized in the developed world. Furthermore, current therapies to
cure H. pylori infection fail with unacceptable frequency, e.g., recent estimates in the United States have found
that 20-25% of infected individuals are not cured by the current therapeutic regime. New drug targets are des-
perately needed. The specific objective of this application is to dissect TlpC signal transduction and the role of
it and its sensed compounds in gastric colonization and disease. Our central hypothesis is that the TlpC-
sensed compounds play fundamental roles in H. pylori colonization, and are sensed cooperatively using both
subdomains of TlpC’s dCACHE ligand binding domain structure. Our hypothesis has been formulated from
preliminary data using crystallization of TlpC, analyzing H. pylori ’s response to lactate and host complement,
and determining the role of chemotaxis and TlpC in vivo. Our approach has three Aims, which combine H. py-
lori molecular biology, mouse models, and high resolution protein crystallography. In Aim 1, we dissect the role
of lactate in H. pylori colonization including how it promotes growth and complement resistance. In Aim 2, we
determine how H. pylori TlpC integrates information from multiple ligands into a chemotaxis response. In Aim
3, we define how chemotaxis underlies in vivo population control. The proposed research is innovative in that it
will create new knowledge about the functions of chemotaxis during bacterial pathogenesis, the role of comple-
ment in the stomach, and high resolution information about how dCACHE ligand binding domains bind ligands.
The proposed research is significant because both in our understanding of H. pylori pathogenesis but also for
advancing our understanding of dCACHE ligand binding domains, the most common bacterial sensing module.
The long-term outcomes generated by this research are likely to provide insights that will enable creation of
new drugs against H. pylori-related disease."

specific therapy for this disease. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been discovered that have shown ability
to protect; however, their limited protective breadth are a liability.
Objectives: The premise of this grant is that the humoral response raised against natural CCHF infection in
humans leads to antibody responses that can be protective. The hypothesis is that cross-protective anti-
CCHFV mAbs can be found and isolated from humans. We have data demonstrating that mouse monoclonal
antibodies can be protective, and have isolated GP38 and GC mAbs from humans. The specific aims of this
proposal are 1) Develop a cohort of CCHF survivors and isolate a panel of monoclonal antibodies against
CCHFV envelope subjects with broad responses to Gc, Gn, and/or GP38. 2) Test the efficacy of anti-CCHFV
envelope mAbs for their ability for cross-clade protection in a lethal mouse model. 3) Define the fine specificity
of the broadly protective human mAb(s) against CCHFV.
Methods: We will develop a cohort, analyze blood samples from 120 CCHF survivors in Turkey, and identify
the patients with the broadest breadth and neutralization, and undertake a detailed isolation and
characterization of up to 75 anti-CCHFV glycoprotein antibodies. Nine antibodies will then be selected for
sequential efficacy testing in the IFNAR-/- mouse model in up to five separate strains representing different
clades to identify broadly cross-protective mAbs. Four cross-protective mAbs will be chosen for fine epitope
mapping. Monoclonal antibodies in complex with a variety of CCHFV antigens will undergo x-ray
crystallography and cryo-EM.
Impact: If our hypothesis proves correct, the isolation of human monoclonal antibodies that are cross-protective
will represent a breakthrough, and will be candidates for further pre-clinical and clinical testing. In addition, the
identification of an epitope would have implications for vaccine design against this virus."

Malaria control efforts are currently facing substantial challenges, primarily due to increasing drug resistance,
including the first-line drugs artemisinins. From 2018 to 2021, there was a noticeable increase in new malaria
cases, with the count rising from 237 million to 254 million, and the annual death toll surged from 567,000 to
617,000 in 2021. Over 90% of these cases and 96% of these deaths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa, as
reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). Tragically, 80% of the mortalities were children under the
age of five. There is an urgent need for enhanced vector control measures and antimalarial drugs that are
prophylactic, therapeutic, and transmission blocking. The proteasome plays a crucial role in regulating various
cellular functions by degrading regulatory and damaged proteins. The proteasome is a well-established drug
target for cancer treatment, with three FDA-approved drugs, and for certain infectious diseases, with two in
clinical development. Malaria proteasome inhibitors have shown promise with killing activity against
Plasmodium parasites at multiple stages of their life cycle, including the challenging transmission and liver
stages. Therefore, a P. falciparum proteasome (Pf20S) inhibitor has potential to be a therapeutic, prophylactic,
and transmission-blocking agent. Moreover, Pf20S inhibitors demonstrate synergistic effects when combined
with artemisinins, making them even more appealing for malaria treatment. However, the development of orally
bioavailable Pf20S inhibitors that can minimize the emergence of resistance while maintaining high selectivity
for Pf20S over both the human constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome presents a challenge. We
have achieved significant progress in pursuit of these goals for antimalarial proteasome inhibitors.
Furthermore, we have solved multiple cryo-EM structures of Pf20S with a β5 inhibitor, a β2 inhibitor, and a
nonpeptide inhibitor, providing valuable insights into structure-activity relationships, mechanisms of resistance
and collateral sensitivity. This application seeks to build upon these achievements by advancing our
development program for both peptide-based and nonpeptide-based proteasome inhibitors, with a focus on
enhancing potency, selectivity, and in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties to achieve oral
bioavailability. We will conduct iterative structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies for both peptide- and
nonpeptide-based Pf20S inhibitor series and assess their antimalarial activities at different parasite stages in
vitro, as well as their parasitemia-reducing capabilities in animal models of malarial infection."

In this application we propose to develop the endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-
FNA) compatable optical diagnostic system that can determine the cellular composition of pancreatic
cysts in vivo and identify cystic lesions with early stage cancer features. Pancreatic cancer is the 3rd
leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, surpassing breast cancer. With a median
survival of 3 months, it has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers. The poor prognosis of
pancreatic cancer is due in large part to the inability to detect this cancer at an early stage, when the
option of a curative surgical resection is still possible. It is estimated that 8 million Americans have
pancreatic cystic lesions. Pancreatic cysts are the only readily identifiable precursors of pancreatic
cancer. Most commonly, these asymptomatic cysts are found incidentally when MRI/CT imaging is
performed for other purposes and then monitored with these imaging techniques for interval growth since
about 1 in 10 cysts have malignant potential. While CT and MRI could be used to screen for cystic
lesions, they have poor accuracy with regard to distinguishing cancerous and pre-cancerous cysts from
benign cysts. Currently, there is no accurate diagnostic technique that can distinguish cancerous and
pre-cancerous cysts from benign cysts, resulting in dire consequences, including the development of
cancer in cysts thought to be benign, or unnecessary pancreatic surgery for benign cysts, often with
significant morbidity and mortality. Thus, there is a critical need for a new diagnostic approach that
accurately identifies those pancreatic cysts that require surgical intervention and those that do not.
Recently we introduced a new diagnostic technology based on light scattering spectroscopy (LSS) that
identifies the malignant potential of pancreatic cystic lesions during routine diagnostic minimally invasive
EUS-FNA procedures. It employs a spatial gating contact probe that fits into a standard aspiration needle
and samples a fraction of the internal surface of the cyst forward hemisphere in approximately 2 minutes.
To improve accuracy and ensure clinical acceptance of the technique developing an articulating fiber
probe with an optical feedback capable of rapid automated data collection would be a significant
advance. Our preliminary results are very encouraging, indicating that the proposed technology could be
a tremendous aid in identifying both precursor lesions and early stage pancreatic cancers."

Child maltreatment is one of the most formidable public health crises in the United States,
affecting millions of youth each year. The adverse consequences of maltreatment for youth, as
well as for their families and entire communities, are pervasive, costly, and enduring. To
intervene and reduce these consequences, it is imperative that victims provide clear and
accurate accounts of their prior experiences. Currently, considerable skepticism exists regarding
maltreated youth’s ability to provide such accounts, especially for experiences that were
stressful, leading to youths’ reports being challenged or not believed. We contend that this
skepticism is unwarranted, and maltreated youth actually demonstrate better memory than their
non-maltreated counterparts, but only for stressful salient personal experiences. We will
ethically and rigorously test this possibility in the proposed study via a short-term longitudinal
experimental investigation that compares the effects of acute stress on memory between
maltreated and demographically matched non-maltreated 12-17-year-olds. In an initial in-person
session, youth will be randomly assigned (equal maltreated and non-maltreated youth across
age) to complete standardized salient personal activities that are experimentally manipulated to
vary in whether they induce higher or lower levels of acute stress. Immediately afterward, youth
will complete an encoding task comprised of positive, negative, and neutral images. In
subsequent sessions (two remote and one in person) spanning approximately one month,
youth’s memory will be tested for the images via a recognition task asking them to discriminate
previously seen from unseen images and for the personal activities via recall and direct
questions that probe for the extent and accuracy of memory. Youth’s rumination about the
personal activities will also be measured. Our main hypothesis is that maltreatment will lead to
particularly robust memory for the personal activities, but only when the youth complete these
under conditions of high stress. By contrast, because the emotional and neutral images are not
personally meaningful, we expect maltreatment to constrain youth’s memory performance for
the images. We also hypothesize that rumination will serve as an important mediator of the links
between stress and memory for the higher stress personal activities, most notably in the
maltreated youth. Overall, our results will provide much-needed knowledge about the precise
ways that maltreatment shapes different facets of youth’s memory, knowledge that will be
enormously valuable in improving trust in maltreated youth’s reporting of stressful experiences
and hence in directing interventions for victimized youth."
10993288,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Progression to metastatic disease from Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is a
significant cause of mortality. Central nervous system (CNS) metastases, which carry poor prognosis and limited
treatment options, can form intraparenchymally (IP) within the tissue of the brain or within the cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) filled spaces between the leptomeninges. The latter, termed leptomeningeal disease (LMD), is difficult to
diagnose and treat, and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying progression to LMD are poorly
understood. 60% of patients with LMD have past or concurrent IP metastases, but the mechanisms promoting
a switch to LMD invasion remain unknown. Interestingly, patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC are more likely to
progress to LMD, particularly at resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the standard of care for these
patients. While third-generation TKIs such as Osimertinib show excellent brain penetrance, resistant CNS
disease, including LMD, remains a pressing clinical problem. The primary aims of this project are to identify
mechanisms underlying progression to and persistence of LMD, and determine what factors favor this
progression in cases of TKI-resistant EGFR-mutant disease. I hypothesize that in a subset of IP cases,
progression to LMD occurs through invasion of parenchymal cells through the perivascular spaces in the brain,
and that this progression is promoted by mechanisms that synergistically foster TKI resistance. I have validated
multiple NSCLC murine models of comorbid IP and LMD following intra-arterial injection, including an EGFR-
mutant model that emerges at late-stage TKI resistance as well as a syngeneic model. In Aim 1, I will utilize
spatiotemporal barcoding of these lines to chart the anatomical routes cells traverse to reach the leptomeningeal
space. In particular, I will determine whether LMD metastases descend from parenchymal metastases, or enter
the CSF from systemic circulation across the blood-CSF-barrier. I will then assess how pathways downstream
of mechanosensing by β1-integrin, previously shown by our laboratory to promote CNS TKI resistance, may
modulate the ability of EGFR-mutant cells to complete this journey at resistance. Then, in Aim 2, I will investigate
the mechanistic role of the protein Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1), identified in our
biorepository samples as upregulated in the CSF of patients with LMD. TIMP-1 can signal through β1-Integrin
and CD63 to promote anchorage-independent survival, mirroring a phenotype observed in our LMD model lines
in vitro. Given the role of β1-integrin in this pathway, I will investigate whether stromal TIMP-1 levels play a dual
role in EGFR-mutant LMD by promoting cell survival while also promoting signaling underlying TKI resistance.
As a graduate student in Dr. Don Nguyen’s laboratory in the Pathology department at Yale University, I have the
support of a diverse array of translational and clinical researchers as my mentors and collaborators. Through
completion of the research proposed during the NRSA F31 fellowship, I will hone my experimental skills as I
progress towards my goal of becoming an independent researcher in the field of CNS metastases."
10994275,"Access to kidney transplantation as a cure for end-stage kidney disease is severely limited by donor organ
shortage. Exacerbating this shortage is the need for re-transplantation resulting from (1) early graft failure due
to poorly controlled alloimmunity; (2) late graft failure due to progressive organ fibrosis and occlusive
vasculopathy, two characteristics of chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Our preliminary studies from murine
models suggest that following organ anastomosis in kidney transplantation, the temporal process of initial
recipient monocyte infiltration followed by their ensuing differentiation to pro-inflammatory macrophages and
later macrophage maladaptive response to injuries plays a significant role in promoting alloimmunity and CAN.
Specifically, following the initial recipient monocyte infiltration, a monocyte cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase
called AXL determines the ability of the infiltrating monocytes to differentiate to pro-inflammatory macrophages
and promotes alloimmunity. Consequently, inhibiting AXL early post-transplantation significantly prolongs
rejection-free allograft survival. Later, in response to injuries such as ischemia, a macrophage intracellular
protein called Allograft Inflammatory Factor 1 (AIF-1) determines their maladaptive response to ischemia and
promotes kidney fibrosis. Consequently, inhibiting AIF-1 during kidney ischemia significantly reduces long-term
kidney fibrosis. These observations led us to hypothesize that in kidney transplantation, AXL determines early
macrophage differentiation and function, whereas AIF-1 determines late macrophage response to injury. Thus,
a potential therapeutic opportunity is to sequentially block AXL and AIF-1 in kidney transplant recipients to (1)
inhibit early alloimmunity and (2) prevent late kidney fibrosis. In this new R01 application, we propose two
specific aims that will: (1) determine mechanisms of AXL in early post-kidney transplant period on promoting
alloimmunity. This aim will also determine extracellular and intracellular AXL signaling partners, and test clinical
values of murine findings in human monocyte cell lines; (2) determine mechanisms of AIF-1 in late post-kidney
transplant period on promoting maladaptive response to injuries and allograft fibrosis. This aim will also
determine AIF-1 signaling components that control kidney resident macrophage functional outcome, and test
clinical values of murine findings in human cell lines. Our experienced team of investigators include the PI
Dr. Luo, an expert in transplant immunobiology who will direct all immunological studies in murine kidney
transplant models, and the co-I Dr. Privratsky, an expert in acute and chronic kidney injury models who will direct
all studies of post-kidney transplant injuries and measurement of long-term kidney allograft fibrosis and function.
Our ultimate goal is to identify new temporal and pathway-specific targets for modulating macrophage functions
post-kidney transplantation. These studies will pave the road for future designs of macrophage-targeting
therapeutics for enhancing kidney allograft survival, thus reducing re-transplantation need."
10994498,"Abstract
Recurring and debilitating seizures affect ~90% of individuals with Angelman syndrome (AS), a
neurodevelopmental disorder further characterized by intellectual disability, sleep disruption, and ataxia. These
seizures are often refractory to commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs, whose side effects can exacerbate
other AS symptoms. As a result, AS-associated seizures are consistently ranked as one of the most
challenging aspects of AS by caretakers and physicians. AS is caused by a loss of the maternally inherited
UBE3A allele because the paternally inherited UBE3A allele is epigenetically silenced in neurons, resulting in a
complete loss of UBE3A protein in all neurons. Previous preclinical therapeutic strategies and current clinical
trials have shown some promise by re-expressing UBE3A in neurons, but these efforts face several delivery
and toxicity challenges that may limit their clinical development. Therefore, it is necessary to identify other
novel treatment strategies to mitigate seizures in AS. UBE3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets substrates
for proteasomal degradation and consists of two main isoforms – short-UBE3A and long-UBE3A.
Dysregulation of UBE3A isoform substrates underlies AS symptoms. Indeed, each isoform may have distinct
cellular and phenotypic contributions to AS symptoms due to their unique N-termini, protein levels, and
subcellular localizations. However, how each UBE3A isoform and their respective substrates contributes to AS
epileptogenesis remains unclear. Such knowledge could suggest novel therapeutic avenues for treating
refractory AS-associated epileptogenesis. Accordingly, in the current proposal I will use two seizure models to
establish the contribution of each UBE3A isoform to AS seizure susceptibility (Aim 1), and I will use a proximity
ligation assay to define isoform-specific UBE3A substrates in a cell type that drives seizure susceptibility in AS
model mice (Aim 2). My work will thus identify the contribution of each UBE3A isoform and their respective
substrates to epilepsy in AS, enabling future pharmacological targeting that may overcome the limitations of
current therapeutic efforts."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a prominent neurodegenerative disease with over 90,000 cases being
diagnosed annually. Little is known about the pathogenesis of abnormal trunk posturing/impaired
postural control in PD. Trunk postural control is particularly problematic during both standing (e.g.
excessive forward and lateral flexion) and turning (“en bloc” turning). Corticospinal, reticulospinal and
vestibulospinal systems contribute to the control of trunk muscles, but their roles in the pathogenesis of
disordered trunk control are unclear. To date, no studies have investigated the function of descending
neural pathways on the control of the trunk during static postures and dynamic movements in people
with PD. This proposal will use two noninvasive neuromodulation techniques, transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) and electrical vestibular stimulation (EVS), to characterize: (i) the excitability of
corticomotoneuronal (corticospinal and corticoreticulospinal) projections to trunk muscles during quasi-static
postures and prior to turning, and (ii) the engagement of vestibulospinal projections during standing and
turning. Aim 1: (A) Compare trunk muscle corticomotoneuronal and intracortical excitability (via TMS)
in sitting and standing between people with PD and healthy controls. (B) Examine the relationships
between TMS responses and quantitative assessments of posture and gait. Trunk muscle responses
to single and paired-pulse TMS of the primary motor cortex trunk region will quantify the excitability of
corticomotoneuronal and intracortical (inhibition and facilitation) pathways in quasi-static postures (sitting
and standing). Aim 2: (A) Compare the modulation of corticomotoneuronal pathway excitability to
trunk muscles (via TMS) immediately prior to turns in people with PD and healthy controls. Single
pulse TMS will quantify the change in excitability of corticomotoneuronal pathways immediately prior to a
90° turn. Aim 3: Compare the modulation of (A) EVS-ground reaction force (GRF) coherence and (B)
EVS-trunk electromyograph (EMG) coherence prior to and during turns in people with PD and healthy
controls. Vestibulo-postural coupling will be tested by computing the coherence between EVS and the (A)
GRFs used to maintain balance and (B) surface EMG from the trunk muscles. This work will provide novel
insight into the pathophysiology of disordered trunk control in PD. This proposed study is part of a fellowship
training plan that will include training in (i) quantitative motor assessments using biomechanical and EMG
techniques, (ii) clinical neurophysiological and neuromodulation techniques, and (iii) professional
development skills that are essential for a successful career as a rehabilitation scientist. The University of
Minnesota’s expansive research infrastructure, the multi-disciplinary Program in Rehabilitation Science, and
the Movement Disorders Laboratory create an ideal environment for completing this research and training."
10996019,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Identification of neural and behavioral processes that drive eating disorder (ED) symptomatology is critical for
the development of more effective interventions for these serious and sometimes deadly disorders. One
candidate transdiagnostic mechanism underlying divergent but often overlapping symptoms in anorexia nervosa
(AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) is avoidance learning. The ability to learn how to avoid harm is critical for health
and survival, yet excessive avoidance learning leads to chronic maladaptive avoidance or compulsive behaviors.
Both AN and BN are characterized by elevated trait harm avoidance and maladaptive behaviors to avoid aversive
outcomes such as weight gain, ranging from extreme dietary restriction to repetitive cycles of binge eating and
purging (e.g., self-induced vomiting, excessive exercise). This raises the question of whether symptom
heterogeneity corresponds to differences in an individual’s strategy to avoid aversive outcomes that fall on a
continuum of anxious-avoidant vs compulsive behavior. Distinguishing between excessive active avoidance
learning (learning from successful actions that reduce harm) and passive avoidance learning (learning what
to avoid doing to prevent harm), which are thought to differentiate compulsive and anxious-avoidant behavior,
might critically inform etiological models of ED. This proposal tests the novel hypothesis that instrumental
avoidance learning is altered in ED, with corresponding differences in corticostriatal and limbic-prefrontal
prediction error BOLD response and functional connectivity, and that associations between active vs passive
avoidance learning and ED symptoms might differentiate bulimic-type from restricting behaviors, informing
compulsive vs anxious-avoidant mechanisms underlying symptom heterogeneity in ED. Participants (26 AN, 26
BN and 26 healthy controls (HC) ages 18-35) will complete a probabilistic card gambling task during fMRI that
assesses instrumental learning strategies to avoid heat pain. Computational modeling approaches will be used
to distinguish active from passive learning bias. Aim 1 will compare avoidance learning bias in AN, BN and HC
and will evaluate the association of active and passive avoidance learning with ED symptoms. Aim 2 will examine
whether corticostriatal and limbic-prefrontal function associated with avoidance learning differs in AN, BN and
ED, and in particular whether dorsal caudate response associated with active and passive avoidance learning
differs in AN and BN and relates to symptoms. Aim 3 will examine group differences in corticostriatal and limbic-
prefrontal PE-related functional connectivity associated with active and passive avoidance learning to better
characterize avoidance learning functional neural architecture in ED. Elucidating the relationship between
avoidance learning, ED symptoms and brain function to inform mechanistic understanding of the neurobiological
underpinnings of ED is both innovative and significant. Outcomes will be of clinical importance by providing
foundational knowledge to identify new behavioral and neural therapeutic targets. Data will provide
methodological groundwork for an R01 application examining avoidance learning across a broader ED spectrum."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a median survival of 3 years after diagnosis.
There are no cures for this disease. Although the etiology is still unclear, one of the major risk factors associated
with IPF is inhaled iron-rich particulate matter, such as asbestos and cigarette smoke. However, the specific role
of iron in the pathogenesis of IPF is an understudied area. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the
pathogenesis of IPF and thus to advance the development of effective therapies. The objective of the current
application is to understand the contribution of iron to the pathogenesis of IPF and the underlying mechanisms
with a focus on the iron-mediated activation of lung fibroblasts.
There is evidence showing that iron accumulates in the lung and contributes to lung fibrosis. However, the
molecular mechanisms for both processes are unclear. Our preliminary studies have identified the iron export
gene solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1) as a key gene for iron accumulation in lung fibroblasts. We
have also identified two novel iron-regulated genes, SH3 domain-containing ring finger 1 (SH3RF1), an E3
ubiquitin protein ligase, and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a cotranscriptional regulator and
provided evidence that both genes regulate lung fibroblast activation. Based on our preliminary studies, our
overall hypothesis is that an elevated level of iron in lung fibroblasts due to reduced SLC40A1 leads to the
activation of lung fibroblasts via the downregulation of SH3RF1 expression and the upregulation of HIPK2
expression. The hypothesis will be tested by a combination of in vitro studies using primary human lung
fibroblasts and in vivo strategies in two mouse lung fibrosis models using pharmacological and genetic
interventions. Aim I will determine the mechanisms by which iron accumulates in lung fibroblasts via SLC40A1
and the regulation and functional roles of SH3RF1 in iron-mediated lung fibroblast activation using loss- and
gain-of-function and mutagenesis approaches. Aim II will define the mechanisms by which iron activates lung
fibroblasts via HIPK2 using gene manipulation, coimmunoprecipitation, ubiquitination and molecular signaling
pathway analyses. Aim III will determine the in vivo effects of iron and HIPK2 on lung fibrosis in two preclinical
mouse models of bleomycin- and asbestos-induced lung fibrosis using fibroblast-specific genetic deletion of
Hipk2 and pharmacological inhibitors. The proposed studies will establish the molecular mechanisms of iron
accumulation in lung fibroblasts and novel roles for SH3RF1 and HIPK2 in lung fibroblast activation."
10982779,"Parents of children with cancer often face complicated decision making throughout their child’s illness.
Goals-of-care (GOC) interventions help patients, their families, and clinicians communicate and discuss
preferences for treatments together to ensure medical care is consistent with the family’s values, goals, and
informed preferences. To date, most GOC interventions have focused on adults and adolescents
resulting in a critical disparity of available tools for children dying of cancer. GOC conversations
between parents, who serve as primary decision makers for children, and clinicians often rely on verbal or
written information about possible medical interventions, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation or placement
on a respirator, during crises of clinical decline. However, this GOC process is often inadequate as it is
presently conducted, leaving families ill-prepared in times of distress.
 The majority of children with cancer and their families prefer to die at home, yet the majority of children with
cancer die in the hospital, and this disproportionately affects African American, Hispanic, and rural patients.
Novel interventions are needed to ensure GOC conversations happen earlier to ensure goal-concordant care.
To address these shortcomings, we have developed theory-based GOC video decision aids in English and
Spanish for parents of children with cancer. We have shown the efficacy of similar decision aids in adults using
Natural Language Processing (NLP), a form of computer-assisted abstraction, in pragmatic trials; but have not
examined the impact of these videos in children with cancer and their parents.
 The overall objective of this UG3/UH3 proposal entitled Video Inspired Discussions for Ethical
Outcomes in Pediatrics (VIDEO-PEDS) is to build the infrastructure for and conduct a large randomized
pragmatic trial of a GOC video decision aid in three diverse health care systems (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, and the University of Alabama). During the UG3 Phase (first two
years), we will refine the GOC video, finalize clinics and workflows, validate our NLP process, and pilot-test the
intervention. During the UH3 Phase (subsequent four years), we will conduct a large, pragmatic, randomized,
waitlist-controlled trial including 504 children with cancer aged 0-12 years. This trial will include 76 African
American, 76 Hispanic, and 76 rural children with cancer by design. Children will be randomized to Waitlist-
Control or the GOC Video Intervention in which the video will be shared with parents along with in-person and
telehealth sessions conducted by navigators to elucidate GOC preferences. After the intervention period, the
waitlist will open and all parents (i.e., Waitlist-Controls) will receive the intervention. Using NLP to detect
outcomes (e.g., GOC documentation), we hypothesize that intervention children, as compared to controls, will
have more GOC documentation (primary outcome). This proposal is significant, innovative, and feasible. The
intervention is a practical and innovative approach to help children with cancer and their parents."

Indigenous Communities of the Southwest
ABSTRACT
The prevalence and early initiation of nicotine vaping among Indigenous youth surpass that of all other
racial/ethnic groups. This concerning trend is prominent in urban environments, where approximately 60% of
Indigenous youth reside. In urban settings, multilevel influences heighten risks for nicotine and cannabis
vaping among Indigenous adolescents, including the intricate navigation of ethnic identity, which can
compound challenges these youth face. Preventing adolescent nicotine and cannabis vaping is further
complicated by the unique characteristics of vaping products. Their ease of concealability, the ability to
purchase online, and the lower perception of adverse health consequences contribute to their attractiveness.
Even among youth who successfully avoid traditional cigarette smoking, vaping nicotine remains a risk due to
misinformation, misconceptions, and misperceptions. Therefore, interventions that have demonstrated efficacy
in preventing the use of alcohol and other drugs may need to be adapted to specifically address the risks
associated with vaping. Tailoring interventions to these unique challenges is crucial to achieve the intended
impact and reduce the prevalence of vaping among Indigenous youth. However, no evidence-based
interventions exist for urban Indigenous youth. For over a decade, our team has collaborated with Phoenix
Indian Center to adapt and test substance use interventions for urban Indigenous youth. Now, Phoenix Indian
Center has prioritized nicotine and cannabis vaping as the most problematic substances in the local urban
Indigenous community. To address this community-driven priority with our long-term community partner, we
now propose to build upon our extensive experience to rigorously test the efficacy of the evidence-based
substance use prevention intervention, Living in 2 Worlds, adapted to include salient multilevel risk and
protective factors for vaping for urban Indigenous adolescents. We will also examine barriers and facilitators of
implementation to increase sustainability and the likelihood of real-world impact in eliminating racial and ethnic
disparities in substance use. To further ensure that the Living in 2 Worlds intervention is designed,
implemented, evaluated, and disseminated for cultural relevance and community specificity, we will engage an
Indigenous Youth Advisory Board throughout the research process. Our long-term goal is to build the evidence
to scale preventive vaping interventions across urban Indigenous communities in the U.S. As the next step
towards this goal, we propose the following: Aim 1: Identify multilevel risk and protective factors for nicotine
and cannabis vaping among urban Indigenous youth to adapt the Living in 2 Worlds intervention. Aim 2: Test
the efficacy of the adapted Living in 2 Worlds intervention for preventing initiation and reducing use of nicotine
and cannabis vaping, decreasing key risk factors for vaping initiation, and increasing skills that protect against
vaping. Aim 2b. Identify implementation barriers and facilitators of Living in 2 Worlds. Aim 3: Advance the
science for engaging youth throughout the research process."

10985094,"Project Summary / Abstract
Urinary tract infections (UTI) affect 13.3% of women and 2.3% of men annually with a high rate of recurrence.
Infection can be localized to the bladder (cystitis) or track to the kidneys (pyelonephritis), causing life-threatening
bacteremia. Increasing antibiotic resistance and indeterminate diagnostics underscore the need for more precise
and discriminant UTI diagnostic tools and individualized therapeutics. This proposal aims to perform human
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify risk variants associated with UTI. Preliminary data
demonstrated candidate genes within novel loci, such as PSCA, that localize their expression to the bladder and
kidney papilla, constituting new forms of immune defense. This candidate will be tested in bacterial binding
assays and in functional assays using UTI mouse models. Cell type-specific RNA labeling of the bladder
urothelium and single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of the kidney papilla will be performed to
understand the transcriptomic responses of specific cell types to UTIs in a Psca knockout mouse model. The
discoveries from this work will reveal novel roles for this candidate gene, as well as clarify mechanisms of the
bladder and kidney’s response to UTI. Furthermore, the insights from this research will help accurately identify
patients at risk for recurrent UTI or pyelonephritis, informing them to use prevention strategies when exposed to
a high burden of bacteria i.e, childbirth, sexual activity, invasive procedures. Along with an exceptional team of
leading experts in human genetics of kidney diseases, single cell transcriptomics, bladder malformations, and
urinary tract infections, this K01 award will support Dr. Katherine Xu in accomplishing the aims in her proposal,
as well as foster her professional development at Columbia University. She will complete additional training in
performing and interpreting large-scale human genomic datasets and snRNA-seq datasets, while also expanding
her knowledge in host-microbial interactions and in the molecular physiology of diverse cell types in the kidney

and grantsmanship necessary to support a career as an independent scientist. She hopes to eventually lead a
multidisciplinary team focused on redefining the genetic basis of human UTI susceptibility and mapping risk
variants onto specific cell types, which will help her develop an antimicrobial cell atlas of the kidney and bladder."
10985150,"Project Summary (30 lines max):
The goals of this proposal are to develop a novel nanotechnology based treatment for kidney stones and also
to support the career development of Ian Houlihan, PhD. in his research on developing nanotechnology based
treatments for urological diseases. Research: Kidney stones are a common disease with reported poor stone
free rates (as low as 40%) with current clinical methods of treatment which results in a high reoccurrence rate
(~40%) of the disease. Current clinical treatments for this disease are not without drawbacks, with the major
drawbacks being the use of radiation to visualize the stone, direct contact between laser fiber and the stone is
required, and damage to surrounding tissue due to the high absorption of laser energy in the water region.
With the new technology that is proposed here a number of these drawbacks can be addressed resulting in a
safer and more effective treatment for the patient and clinician. This project will first investigate how this new
technology causes stone comminution, this will be done by carrying out a baseline characterization of the
nanomaterials and human kidney stones being used. This will inform what the minimum energy is required to
cause stone breakdown and define the parameters needed for the in vivo application of this technology. It will
also investigate the two predominant modes of failure with using these nanomaterials, this mechanism is
believed to be a dual mode mechanism of photothermal and photoacoustic energy generated by the gold
nanomaterials when irradiated with a near-infrared laser source. Secondly this project will develop stone
targeting nanomaterials that will specifically bind to the kidney stone. These newly developed nanomaterials
will be characterized and their ability to convert laser energy to heat and acoustic forms will be quantified.
These targeting nanomaterials will be tested for safety in a number of different ways, firstly they will be tested
for any toxic effects on urothelial cells, secondly they will be tested with an ex vivo porcine model to ensure
they cause no adverse reactions to the kidney tissue, lastly these nanomaterials will be tested in a murine
model to show their safety in an in vivo model. The last aim of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study on the
efficacy of this technology in a porcine model. This new technology will be compared to the clinical gold
standard, laser lithotripsy. The model will also be used to assess how effectively and safely our technology
performs in a live animal. Career Development: The investigator has a technical background in engineering
and experience in developing materials for medical applications and aims to use this award to help in learning
new skills in developing and executing cellular and animal based studies for the development of new
treatments for urological disease. The career development plan has a number of different courses specifically
in learning about histopathology, biology of the kidney and statistical analysis for medical sciences. Training
includes workshops at the NIH funded kidney research center in Pittsburg University focused on pathology and
imaging of kidney disease states. A diverse mentoring team with complimentary skills has been put in place to
aid the investigator in their career goals."
10992699,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (“the Consortium”) brings together more
than 600 members with research interests in basic, clinical and public health sciences related to cancer. The
goal of the Consortium is the elimination of cancer as a cause of suffering and death through more effective
prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, deriving from fundamental insights into the biology of the disease. The
extensive interdisciplinary collaboration among the partner institutions in the cancer research disciplines of
basic, clinical, and public health sciences affords new opportunities to reduce suffering and mortality from
cancer.
The Consortium was established in 2002 to build upon the complementary strengths and resources of three
partner institutions: the Fred Hutch, which has been an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center since
1976; the University of Washington, which has significant strength in cancer research, clinical care, and
teaching; and Seattle Children’s, the major pediatric academic center in the region. In 2008, the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance, the cancer treatment center founded and equally co-owned by the three founding institutions,
was formally added to the cancer center designation.
The Consortium’s total funding base (direct dollars) is $242M, of which $117M is peer-reviewed, including
$50M from the NCI. During the last grant period, over 170 new faculty members joined the Consortium, adding
breadth and depth to our research and clinical capabilities. In the most recent year, we enrolled 1,338 patients
onto interventional treatment trials, of which more than 50% were investigator-initiated. The ratio of accruals to
newly registered patients was 28%.
The Consortium serves a catchment area of 13 counties in western Washington. This equates to the region in
which 83 percent of our patients reside. As the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in a five-
state region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), we not only seek to serve the health needs
of the catchment area through research, training, and outreach, but also to ensure high impact throughout the
larger region.
The Consortium continues to build upon historic strengths in basic cancer biology, immunology and
transplantation, pathogen associated malignancies, tumor specific translational research, computational
biology and studies of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes. The Consortium is well poised to continue its
exceptional level of research in these areas. The CCSG continues to have a high impact on the Consortium,
fostering new inter-institutional collaborations, strengthening the translational research platform, and
intensifying research efforts on problems of the catchment area. Partner institutions contributed nearly $1.2
billion in institutional support during the last project period, including investments in our laboratory and clinical
research infrastructure as well as in faculty recruitment and trainee support."
10992990,"ABSTRACT: Education-Outreach Core
The primary goals of the Education-Outreach Core are to promote a better understanding of issues concerning
reproductive health and infertility in low income, underserved communities and by middle school, high school,
and community college students. We propose to continue a two-pronged approach to education and outreach
that we developed in the past grant period. First, we will continue and expand our collaboration with Urban
Impact of Pittsburgh. A central part of Urban Impact’s mission is to provide youth with the education and skills
to transition successfully from middle school to high school and into adult life. We will provide engaging half-
day Saturday Academy style hands-on laboratory experiences to teach reproductive biology and genetics to
high school students from Urban Impact (Aim 1a). We offered the “Sea Urchin Fertilization” lab and will
continue to teach this lab moving forward. The students collected sperm and eggs from sea urchins, mixed
them together in a petri dish, and used microscopes to visualize sperm swimming, sperm incorporation, sperm-
egg fusion, pronuclear migration and the first cell divisions in the developing embryo. More recently, we offered
a lab using worms (c. elegans) as a model to study genetics and meiosis. We have partially developed 3 new
labs that will also be deployed for Aim 1a. As a result of participating in these highly successful lab
experiences, youth at Urban Impact requested that our P50 program participate in their job training program
(Jobs Inc.) so select students could gain further hands-on laboratory experiences while getting paid as part-
time employees, which we propose in Aim 1b of this renewal. We will also make the labs we develop and
refine available on a new website and at teacher workshops (Aim 1c). Second, we will continue and expand
our collaboration with The DataJam, a nonprofit organization that runs a nationally available academic
education program and competition to engage middle school, high school and community college students in
learning data analytical skills and appreciating how valuable data and critical thinking skills are for virtually all
career paths. DataJam teams formulate a research question, find publicly available data sets, analyze data
and present their findings to a panel of judges. Over the past grant period P50 graduate students have
developed DataSet Guides (that are freely available on the DataJam website) on “Male Reproduction &
Infertility”, “Sexually Transmitted Diseases”, “Contraceptives”, “Gender Inclusive Health Care”, “Screening
Newborns for Disease”. In this grant period we will develop new DataSet Guides on a variety of topics in
reproductive biology and genetics (Aim 2a), train P50 students and fellows to become DataJam mentors (Aim
2b), and train teachers to guide projects in these areas (Aim 2c)."
10992991,"Summary: Project I
Since the beginning of our National Center for Translational Research in Reproduction & Infertility in 2019, our
knowledge of genetic causes of infertility has expanded dramatically. In a recent (2022) study of whole-exome
sequencing (WES) from 1,000 cases of unexplained male infertility, we identified a plausible monogenic cause
in 20% of cases. Similar diagnostic yields have been reported for other male infertility cohorts. Despite these
impressive research advances, there are two major shortcomings of our work. First, we are not identifying all
genetic causes in our patients. Second, even though we understand the genetics much better than 5 years ago,
we have not made any impact on clinical diagnosis. In this proposal, our goal is to improve the diagnostic yield
of clinical genome sequencing for male infertility in two ways. First, we aim to improve diagnostic yield with new
approaches to sequencing and interpretation of genomes of male infertility. We will transition from WES to whole
genome sequencing (WGS), and in the process, expand our analysis methods to new types of variants
detectable by WGS. We will expand our analysis to new disease models for which we have been historically
underpowered to capture, such as autosomal dominant and digenic, and to interrogate genes involved in testis
development which have been previously overlooked. These new approaches will be applied to our existing
database of >1,600 WES data from patients, >80% of which are still unsolved, and to new patients that we
continue to enroll. Second, we aim to improve translation of our research findings by organizing an international
clinical genetics community to generate and share gene and variant interpretations. In the modern clinical
genetics landscape, most diagnostic workflows rely heavily on published guidelines for the interpretation of
genetic variants. Notably, there are no official expert panels reviewing genes or variants for infertility. We will
reactivate our existing international team, which has performed gene and variant interpretation in 2018 and 2020,
to fill this gap. We will build open our expertise and accelerate our curation by creating a shared online working
environment that records and reconciles interpretations. This review environment will also provide reference
information on testis gene expression, fertility phenotypes of mutations across multiple model organisms, and
an allele frequency database built from over 1,000 genomes of male infertility cases and 600 genomes from
normozoospermic controls. At the end of this 5-year project, we believe we will have achieved a milestone that
we targeted over 10 years ago. We will have built a strong foundation of solid research in male infertility genetics,
summarized and packaged this knowledge for clinical use. We aspire that, in 2029, genome sequencing will
finally become a routine clinical test for the diagnosis of male infertility."
10992992,"Project 2: Scalable in vitro gametogenesis for identifying genetic and epigenetic infertility factors.
This project seeks to advance the understanding of infertility by developing and deploying in vitro
gametogenesis platforms to identify underlying genetic and epigenetic causes. The field of reproductive
genetics has been severely hindered by challenges in distinguishing causative infertility alleles amongst
variants of unknown significance (VUS) identified by genome/exome sequencing. Our extensive use of mouse
modeling revealed that purely in silico pathogenicity prediction of infertility VUS have high false positive rates,
underscoring a need for scalable in vitro platforms for rapid screening of candidates. Speed and accuracy in
identification of causative variants is critical for clinical diagnostics and gene therapies – a goal of this overall
P50. Building upon a cytokine-free, transcription factor (TF)-based platform that we developed for simple and
scalable in vitro differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into primordial germ cell-like cells
(PGCLCs), this project proposes three interconnected aims to improve and deploy this system for accelerating
infertility genetics and epigenetics. First, missense VUS identified in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA)
patients by Project 1, which correspond to PGC-expressed genes, will be screened in our mouse PGCLC
differentiation system. Additionally, we will develop human iPSC lines with TFs that enable similar scalability to
enable functional testing of human-specific VUS. Secondly, we will test VUS predicted to impact post-PGC
stages of gametogenesis by CRISPR-assisted gene targeting in ESCs that will be differentiated by: 1)
conventional methods involving co-culture of testis somatic cells with PGCLCs; 2) by engineering our scalable
platform for autonomous and more efficient differentiation of PGCLCs into meiotic stages; and 3) making 100%
chimeric mice that can be phenotyped directly. Third, the project will validate the impact of disruptions in
epigenetic genes on both mouse and human PGCLC development, with a focus on 25 candidates identified in
our CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) screen of 701 epigenetic genes. Additionally, we will test whether two widely-
used histone deacetylase inhibitors (the anticonvulsant valproic acid and dietary supplement sodium butyrate),
both of which mimic the effect of depleting the top hit NCOR2 in the PGCLC differentiation system, disrupt
PGC development in mice. Overall, the integrated approach is designed to accelerate the validation of infertility
variants and mutations that are flagged as being potentially causative by clinical sequencing. This will aid in
training computational models (Project 1) and accelerate the identification actionable targets for gene therapy
approaches (Project 3)."
10994201,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes localized cardiomyocyte (CM) death which predisposes the adult mammalian
heart to persistent fibrosis and subsequent complications such as heart failure. Border zone (BZ) CMs are a
phenotypically distinct population of cells adjacent to the ischemic region, and their response may impact the
course of heart recovery. Adult BZ CMs become hypocontractile and may be susceptible to continued cell death,
which can lead to scar expansion and exacerbate pathologic remodeling. In contrast, neonatal BZ CMs may
activate programs promoting cell survival, dedifferentiation, and proliferation that can contribute to scarless heart
repair via cardiac regeneration. Therefore, it is imperative to study how BZ CMs respond under different
conditions, as this will improve our understanding of regenerative versus non-regenerative cardiac repair.
Neonatal mouse CMs retain some proliferative capacity through the first week of life, making the neonatal heart
an excellent model to study the differences between BZ CM phenotypes. Using RNA-Sequencing and spatial
transcriptomics, we identified that small proline-rich protein 1A (Sprr1a) is transiently upregulated following
cardiac insult and is predominantly expressed in BZ CMs. To investigate BZ CM function, we made a knock-
in/knockout mouse by replacing the Sprr1a locus with a GFP expression cassette (Sprr1aGFP). Importantly, we
verified that GFP recapitulates endogenous SPRR1A expression after cardiac insult. The aims of this proposal
are to determine the role of Sprr1a during cardiac injury and characterize the BZ CM response to cardiac insult
in regenerative versus non-regenerative cardiac repair. Aim 1 will investigate how Sprr1a deletion impacts
neonatal heart regeneration in response to cryoinjury and/or apical resection. Aim 2 will explore how SPRR1A
may regulate BZ CM survival via predicted interactions with cIAP1/2. Aim 3 will characterize the transcriptomic
profile of GFP+ BZ CMs isolated from hearts injured within the proliferative window (P1) versus post-mitotic
stage (P7) in control and SPRR1A KO hearts. These findings will characterize the phenotypic response of BZ
CMs in regenerative versus non-regenerative cardiac repair and define the role of Sprr1a in this process. The
discovery of additional markers within this sub-population will be beneficial for translational research as this may
facilitate the design of targeted therapies to enhance CM cell survival or proliferation post-MI."
10981504,"The collagen IVα345 (Col-IVα345) scaffold, the major constituent of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM),
is a critical component of the kidney glomerular filtration barrier. In chronic kidney disease, affecting hundreds
of millions of people worldwide, over two thousand genetic variants occur in the COL4A3, COL4A4, and
COL4A5 genes that encode the α3, α4, and α5 chains of the Col-IVα345 scaffold. The chains are the
autoantigens in Goodpasture’s (GP) autoimmune disease, mutated in Alport syndrome, and dysfunctional in
diabetic nephropathy (DN). The rationale development of therapy hinges on gaining new understandings of
pathogenic mechanisms. GP disease, a renal pulmonary disorder, continues to serve as the vanguard for
unlocking these medical mysteries. Among our discoveries are: a) the crystal structure of the NC1 hexamer
of the α345 collagen IV scaffold, b) discovery of the primordial chloride pressure and its constraint against
neoepitope formation in Goodpasture’s disease3, c) discovery of functionality of the α345 NC1 hexamer in
the assembly of the GBM as an ultrafilter of proteins, d) development of the collagen triple-helix mapping
tool, e) capacity of NC1 domain to home in the assembly of basement membranes, and f) detrimental effect
of high glucose on the BM modifying enzymes. These published discoveries, together with substantial
amount of unpublished pilot data, provide the framework for four specific aims. Our overarching hypothesis is:
Col-IVα345 tethers macromolecules forming supramolecular complexes, perturbation of which, in genetic and
acquired disorders, cause glomerulopathies. The achievement of the aims will yield new insights into the
etiology of GP, the structure and assembly of collagen IV scaffolds and binding partners, and the molecular
mechanisms of underlying DN. This knowledge is of fundamental importance for the rationale design of
therapies that target the primary cause disease."
10981317,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emerging data highlight previously unappreciated connections between cancer and scleroderma (SSc). Using
autoantibodies as probes to identify clinically and biologically relevant SSc subgroups, we have shown that
patients with anti-RNA polymerase III (POLR3), anti-RNPC3 or (monospecific) anti-Ro52 antibodies are more
likely to have a cancer emerge close to the time of scleroderma onset.1-6 In contrast, antibodies against
centromere, U1RNP, or Th/To proteins appear to define a subset of SSc patients with a lower cancer risk.3, 6, 7
Interestingly, patients with anti-POLR3 or anti-Ro52 who are positive for additional autoantibodies, including anti-
RPA194, anti-Th/To and anti-U1RNP, do not have increased cancer risk suggesting that increased breadth of
the immune response may be cancer protective.6-8 These data strongly suggest that SSc-specific
autoantibodies may be powerful tools for cancer risk stratification. It remains unknown whether (i) cancer
is a driver for the development of autoimmunity more broadly in SSc, (ii) diversified immune responses are
exerting potent anti-tumor pressure, (iii) autoantibody strength and breadth are predictive of incident cancer
diagnosis, and (iv) cancer emergence and elimination influences changes in SSc clinical outcomes and immune
responses. The proposed studies will use prospective and retrospectively collected data and
biospecimens from two well-characterized SSc cohorts to study the key relationships between
malignancy, the immune response and clinical expression of SSc. We will accomplish this through the
following specific aims: Aim 1 will test whether novel tumor markers, genetics, SSc autoantibody and clinical
features associate with incident cancer diagnoses in two large SSc cohorts. These data will provide a critical
foundation for the development of clinically actionable, targeted and evidence-based approaches for cancer
detection in patients with new onset SSc. Aim 2 will define whether cancer emergence or elimination influences
scleroderma clinical outcomes. We will address whether cancer remission associates with clinical improvement
in SSc and qualitative or quantitative changes in the autoantibody responses across this transition. In a
prospective study, we will test whether subclinical malignancy assessed by liquid biopsy shapes the immune
response and SSc disease process. Among those with a new clinical cancer diagnosis, we will assess whether
the mutational signature in the cancer matches that observed in circulating tumor DNA. These data, rigorously
generated in two of the largest SSc cohorts in the US, are likely to provide important insights with direct
relevance to management and therapy of SSc, while also illuminating the mechanisms operating at the
interface between cancer, anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity in SSc. This approach is also relevant
to other autoimmune rheumatic diseases in which cancer and rheumatic disease onset are temporally
linked."
10982175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genetic inheritance material of a eukaryotic organism (DNA) is stored in chromosomes. Understanding
of cellular activities in normal development and disease requires the analyses of critical regulatory roles that
are played by packaging the genome into a nucleoprotein complex termed chromatin. The structure of
chromatin and the regulatory machinery of its metabolism are uniquely important and thus, strongly
conserved in evolution.
 The objective of our work is to understand the relationship between the establishment of chromatin
structure in the male gametes (sperm cells) and regulation of their function. We will focus on a systematic
study of sperm chromatin structure and factors that mediate its assembly and remodeling during
spermiogenesis and egg fertilization in a model organism, fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). Sperm
chromatin differs in composition and architecture from the normal cell chromatin, in particular by an
extraordinary high degree of DNA condensation. It is rigid, enzymatically static and is formed by compaction
of the DNA with small cysteine-rich proteins termed protamines (and other sperm nuclear basic proteins,
SNBPs). Despite its importance for the life cycle of any sexually reproducing organism, sperm chromatin
structure has been poorly studied. To fill this gap, we will perform biochemical, biophysical and structural
analyses of in vitro reconstituted Drosophila sperm chromatin.
 Sperm chromatin replaces that of somatic cells and is assembled/remodeled in multiple steps during
sperm differentiation (spermiogenesis). At fertilization, the egg also faces the challenge of remodeling the
condensed sperm chromatin into an accessible, transcription- and replication-competent form. We recently
discovered cellular machinery that mediates sperm chromatin remodeling (SCR) in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
we will study the factors (protamine chaperones and enzymes of the thioredoxin system) that mediate SCR.
 Protamines in sperm undergo cysteine oxidation and oligomerization via intra- and inter-molecular
disulfide bonds. For fertilization success, the disulfides have to be reduced by egg-specific thioredoxins. Thus,
we will evaluate small-molecule inhibitors of the thioredoxin system as candidate agents to manipulate fly and
mouse fertility (putative contraceptive drugs).
 The successful completion of this project will lead to a comprehensive biochemical and biological
characterization of factors that mediate the assembly and remodeling of metazoan sperm chromatin. More
globally, our work will provide insights into the role of chromosome assembly and maintenance in regulation
of the cell function and will be applicable to understanding, diagnosis and treatment of human conditions that
involve defects in chromatin structure."
10982211,"Project Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among women (second
only to skin cancer)[11,12]
and up to 80% of survivors experience chemotherapy-induced neuropathy
(neuropathy)[14] which causes pain[15,16], falls[17–19], difficulty walking[18,20,21] and diminished quality of life
in survivorship [16,20]. To restore mobility and sensation, interventions that address motor control, patient-
reported symptoms, and motivation to participate - in combination - are most likely to succeed. Thus, we propose
to test the effect of partnered Adapted Argentine Tango (Tango) as an ideal physical activity intervention to
simultaneously target restoration of mobility and alleviation of symptoms through musically-entrained movement.
Tango is moderate intensity social dance, adapted for individuals with mobility deficits, that delivers sensorimotor
and cardiovascular training to rhythmic music. Tango promotes survivor participation through creative
engagement and caregiver inclusion. Previous research by the investigators established Tango as feasible for
aging survivors (up to 82 years) to engage in with high satisfaction and improvements to CIN-related
neurosensorimotor deficits. Therefore, we propose to conduct a multi-center, Phase II, randomized clinical trial
investigating Tango in 140 BC survivors with CIN. Our overarching hypothesis is that Tango is associated with
improved patient-reported sensation and clinically-measured dual task performance (primary) as well as
improved neuromotor control, falls incidence, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (secondary) relative to
standard of care (SOC) due to response of mediators including inflammation, neurotoxicity, and cognitive load
(exploratory) Our rationale: Tango combines the effects of rhythmic auditory stimulation on neuromotor
stability; physical activity practice on sensory, functional, and cardiovascular fitness; with social motivation to
participate in treatment. Our long-term goal is to optimize prevention and treatment of neuropathy utilizing non-
invasive, patient-centered treatment to improve sensory relief and function more definitively and more quickly for
more people. Toward this goal, BC survivors with CIN will be randomly assigned to Tango, twice per week, for
an 8-week period versus SOC for 4wks followed by one-way crossover to Tango for 8wks. Using an intent-to-
treat approach, this innovative pilot study will determine impact of Tango on sensory symptoms (primary AIM1),
dual task function (“walking and calculating”; primary AIM2); and explore treatment effects on biomarkers of
neurotoxicity and inflammation as well as cognitive load(AIM3). This project will expand our pilot work (R21-
AG068831) into a multicenter clinical trial designed to investigate the effect of social dance on sensory relief,
functional restoration, and key mechanisms of action among a diverse cohort of BC survivors suffering from
chronic CIN-related deficits."
10980611,"Intermediate progenitors are stem cell progeny that undergo limited proliferation to increase the generation of
differentiated cells per asymmetric stem cell division. Subsets of stem cells appear to have the capability to
further expand the generation of intermediate progenitors via transit-amplifying cell types while other subsets
do not. It is unclear whether the competency to amplify the generation of intermediate progenitors is encoded
in the lineage-specific gene regulatory program or is a general stem cell functionality that can undergo
controlled activation. In addition, stem cell functionalities must become decommissioned in intermediate
progenitors to ensure that they exclusively generate differentiated cell types. The mechanisms that
decommission stem cell-specific functions are not understood. This proposal uses fruit fly neural stem cell
(neuroblast; NB) lineages as a model to define the driver and the barrier to amplify ganglion mother cells
(functional analogs of intermediate progenitors in vertebrates) via intermediate neural progenitors (INPs). We
defined 4332 neurogenic enhancers that likely play important roles in specifying cell type-specific gene
expression in the developing brain. By using this collection of neurogenic enhancers, we identified 43
candidate transcription factors that regulate the competency to generate INPs. In parallel, we also identified 35
transcription factors that likely function to promote decommissioning of type II NB functionality genes genes in
INPs. By initially focusing on these genes, we will begin to define the mechanisms that (1) control NB
competency to generate INPs and (2) decommission NB functionality genes in INPs. Our proposed
experiments will provide insight into how dynamic control of neurogenic enhancers promotes (1) the
competency to expand intermediate progenitors via transit-amplifying cell types and (2) decommissioning of
stem cell-specific functions in intermediate progenitors."

interviewer-administered instrument (C-SSRS). ER and CR will be assessed with: 1)
electrocortical measures (Late Positive Potential) and self-reported affect during an emotion

Primary Aims:
 This is the first study to examine the predictive relationship of ER and CR with suicidal
ideation in middle-aged and older adults at high suicide risk. Understanding this relationship will
help identify: a) mechanisms which increase suicidal ideation, and b) subgroups of patients at
increased suicide risk. Consistent with the concept of “Precision Medicine”, the findings may
contribute to the development of personalized psychosocial interventions for this population."
10982014,"Summary
Cancer cells harbor signs of genomic instability, including genome rearrangements, which can contribute to
tumor development. Faithful DNA repair combats this instability and is a powerful tumor suppressor mechanism
whereas erroneous repair leads to pathological outcomes. The inherent genomic instability of cancer cells makes
them more vulnerable to a high damage burden and DNA damaging therapies are amongst the most widely used
and most successful cancer therapies. DNA repair is enabled within nuclear compartments or repair domains.
Spatial organization of repair facilitates biochemical reactions, restricts reactions to specialized compartments
while bringing DNA lesions in close proximity, thus favoring rare aberrant genome rearrangements. We have
made initial progress in revealing the mechanisms underlying the 3D re-organization of the genome following
DNA damage. Based on our seminal discovery of mechanical forces driving the 3D arrangement of the genome
following damage, we propose to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the assembly of DNA repair
domains and to evaluate the physio-pathological consequences of assembling these domains following
treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs. We will also explore the connection between DNA replication and DNA
repair in 3D. Our studies should reveal common rules governing the organization of DNA transactions in 3D,
which in turn have the potential to identify novel vulnerabilities for the most common modalities of cancer
treatment."

Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are debilitating progressive
neurodegenerative diseases. These diseases have no effective treatments currently and are among the greatest
unmet challenges in healthcare today affecting millions of people globally with enormous economic and societal
burdens. These disorders are characterized by neurodegeneration among other pathologies. A highly conserved,
yet less understood family of human genes, Tubulin Polymerization Promoting Proteins (TPPP), has long been
implicated in PD and ADRD such as Lewy Body Dementia. However, the pathogenic mechanisms involving
TPPP remain unknown. We recently developed a novel fly (Drosophila) model relevant to PD by utilizing a
mutation in the single Drosophila homolog of human TPPP, named Ringer. Ringer mutants recapitulate many of
the characteristics observed in human PD patients including severe locomotor disabilities, progressive
neurodegeneration (including dopaminergic neuron loss) and mitochondrial structural damage and dysfunction.
We have made novel observations that Ringer and human TPPP are both present in mitochondrial preparations
from Drosophila and postmortem human brain tissues, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitations from fly brain
mitochondrial preparations followed by mass spectrometry-based proteomics analyses revealed that Ringer
interacts with the electron transport chain (ETC) Complex I (CI) subunits and members of the SLC25A family of
mitochondrial carrier proteins, thus highlighting a novel and unique role of Ringer in mitochondria. Our
overarching hypothesis is that Ringer interacts with CI subunits and SLC25A solute carriers to stabilize the ETC
complexes and maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics that is crucial for neuronal survival. The overall objective of
this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms of Ringer function in mitochondria and extend our studies to
postmortem human brains to determine the functional conservation of TPPP and the relevance of human TPPP
to PD and related disorders. Using enzymatic assays, respirometry, LC-MS, biochemical, behavioral,
pharmacological, cell biological and genetic methodologies, our specific aims will: (1) Determine the
consequences of Ringer loss on mitochondrial bioenergetics, (2) Identify the molecular mechanisms by which
Ringer promotes ETC function and neuronal survival, and (3) Determine the cellular and sub-cellular localization
of human TPPP and any alterations in TPPP in PD brain tissues. Our proposed studies will for the first time
uncover a novel Ringer/TPPP function in maintaining mitochondrial health which is essential to prevent neuronal
cell death. We expect that our completed studies will provide unprecedented insights into potential pathogenic
mechanisms of human TPPP in PD and related disorders, and may contribute towards uncovering therapeutic
targets in the future."

 Gq family G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) on airway smooth
muscle (ASM) and T cell receptors (TCR) on T cells are critical in orchestrating cellular responses leading to
airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), remodeling and inflammation in asthma. Activation of these receptors
leads to the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) by the action of
phospholipase C. DAG, working in synergy with IP3-Ca2+ signaling and directly activating PKC and Ras guanyl
nucleotide-releasing protein, promote ASM contraction and proliferation. However, the independent role of
DAG in ASM functions remains less explored. DAG is phosphorylated and further converted into phosphatidic
acid (PA) by enzymes known as DAG kinases (DGK). Our studies in the last grant cycle demonstrated that
pharmacological and genetic inhibition of DGK inhibits ASM cell contraction and proliferation and attenuates
the development of allergen-induced airway inflammation, features of airway remodeling, and AHR in mice.
The functional effects of DGK inhibition are counter-intuitive as DGK inhibition is expected to enhance DAG-
mediated signaling and promote ASM contraction and proliferation. The functional dichotomy of DGK inhibition
suggests a complex relationship between phospholipid second messengers and the enzymes responsible for
their synthesis (PLC) and degradation (DGK). Indeed, the preliminary data presented in this application
suggest that low-level and transient elevation of DAG negatively regulates Gq-PLC activity. In this proposal, we
aim to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which DGK regulates ASM contraction and proliferation and T
cell-mediated immune response. Our central hypothesis posits that DGK isoforms serve as pivotal regulatory
checkpoints and fine-tune the spatiotemporal phospholipid signaling in ASM cells. Further, the inhibition of
DGK perturbs this delicate equilibrium and attenuates the asthmatic airway response by affecting the
stoichiometry of lipid second messengers responsible for ASM functions. To achieve our goals, we will employ
diverse, state-of-the-art tools such as targeted phosphoproteomics, lipidomics, fluorescence sensors and
genetic/pharmacological inhibition of DGK. In Aim 1 studies, we will discern how DGK inhibition impacts
phospholipid signaling and the activation of effectors involved in ASM contraction. In Aim 2, our studies will
focus on establishing how DGK isoforms regulate DAG kinetics and signaling, which in turn regulate ASM cell
proliferation. Finally, to establish the therapeutic relevance of our findings, Aim 3 studies will test the efficacy of
a newly developed DGK isoform-specific small molecule inhibitor (ASP1570) in mitigating features of allergic
asthma in a murine model. We will also discern the mechanism by which DGK inhibition modulates T cell-
mediated immune response. Collectively, our studies will provide a deeper understanding of the intricate
regulation of phospholipid signaling and functions in ASM and T cells. Furthermore, they will demonstrate the
efficacy of inhibiting the  isoform of DGK in mitigating multiple features of asthma."
10981942,"The delivery of therapeutic nucleotides to the myocardium is notoriously challenging and remains an important
unmet clinical need. Based on the global success of mRNA vaccines, solid lipid nanoparticles are the most
widely used vehicle for RNA delivery. We recently identified species of lipid nanoparticles with unprecedented
cardiotropism (cLNPs) that are efficient at delivering inhibitory RNA cargos to the heart. This supports
development of cLNPs for the therapeutic inhibition of select cardiomyocyte targets. Our prior work suggests
that increases in stable, post-translationally detyrosinated microtubules, as mediated by vasohibins
(VASH1/2) in complex with their chaperone (SVBP), contribute to contractile dysfunction in human heart
failure and clinically relevant animal models. Accordingly, the proposed research tests the hypothesis that
cLNPs with inhibitory cargos that limit disease-associated microtubule network detyrosination can improve
contractile dysfunction in disease models where increased VASH1 or VASH2 expression has been linked to
systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 experiments will prioritize therapeutic
reagents by characterizing the extent and duration of on- and off-target effects of cLNPs with alternative
inhibitory cargos (siRNA, shRNA, and antisense oligonucleotides) against both constitutively expressed
transcripts or against Vash1, Vash2, or Svbp in healthy rats. Studies demonstrating functional inhibition will
be extended to human myocardium using ex vivo delivery of cLNPs to perfused cardiac wedge preparations
derived from heart transplant recipients. Aim 2 experiments will determine whether short-term inhibition of
Vash2 via delivery of cLNPs is sufficient to blunt contractile dysfunction in viable myocardium following acute
myocardial infarction. Aim 3 experiments test whether cLNPs achieving sustained delivery of Vash1 can delay
the progression of diastolic dysfunction in an animal model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
Our overall study design uses novel and complementary experimental approaches that seek to rigorously
characterize inhibitory nucleic acid delivery via cLNPs, and then test them in clinically relevant models of
microtubule-dependent cardiac dysfunction. Use of both acute and chronic models of cardiac dysfunction,
and in turn acute and chronic therapeutic inhibition, respectively, exploits a range of therapeutic options of
cLNPs. Inclusion of delivery to human myocardium furthers ultimate clinical translation. Together this work
will establish whether inhibition of microtubule network remodeling is therapeutically beneficial in heart failure,
defne which molecular target is best suited for each of two therapeutic scenarios, and establish the versatility
of cLNP mediated delivery of inhibitory nucleic acids for the treatment of cardiac dysfunction."
10981983,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and is responsible for 20% of deaths in
the United States alone. Among both disabling and fatal events, cardiac arrhythmias play a central role. In this context,
electrophysiological studies of cardiac models of arrhythmias in vitro are essential to provide a fundamental understanding
of the underlying mechanisms and develop novel therapeutics. In particular, monitoring cardiomyocyte action potential
propagation at the cell network level with subcellular resolution and over extended periods is of fundamental importance to
comprehend the role of gap junction distribution and sodium channel clustering, at the microscopic scale, in the activation
wavefront propagation in cardiac tissue. Alas, current electrophysiological techniques suffer from severe technical
limitations which prevent performing such experiments and, therefore, hinder progress in cardiovascular research.
In this proposal, we introduce the concept of multi-electroplasmonic nanoantenna arrays (MENAs) to enable wireless
transmembrane-level electrophysiology in networks of cells with subcellular resolution and over extended periods. MENAs
are composed of protruding nanomushroom-like electroplasmonic nanoantennas designed to strengthen coupling at the cell-
nanoantenna interface and provide large seal resistances with the cells cultured atop. Under such conditions, local
electroporation provides direct intracellular access to the structures and permits each nanoantenna to scatter light with an
intensity proportional to the cell transmembrane potential. Compared to the patch clamp technique, MENAs are not limited
to a single cell at a time but permit the study of cellular networks with up to a million recording sites simultaneously. Due
to their wireless nature, MENAs do not need conductive traces or integrated amplifiers, which limit the lateral resolution of
traditional multielectrode arrays to ~20 µm and, consequently, can achieve sub-micrometer resolution. Furthermore,
MENAs do not suffer from photobleaching and permit long-term stability much greater than fluorescence-based reporters,
such as voltage-sensitive dyes (up to several days versus a few minutes, respectively). Compared to recent electro-optic
approaches limited to single-site extracellular recordings, MENAs provide intracellular access and permit multi-site
transmembrane-level electrophysiology. The following three aims will be achieved to demonstrate the concept of MENAs:
Aim 1 – Nanofabrication and electro-optic characterization of MENAs: A scalable nanofabrication process will be
developed to manufacture MENAs. Electro-optic performances of the resulting nanotransducers will be characterized.
Aim 2 – Characterization of MENA electrophysiological recording properties with cardiomyocyte monolayers:
MENAs recordings will be studied in terms of amplitude, duration, and yield and validated with patch clamp experiments.
Aim 3 – Proof-of-concept study of the activation wavefront propagation in spatially organized cardiomyocyte
cultures modeling cardiac arrhythmia: MENA electrophysiological capabilities will be illustrated on arrhythmia models.
The proposed technology is a breakthrough innovation that will prospectively revolutionize the understanding of
cardiovascular systems by enabling fundamental and pharmacological studies at an unprecedented level. In the long term,
MENAs will contribute to relieving the growing social and economic burden of cardiovascular diseases on society"
10982293,"Project Summary
One of the most robust findings in dementia research is that high educational attainment lowers the risk of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD); a condition expected to affect more than 150 million people
by 2050. Yet, because of large variability in the content and quality of K-12 and college education by place, race,
and socioeconomic status, educational experiences may better explain differences in late-life cognitive health.
Evidence, however, is scarce on the causal effects of specific educational experiences on late-life cognition, and
when they matter most. This is largely due to limited high-quality data spanning sufficient time to describe the
educational experiences of adults old enough to exhibit cognitive decline, and unobserved confounders in school
experiences. The proposed study will overcome the limitations of prior studies and expand the literature by
constructing a new dataset, linking it to multiple surveys, and using rigorous causal inference methods.
Specifically, we will leverage a natural experiment that provided variation in K-12 and college educational
experiences in the 1950s-60s to evaluate the causal effects of educational content and quality on the cognitive
function of older adults today. The natural experiment is The National Defense Education Act (NDEA), a federal
program implemented between 1958 and 1964 focused on improving students' mathematical and scientific skills.
NDEA provided states with substantial resources 1) to improve science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) and foreign-language education in K-12 and 2) provided college loans for low-income
students majoring in these fields. Funding levels varied over time by states, birth cohorts, and subjects based on
poverty levels and population size. This enables us to use a two stage difference-in-differences framework to
study causal effects of educational experiences on cognitive health for birth cohorts who were differently exposed
to NDEA and are now sufficiently old to exhibit symptoms of cognitive decline. Using historical education data,
and several longitudinal surveys on health, education, and economic outcomes, we will: 1) document the NDEA's
funding allotments and its effect on K-12 and/or college experiences, 2) estimate the causal effects of educational
experiences during K-12 or/and college on cognitive aging, 3) identify causal pathways mediating the total effect
of educational experiences on cognitive health, and 4) examine whether long-term effects from Aims 2 and 3
vary by sex, race, geography, childhood socio-economic status, and genetic pre-disposition for ADRD and its risk
factors. This study will have a high impact because it creates new data on educational experiences linkable to
existing, but rarely combined, surveys to address one of today's costliest health concerns, ADRD. These
approaches and findings will help provide the first causal evidence of how educational experiences impact
cognitive function, with a particular focus on quantitative coursework, where racial and SES gaps mirror those
for ADRD."
10982346,"This renewal proposal builds on the scientific premise that even though right ventricle (RV) function and female
sex are major determinants of survival in pulmonary hypertension (PH), no RV-specific or sex steroid-directed
therapies exist. While it is known that macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome activation leads to RV failure, we now
demonstrate for the first time that the NLRP3 inflammasome is also active in RVCMs to promote contractile
dysfunction. The goal of this proposal is to identify novel and therapeutically targetable mechanisms by which
the female sex steroid 17b-estradiol (E2), via its receptor ERα, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in
RVCMs to enhance contractile function and improve RV-pulmonary artery (PA) coupling. We put forward the
novel hypothesis that RVCM NLRP3 inflammasome activation is sexually dimorphic, and that ERα improves RV-
PA coupling in PH by inhibiting RVCM NLRP3 activation and preventing inflammasome-mediated RVCM
contractile dysfunction. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify sexual dimorphisms in RVCM
NLRP3 inflammasome activation and downstream signaling as mediators of sex differences in RV adaptation
and RV-PA coupling; 2) To establish that E2 inhibits RVCM NLRP3 inflammasome activation via ERα; and 3)
To establish NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to improve RV-PA coupling in RV failure
in low endogenous estrogen states. We will employ rat models for comprehensive in vivo and ex vivo studies,
complement these studies with mechanistic experiments in isolated primary rats RVCMs as well as in human
chambered muscle pumps generated with inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs)
exposed to pressure overload, and validate our findings in RV tissue from PH patients. Endpoints investigated
will include RV function and structure, exercise capacity, NLRP3 signaling, contractile signaling, as well as
ATAC-seq followed by transcription factor enrichment analysis (TFEA). Contractile function will be assessed by
pressure volume loops and echocardiography, an isolated perfused heart model, and by measuring contractility
in iPSC-CMs and RVCMs. The proposed studies are significant, because they will 1) identify NLRP3 signaling
as a sexually dimorphic modulator of RV function that is mediating RV resilience in pre-menopausal females, 2)
establish a novel and therapeutically targetable ERα-NLRP3-calcium signaling axis in the RV, and 3) establish
optimal strategies and conditions to inhibit NLRP3 in the RV-PA unit. Conceptual innovation is provided by
identification of RVCM NLRP3 inflammasome activation as a novel, sexually dimorphic, and ERα-regulated
modifier of RV adaptation in PH. Technical innovation is provided by use of 1) human chambered muscle pumps
generated with iPSC-CMs, 2) ATAC-seq with TFEA in RVCMs, 3) novel and highly selective NLRP3 inhibitors,
and 4) a large animal model of RVF. Upon completion of the proposed studies, we will have established sexual
dimorphisms in RV NLRP3 inflammasome activation as a mediator of sex differences in RV adaptation in PH,
and identified NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition as a novel mechanism of ERα-mediated RV protection in PH."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a vaccine that confers robust and durable protection against
transplacental transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV). Accomplishing this goal may be challenging in that the vaccine
may need to induce both antibody and T cell responses to confer highly effective protection against ZIKV at the
maternal-fetal interface (MFI). Studies with pregnant women in Brazil have suggested that antibody responses
may contribute to pathogenesis of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and neutralizing antibody responses may
not correlate with protection against CZS. Recent human studies also suggest that the anti-ZIKV antibody
response may be less durable than T cell response. However, ongoing ZIKV vaccine development efforts are
focused on eliciting mainly antibody responses. Based on our published data demonstrating a critical role for
CD8 T cells in protecting against ZIKV infection in multiple mouse models, we will test our central hypothesis
that a robust ZIKV vaccine-induced CD8 T cell response in mothers is required to provide strong and durable
protection against transplacental transmission of ZIKV. Our replicon RNA vaccine expressing ZIKV
premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) or nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) induces robust protection against ZIKV
infection in pregnant mice but only partial protection in their fetuses. Therefore, we will use these replicon RNA
vaccines and mouse models to achieve the following Specific Aims: 1) Improve vaccine-induced protection
against ZIKV infection during pregnancy, and identify the maternal immune responses associated with the most
protective and durable vaccines. 2) Test the role of CD8 T cells in vaccine-induced protection, and determine
precise features of MFI CD8 T cells elicited by the most protective and durable vaccine. We have expertise in
examining flaviviral pathogenesis and immunity using mouse models. We also have a longstanding collaboration
with colleagues at our institute and UC San Diego to investigate virus-host interactions using genomics and
histopathology-informed approaches."

Alcohol has been consumed by humans for more than 4000 years. Luckily, approximately 85%-90% of individuals who consume alcohol socially never develop alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms. Using rodents as a model system, we were the first to identify the existence of endogenous signaling pathways that protect against the development of AUD-associated phenotypes and termed these the STOP pathways (Reviews, [1-3]). Among the STOP genes is Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neurotrophic factor that through the activation of its receptor TrkB, plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory [4]. For example, we found that BDNF signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) gates the transition from moderate to excessive alcohol use [5-11], and that malfunctioning of BDNF signaling in the DLS and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) drives the escalation of alcohol use [12-14]. We also found that mice carrying a common polymorphism (Val68/MetBDNF), which inhibits the normal function of BDNF [15, 16], consume alcohol compulsively [17]. Recently, we found that the anxiolytic actions of alcohol are attenuated in mice carrying the Met68BDNF allele [18](Fig.1). We further found that Met68BDNF mice exhibit increased social anxiety [18](Fig.2-3), and increased alcohol preference vs. social interaction (Fig.4). Importantly, we found that these behavioral phenotypes are rescued by overexpression of wildtype BDNF in the ventral hippocampus (vHP) of Met68BDNF mice [18](Figs.5-6). We also found that acutely alcohol increases BDNF expression (Fig.7) and activates TrkB signaling in the vHP (Fig.8), whereas chronically alcohol inhibits BDNF/TrkB signaling in the vHP (Figs.9-10). This proposal is aimed at testing the hypothesis that BDNF in the vHP and/or vHP circuitries in female and/or male mice contributes to the acute anxiolytic and social actions of alcohol, and that malfunction of BDNF in the vHP and/or in vHP projecting neurons promotes alcohol-induced anxiogenesis, social anxiety and alcohol preference over social interaction.
Aim 1 Determine whether BDNF in the vHP and in vHP neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdala and/or lateral septum promotes anxiolysis and whether disruption of BDNF signaling in the vHP and vHP projecting neurons promotes anxiogenesis in males and female mice. We found that acute alcohol administration is less anxiolytic in mice carrying the Met68BDNF allele [18] (Fig.1), a phenotype which was rescued by overexpression of wildtype BDNF in the vHP of male Met68BDNF mice [18](Fig.5). The vHP plays a role in anxiety [20-22] and anxiolysis [23] in part via its projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and lateral septum (LS), respectively. Using viral tools in combination with behavioral paradigms, we will examine the hypothesis that BDNF in vHP neurons and/or in VHP neurons that project to the BLA and/or LS contributes to alcohol-induced anxiolysis, and that when BDNF signaling in the vHP and/or vHP projecting neurons is disrupted, alcohol promotes anxiogenesis (Model 1). 
Aim 2 will examine whether alcohol promotes social behaviors via BDNF in the vHP and/or in vHP neurons projecting to the medial prefrontal cortex and/or lateral septum. We will also determine whether dysregulation of BDNF signaling in the vHP promotes social anxiety and alcohol preference over social interaction in male and female mice. The vHP is associated with social behavior [24-26]. We, and others, found that mice and humans carrying the Met66 (Human) Met68 (mice) allele exhibit social anxiety [18, 27] in male mice (Figs.2-3). We also discovered that male Met68BDNF mice prefer alcohol over social interaction [18](Fig.4), a phenotype that was rescued by overexpression of wildtype Val68BDNF in the vHP of Met68BDNF mice [18](Fig.6). The vHP projects to the mPFC and LS, and both regions play a role in social behaviors [25, 26, 28]. Using viral approaches with behavioral paradigms, we will examine the hypothesis that BDNF in the vHP and/or in vHP projecting to the mPFC and/or LS contributes to social behavior and that malfunctioning of BDNF signaling in the vHP and/or vHP projecting neurons causes social anxiety and increases alcohol preference vs. social interaction in female and/or male mice (Model 1). 
Except for our recent findings [18], nothing is known about the interaction between alcohol and BDNF in the vHP. The experiments described herein will shed the light on the contribution of the vHP circuitry in general and BDNF in the vHP in specific to alcohol-dependent phenotypes in male and female mice.

10982851,"Candidate’s Long-Term Career Goals: To become an independent clinical investigator that strengthens ICU
antimicrobial stewardship and personalizes antibiotic use in nosocomial pneumonia.
Clinical Problems to be Addressed with this project: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is common,
costly, and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The present standard of care in
VAP is treat all cases with 7 days of antibiotics, regardless of patient or pathogen. This inflexible approach
generates both antibiotic overtreatment and undertreatment of the diverse group of patients affected by VAP.
Specific Aims: A lack of reliable biomarkers to ascertain cure of infection and use of antiquated dichotomous
trial outcomes that do not reflect bedside clinical priorities have impeded our ability to personalize VAP
antibiotic treatment durations (ATDs). Dr. Albin aims to 1) identify unique VAP-specific alveolar biomarkers to
guide ATDs, and 2) validate pragmatic, hierarchical analytic methodologies for future VAP ATD trials.
Candidate’s Background: Dr. Albin is Assistant Professor in Infectious Diseases at the University of Michigan
(UM). He has 20 publications, including 12 original research manuscripts and 11 first-author peer-reviewed
publications. Dr. Albin has core training in introductory biostatistics and epidemiology and is a graduate of the
UM Clinical Trials Academy. His work has been supported by a Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health
Research CATALYST award and internal funding from the UM Department of Internal Medicine.
Career Development Plan: To meet his goals, Dr. Albin seeks advanced methodologic training in applied data
science, clinical epidemiology, trial design/analysis and revealed preference survey methods, as well as
experiential training in alveolar biospecimen collection/ICU trial performance. His 5-year plan includes didactic
courses that build on his core training, project-based mentoring by experts, career advancement activities, and
specific milestones to ensure a successful transition to independence. Dr. Albin’s primary mentor is Keith
Kaye, MD, MPH. His co-mentors are Robert Dickson, MD; Krishna Rao, MD, MS; and Richard Wunderink, MD.
Deliverables: This project will identify clinically translatable VAP-specific alveolar biomarkers and pragmatic,
hierarchical VAP trial analytic methodologies. Coupled with the didactic and experiential training encompassed
in the career development plan, this award will competitively position Dr. Albin for R-series work aimed at
strengthening ICU antimicrobial stewardship and personalizing antibiotic use in pneumonia."

Substance use and associated HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), and mental health comorbidities continue to drive
morbidity and mortality. Interdisciplinary, interinstitutional collaborations can challenge paradigms to achieve
advances in substance use treatment that limit the spread of HIV/HCV and decrease morbidity and death.
Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) are national
leaders in substance use research and are located in states with high rates of substance use and new HIV
infections. For these reasons, this application seeks to establish the Vanderbilt Oregon COllaborative
Scholar Training in Addiction Research (COSTAR) K12 program to train and mentor the next generation of
substance use researchers. We propose to support a minimum of three faculty Scholars who have completed
an MD or PhD in the health sciences at a level of 75% effort for up to five years. VUMC and OHSU have a rich
research environment and highly successful history of developing the careers of research scientists
. Additional
strengths of VUMC/OHSU include
four addiction fellowship programs, the Tennessee Center for AIDS
Research, the Vanderbilt Center for Tobacco Addiction and Lifestyle at VUMC and the Western States Node of
the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network, the Portland Alcohol Research Center, and the
Rural Opioids Initiative at OHSU. In this application, Drs. Tindle (nicotine dependence), Freiberg (unhealthy
alcohol use), and Korthuis (drug use) will partner with interdisciplinary faculty mentors from both VUMC and
OHSU to develop and implement COSTAR. The COSTAR training curriculum includes (1) mentored
research projects, (2) didactic education, (3) completion of a structured institutional career development
program, and (4) optional multisite research training. COSTAR objectives and Specific Aims: 1. To create a
sustainable K12 program that fosters interdisciplinary, intensive mentored research training and career
development for early career MD, PhD, MD/PhD investigators that focuses on substance use/disorders with an
emphasis on vulnerable populations (e.g., people with HIV); 2. To produce a diverse group of well-trained
Scholars with the expertise to study: the risk factors for, and mechanisms underlying, substance use/disorders,
and the behavioral and health disparity aspects of substance use/disorders and its associated morbidity; 3. To
provide Scholars with a research environment that offers mentors and topic experts with expertise in key
research domains and protected time to innovate and build an individualized research program; 4. To leverage
VUMC and OHSU existing infrastructure and location to provide Scholars with hands-on instruction in a
mentor’s laboratory, didactic education, access to existing cohort/trial data and statistical support and facilitate
participation in a mentored research project that leads to an R01 or external career development award
submission; and 5. To build the administrative structure that creates program cohesion, guides selection of

10993782,"ABSTRACT. Patients with juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (JoRRP) suffer from recurring
epithelial papillomas along the respiratory tract caused by low-risk H PV viruses, predominantly H PV6. This most
common benign neoplasm in children varies significantly in clinical course. Patients undergo an average of 4-5
surgeries in the first year post-diagnosis, and severe cases can result in hundreds of surgeries and progression
to cancer. The lack of effective medications significantly lowers the quality of life for children with RRP, and
highlights the need for new biomarkers and therapies. To develop therapeutics and prognostic markers requires
overcoming a deep gap in knowledge of viral and host cell factors that produce papillomas (ie, candidate targets
and markers). This is now possible thanks to the development of models of normal and JoRRP 3D stratified
squamous epithelium (SE). Using fresh tumor and matched nondiseased (ND) tissue from children with JoRRP,
we generated primary monolayer keratinocytes, which we then engineered into organotypic epithelial rafts. With
this established pipeline of internally controlled 2D/3D models, we have made significant strides.
Our global transcriptome analyses of 2D JoRRP/ND keratinocytes defined a JoRRP-specific EMT-like
disease signature, which we validated in rafts and patient specimens. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
of HPV6+ RRP specimens (vs matched HPV- ND controls) further uncovered 16 transcriptionally distinct
keratinocyte subpopulations (clusters C0-15). CS bears striking similarity to our recently published cancerassociated
""HI ODEN"" subpopulation induced by high-risk HPV16. Both are located in superficial layers where
H PV amplification occurs, and both share biomarkers including the ELF3 transcription factor, which is required
for HIDDEN formation.
Our new data show that the HPV16 E6/E7 oncogenes are sufficient to induce HI ODEN, suggesting that
conserved HPV6 E6/E7 activities might induce analogous subpopulations at the epithelial surface. In Aim1, we
test whether and how HPV6 E6 and/or E? induce CS, and whether CS is required for viral progeny production.
Our scRNAseq data also revealed striking abundance of HPV6 E5γ and δ transcripts across clusters, indicating
importance for viral processes and/or keratinocyte phenotypes. While functions of low-risk HPV E5γ/δ proteins
are unstudied in translational disease models, HPV6 E5γ was reported to bind the EGFR and ERBB2 receptor
tyrosine kinases. In Aim2, we test whether HPV6 E5γ and/or E5δ sustain JoRRP phenotypes, and whether they
do so, at least in part, via EGFR/ERBB2 signaling."

More than half of Kenyan children under 5 years (~4 million Kenyan children) will not reach their developmental
potential, a pathway partly determined by modifiable maternal risk factors such as stress, infection, and
inadequate nutrition in pregnancy and lactation. Maternal factors such as older age, anemia, poor nutrition, HIV
infection and depression have been associated with adverse effects on child neurodevelopment, although the
quality and strength of the evidence varies. Data on the relationship between maternal factors and human milk
oligosaccharides (HMOs), one of the most abundant bioactive molecules in human milk, are all from high-income
settings, where the composition of HMOs differs by maternal age, nutritional status, depression, and HIV
infection. Limited data exists on the influence of HMOs on child neurodevelopment, including in Sub-Saharan
Africa. HMOs and maternal factors may act independenly to influence child neurodevelopment. It is plausible
that the maternal factors may impact HMO profiles, and, in turn, influence child neurodevelopment. The
proposed F32 research project leverages data from an ongoing cohort ongoing cohort of Kenyan mother-infant
pairs (N=350) (Tunza Mwana R01HD096999; 1P01HD107669-01) followed up for 2 years from birth to evaluate
the association between maternal HIV infection, milk composition, and the infant gut microbiome, and
characterize infant growth and neurodevelopment at 24 months of age. In Aim 1, we will determine how adverse
maternal factors in pregnancy (older age, depressive symptoms, anemia, HIV infection, and nutritional status)
affect HMO composition at 6 weeks postpartum. In Aim 2, we will determine the association between adverse
maternal factors in pregnancy and child neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age. Finally, in Aim 3, we
will assess if HMOs mediate the relationship between adverse maternal factors in pregnancy and child
neurodevelopment at 2 years of age. This project will provide new insights on modifiable maternal factors and
child neurodevelopment in Sub-Saharan Africa region, and inform ways to prevent or reverse the
neurodevelopmental consequences of adverse maternal environment by highlighting the potential mechanisms
of neurodevelopmental impairment. The research plan will provide the F32 candidate rigorous postdoctoral
training including training in 1) child neurodevelopmental assessment and research 3) content area expertise in
breastmilk research 3) advanced statistical methods of epidemiologic research 4) strengthen publication record
and communication skills."
10995632,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteosarcoma (OS) metastasis is the leading driver of mortality, but there are no therapies tailored to metastatic
disease. Despite the development of numerous treatment modalities targeting the primary tumor, 40% of pa-
tients still die from metastatic progression. Developing targeted therapies for metastatic OS has been compli-
cated by extensive genomic rearrangements that differ across patients, but a common feature is that OS tends
to metastasize to the lung. There is a pressing clinical need to determine the factors responsible for lung me-
tastasis in OS to facilitate development of novel antimetastatic therapies. Previous findings have demonstrated
the importance of alterations in enhancer activity and specific transcription factors in activating genes necessary
for metastasis. However, recent studies on epigenetic subtypes of OS suggest that many of the models studied
previously diverge from the epigenetic subtype of this disease most common and most deadly in the clinic.
Here we propose in aim 1 to study the transcription factors (RUNX2 and SP7) that are specific to the subtype of
OS that is most clinically relevant, and we plan to characterize how these create: de novo enhancer activation,
novel loops and clusters in cis and trans, and novel enhancer-gene connections that promote lung metastasis.
Our goal is to define “metastasis enabling circuitry”. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that the process of lung coloni-
zation is driven by an interplay between RUNX2 and signaling from the lung microenvironment through a longi-
tudinal series of dynamic chromatin state changes, each with unique gene dependencies. We seek to understand
the biology of the metastatic process by charting the chromatin state transitions and dependencies in osteosar-
coma cells growing within the in vivo context of the lung microenvironment. If successful, we hope to expand the
current arsenal of OS treatments beyond coverage of the primary lesion, to target tumor metastases during lung
colonization."
10994740,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Gametogenesis relies on a specialized cell division called meiosis, where homologous
chromosomes pair together, exchange genetic information through induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
and separate into haploid daughter cells. The sites of homologous recombination (HR) events in mammals,
called crossovers (COs), are determined by PRDM9, an H3K4/K36 methyltransferase. Recent evidence
highlights the significance of symmetric PRDM9-dependent modifications—chromatin modifications on both
homologs at the same genomic loci—for early inter-chromosomal pairing events and subsequent CO formation.
However, it remains unknown how the symmetric PRDM9-dependent modifications directly influence meiotic
homolog associations and downstream DSB repair. Our team and others have identified a dual H3K4/K36me3
reader, ZCWPW1, that may coordinate PRDM9-dependent modifications and downstream recombination.
Consistent with this model, Zcwpw1-/- males are sterile, with their spermatocytes displaying a failure to repair
DSBs and display chromosomal aberrations, including elevated rates of heterologous association. In contrast,
Zcwpw1-/- females, while initially fertile, become sterile at 6-8 months due to premature ovarian failure. Here we
will examine the role of ZCWPW1 in female meiosis. This milder phenotype in females allows us to define
ZCWPW1's role in homolog pairing and recombination and its contribution to meiotic prophase progression and
oocyte elimination or survival. To dissect the role of ZCWPW1 in homolog pairing and DSB repair, we propose a
comprehensive and integrative analysis of ZCWPW1 function using a series of genetic models and molecular
techniques. Overall, these studies will provide fundamental insights into female meiotic chromosome dynamics
and a mechanistic understanding of the role of ZCWPW1 in oocyte quality control and ovarian reserve
establishment and maintenance."
10996958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intellectual disability (ID), which affects approximately 1-3% of the human population, is characterized by
neurological deficiencies. Genetic forms of ID are often associated with an increased risk of obesity compared
to the general population and often individuals diagnosed with ID have various forms of metabolic defects.
Common metabolic defects include an increase in body fat, high triglyceride levels, and high blood sugar. The
underlying link(s) between neuronal dysfunction and metabolism are not yet clear. The Corbett and Moberg labs
co-discovered a non-syndromic autosomal recessive form of ID caused by mutations in the gene encoding an
evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed zinc-finger, polyadenosine RNA-binding protein (RBP),
ZC3H14. A Drosophila model has been invaluable to study the function of ZC3H14. Initial work revealed that
Nab2, the Drosophila orthologue of ZC3H14, while ubiquitously expressed, is required specifically in neurons to
support proper axon guidance, locomotion, and olfactory memory. Further studies identified a robust genetic
interaction between Nab2 and Mettl3, the catalytic component of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which
deposits the most abundant post-transcriptional modification on RNA. An unbiased RNA Seq analysis comparing
control and nab2 mutant flies identified a set of metabolic transcripts that are altered when Nab2 is lost. My
preliminary data reveal that loss of Nab2 causes increases both in lipid droplet size in the Drosophila fat body
(human adipose tissue equivalent) and the steady state levels of two metabolic transcripts: dilp2 and dilp5.
Drosophila insulin like peptides (Dilp), Dilp2 and Dilp5, are released from the insulin-producing cells in the brain
into the hemolymph where they travel to the fat body to regulate lipid storage and larval metabolism. As many
patients with ID also have various metabolic defects, my project investigates how loss of ZC3H14/Nab2 results
in metabolic dysfunction. Thus, I will test the hypothesis that the evolutionarily conserved RNA binding protein
Nab2 regulates lipid storage and mRNA transcripts critical for proper metabolic function. I will test this hypothesis
through the following complementary but independent specific aims: 1) Use lipidomics coupled with a cell-type
specific RNAi to define the effect of Nab2 loss on lipids in larvae; 2) Test the effect of Nab2 loss on dilp2/dilp5
mRNA levels and Pi3K/insulin signaling; and 3) Define cell-type specific requirement for Mettl3 in regulating lipid
droplet size and examine levels of m6A modifications on dilp2 and dilp5 in Nab2null larvae. Successful completion
of the proposed Aims will provide insights into novel molecular mechanisms of ZC3H14/Nab2 in regulating fat
storage and target RNAs critical for proper metabolic function. This proposal supports our long-term goal of
exploiting a Drosophila model of ID to understand how loss of an RBP in brain neurons can elicit physiological
changes in whole-body metabolism. The proposed collaborative project will provide me with exceptional training
to support my career development into an independent research scientist."
10984220,"Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of death and disability for which treatments are limited to reperfusion therapies, including intravenous thrombolytic (lytic) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Many patients are not candidates for these therapies, and amongst those who receive them, the rate of excellent outcome remains low; only 20-30% are free from disability at 3 months post-stroke. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop additional novel therapies for patients with AIS. Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (C-tDCS) is a non-invasive inhibitory neuromodulatory technique that applies a weak electrical current via scalp electrodes. In animal models of acute cerebral ischemia, C-tDCS salvages penumbra (ischemic tissue at risk of infarction), both through direct neuroprotection by inhibiting peri-infarct excitotoxicity and through collateral perfusion enhancement by inducing vasodilation. C-tDCS has many advantages; it is a regionally directed therapy that instantly reaches maximum local concentration, and via high-definition (HD) electrode montages, electrical field’s spatial focality can be enhanced to target each patient’s ischemic tissue only. In our pilot study using HD C-tDCS, we showed that HD C-tDCS can be efficiently applied in AIS, and we observed promising signals of beneficial effects upon imaging biomarkers of neuroprotection and collateral enhancement, including penumbral salvage, improved perfusion, and cerebral blood volume enhancement. Therefore, we propose conducting a multi-site (3 sites), phase 2a, randomized, sham-controlled, dose-optimization study of HD C-tDCS as a neuroprotective and collateral enhancing treatment for AIS with and without lytic. The primary aim of the study is to identify, among six HD C-tDCS dose tiers, an optimal dose regimen that shows adequate safety and efficacy using imaging. Up to 120 AIS patients with cortical strokes and salvageable penumbra who are ineligible for EVT will be enrolled from UCLA, Johns Hopkins, and Duke. According to lytic eligibility, patients will be enrolled either in the lytic-receiving or non-lytic group and subsequently randomized 5:1 to active stimulation vs. sham. The study utilizes an adaptive Bayesian design with bivariate endpoints as its escalation-de-escalation rules. The primary imaging safety rule of radiographic intracranial hemorrhage probability ≤40% and the primary imaging biomarker rule of substantial penumbral salvage probability ≥70% will determine the pace and occurrence of escalation-de-escalation through the dose regimens. Secondary objectives include the effect of HD C-tDCS on additional imaging efficacy biomarkers of neuroprotection and collateral enhancement (hypoperfusion region volume, cerebral blood volume, and infarct growth), and other safety/tolerability endpoints. We will also explore the clinical efficacy of HD C-tDCS. The study primarily aims to find an optimal dose that meets an adequate threshold of safety and efficacy for future testing in larger randomized phase 2b/3 clinical trials. If proven safe and efficacious, HD C-tDCS has the potential to be used as a standalone treatment in patients ineligible for reperfusion therapies and as a synergistic treatment, improving outcomes of AIS patients."
10984232,"This K23 application requests funds to develop and test a set of behavioral economics and financial incentive-
based strategies to improve patients' treatment engagement, medication adherence, and substance avoidance
as they transition from Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) for first-episode psychosis (FEP) to post-CSC care.
While CSC was conceived as a means to improve short-term and long-term outcomes, evidence suggests that
its short-term gains are lost after discharge. Improving treatment engagement, medication adherence, and
substance avoidance during post-CSC care promises to mitigate this loss of gains. Behavioral economic and
financial incentive-based behavior change strategies improve treatment plan adherence for people with other
health conditions, including general psychosis.
 But these interventions have not been tested in the post-CSC period, where they face two obstacles: (1)
frequent loss of contact in care transition and (2) concerns about the ethical acceptability of these interventions.
Yet, preliminary research suggests that text messaging and emerging mHealth apps like mindLAMP will increase
continued contact and that behavioral economic and financial incentive-based interventions will be acceptable
when designed in participatory, ethically-informed ways.
 I will pursue 3 research aims to develop ethically-informed behavioral economics and financial incentive-
based strategies to improve treatment plan adherence for people transitioning from CSC to post-CSC care.
Guided by principles of community-based participatory research, a Steering Committee involving stakeholders,
including CSC researchers, patients, family members, and clinicians, will oversee all aims. In Aim 1, I will assess
facilitators of and barriers to using behavioral economic and financial incentive-based strategies in the post-CSC
period. Using data from Aim 1, in Aim 2, I will adapt and sequentially improve these strategies while leveraging
text messaging and mindLAMP to monitor and reinforce patients' adherence. In Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot RCT
to examine preliminary effectiveness, utility of the measurement battery, success of recruitment and retention
strategies, and feasibility and acceptability of the intervention developed in Aim 2. I will also pursue training goals
in (1) decision science, (2) mHealth, (3) mixed methods analysis, and (4) field trials in order to become an
independent clinician-scientist and
psychosis
 a leader in the use of behavioral economics and financial incentives in
treatment and an expert in the ethical application of these strategies.
 Successful completion of these aims will lead to an R01 application to conduct an RCT testing effectiveness,
cost implications, and implementation issues. Related future research will apply similar methods to enhance
engagement and monitoring in other domains of psychosis care. Ultimately, the research and training plans in
this K23 will launch my career as an independent clinician-scientist and
and
leader in the use of behavioral economics
financial incentives in psychosis treatment and an expert in the ethical application of these strategies."
10984183,"Invasive aspergillosis (IA), caused by the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, is a leading infectious cause of death in
immunocompromised patients. A significant barrier to deciphering the mechanisms of pathogenesis and
developing effective antifungals is a lack of understanding of the regulation of A. fumigatus growth leading to
invasive disease. Cellular recycling mediated via autophagy-associated proteins is a key catabolic pathway and
critical to invasive fungal growth and virulence in the well-known nutrient-limited host environment. Protein kinase
A (PKA) is vital for growth and virulence of numerous fungal pathogens. However, the underlying basis for its
regulation of pathogenesis remains poorly understood in any species. Our A. fumigatus PKA-dependent whole
proteome and phosphoproteome studies employing advanced mass spectroscopic (MS) approaches identified
numerous previously undefined PKA-regulated proteins in catabolic pathways. Preliminary characterization of
two such novel direct PKA target proteins, Atg24 and Not4, demonstrated their requirement for A. fumigatus
virulence and also revealed functional importance of PKA-dependent phosphorylation of specific target sites. We
have identified and prioritized more than 30 autophagy-associated proteins as likely novel PKA-regulated
effectors, and will now characterize the top 6 priority proteins with regard to their roles in fungal growth and
pathogenesis, as well as their regulation by PKA. Our overall objective is to leverage our robust PKA whole
proteomic and phosphoproteomic data to define fungal-specific mechanisms of PKA control over autophagy
function and validate these PKA-regulated effectors’ novel contributions to fungal virulence. In Aim 1, we will
define PKA control over autophagy by validating PKA-dependent phosphorylation of prioritized
phosphoregulated effectors via MS analysis and expression-regulated effectors via qRT-PCR. We will
characterize the role of each PKA effector in fungal growth and stress responses through deletion and
phosphosite mutagenesis approaches. We will also perform structural elucidation of PKA-effector
phosphoregulation and function using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. In Aim 2, we
will validate the roles of PKA-regulated autophagy proteins in virulence and host-pathogen interaction using our
murine model of invasive aspergillosis to assess their impact on mortality, fungal burden and host lung tissue
damage via histological analysis. We will also assess the impact of PKA-regulated proteins on both the pathogen
and host response to infection by expression profiling of A. fumigatus autophagy marker genes, as well as
simultaneous examination of the host immune cytokine response during infection with wild-type and mutant
strains. PKA regulates catabolic processes critical to fungal growth, yet an understanding of PKA regulation of
autophagy pathways is lacking in any organism. We will define novel PKA-dependent regulation of newly-
identified fungal-specific autophagy-associated proteins and provide critical insight into future exploitation of
PKA-dependent control over A. fumigatus disease."
10992943,"Project 3: Project Summary
During pregnancy, sexual dimorphism can be seen throughout gestation. Sex-specific gene expression
differences are present in the preimplantation embryo, and term placenta show differences in the
transcriptome, the epigenome, histopathology and function. Sex-specific differences in adverse perinatal
outcomes have also been observed - male fetuses are at increased risk for certain perinatal complications and
more susceptible to some periconceptional and in utero exposures. Consistent with this data, we and others
have found sex-specific differences in phenotype and outcome after exposure to specific assisted reproductive
technologies (ART) interventions. Most recently, we demonstrated increased susceptibility of male human and
mouse placentas to epigenetic perturbation following embryo vitrification. These findings have led us to
hypothesize that sexually dimorphic trophoblast behavior and altered ART phenotypes occur due to the early
effects of sex chromosome complement and sex steroids on the placental epigenome and transcriptome.
However, our ability to study the cells and factors that control early pregnancy is limited by a lack of in vitro
models available to study the early events of human placentation, which includes placental trophoblast
differentiation, and trophoblast invasion. In this project, we propose using two innovative in vitro models
capable of quantifying changes in trophoblast function and epigenetic and transcriptomic perturbations, to carry
out a thorough examination of the sex-specific impact of ART interventions on early pregnancy. Specific Aim 1
will use an organ-on-chip device that recapitulates the maternal-fetal interface to examine how sex
chromosome complement and sex hormones regulate trophoblast invasion. We will also examine how this
regulation is affected by two ART-associated interventions, changes to the maternal hormonal environment
and oxygen concentration. In Specific Aim 2, using induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from control and
ART placenta, we will examine how sex impacts trophoblast differentiation, and the effect of ART and ART-
associated exposures on this process. These studies will leverage emerging, paradigm-shifting technologies to
explore the impact of sex on early pregnancy, a time-point that has so far been inaccessible. Results from the
proposed experiments will greatly advance our understanding of sexually dimorphic processes during
placentation and further our knowledge of the pathways involved in sexually dimorphic responses to ART
exposures, allowing us to modify protocols and develop interventional strategies to reduce adverse outcomes
that lead to significant morbidity and mortality in both mother and child."
10992944,"Project Summary
Mammalian germ cells undergo genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming during development. During this
process, retrotransposons (repetitive DNA elements) that account for ~40% of the mammalian genome are
transiently activated but subsequently become permanently silenced through multiple epigenetic mechanisms.
Although retrotransposons play important roles in genome evolution, their mobilization can be detrimental to
genome integrity and a failure to silence retrotransposons in germ cells can cause sterility. We previously
identified TEX15 as a testis-specific protein. In the previous funding period, we found that TEX15 is essential for
epigenetic silencing of retrotransposons in male germ cells. Furthermore, TEX15 is associated with a Piwi protein
in testis and functions as a nuclear effector for the piRNA pathway in retrotransposon silencing. TEX15 is a large
protein with a motif of unknown function. Our preliminary results have shown that TEX15 is associated with
chromatin-binding epigenetic factors. Importantly, we also found that loss of TEX15 or its interacting partner in
postnatal germ cells results in production of sperm with abnormal “mushroom” shaped head morphology. Thus,
we hypothesize that TEX15 regulates the epigenetic landscape of retrotransposons in male germ cells
and plays an important role in spermiogenesis through its associated chromatin modifiers. In this project,
we will 1) determine the epigenetic state associated with retrotransposon activation in Tex15-deficient male germ
cells and define the functional domains and genomic targets of TEX15 and 2) characterize the function of TEX15
and its associated chromatin-binding proteins in regulating gene expression critical for spermiogenesis. Finally,
human exome sequencing studies have shown that nonsense mutations in human TEX15 causes non-
obstructive azoospermia (NOA), a severe form of infertility in men. Strikingly, NOA patients frequently exhibit
heterogeneity in testicular histopathology, the causes of which are enigmatic. We for the first time propose
revertant mosaicism as a mechanism for heterogeneity in testicular histopathology in NOA men and plan to
model this human male infertility condition using our unique Tex15 revertant mosaicism mouse mutant. Together,
our genetic, genomic, and proteomic studies will elucidate the TEX15-mediated epigenetic program in silencing
of retrotransposons in germ cells and its role in spermiogenesis. These results will also have strong implications
in understanding human male infertility and provide guidance to treatment outcome consultation in IVF clinics."

10834233,"As patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) live to adulthood, the chronic impact of sustained hemolytic anemia 
and episodic vaso-occlusive events take their toll, with the progressive development of cardiopulmonary organ 
dysfunction. This culminates in the development of pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular diastolic heart 
disease, dysrhythmia, chronic kidney disease and sudden death, all major cardiovascular complications of SCD 
for which there are no approved or consensus therapies. The risk of having pulmonary hypertension and diastolic 
heart disease can be non-invasively assessed by laboratory tests (NT-proBNP) and Doppler-echocardiography 
(estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure). A recent meta-analysis of approximately 6000 patients with SCD
demonstrated that patients with elevated tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV), which is an Dopplerechocardiographic measurement that estimates the pulmonary artery systolic pressure, walked an estimated 
30.4 meters less in a 6 minute walk test than those without elevated TRV, and elevated TRV was associated 
with high mortality (hazard ratio of 4.9). In two large registry cohorts of adult patients with SCD, we found that 
approximately 20% of the adult SCD population have high values for both biomarkers, defined as a TRV ≥ 2.5 
meters per second AND a NT-proBNP ≥ 160 pg/mL, and that the 12-month mortality rate is 7.9% in this group 
as compared to 0.5% in patients with normal TRV or NT-proBNP values, with a risk ratio for hospitalization of 
1.6. This suggests that a simple screening profile of TRV and NT-proBNP can identify about 20% of patients 
with SCD at the highest risk of death and hospitalization. Given the increased mortality and early loss of 
functional capacity associated with cardiovascular disease in SCD adults, it is important to test effective 
therapeutic interventions in such patients. Red blood cell transfusions are administered by either simple or 
exchange transfusion, the latter removes the patients blood and replaces it with transfused red blood cells. 
Exchange transfusions have proven effective for acute treatment of almost all SCD complications, including 
severe acute chest syndrome, stroke, splenic or hepatic sequestration, and multi-organ failure, and are also 
used chronically for stroke prevention and recurrent acute chest syndrome. In this study we hypothesize that 
monthly exchange transfusion will limit disease progression, improve exercise capacity, and prevent interval 
episodes of vaso-occlusive painful crisis and the acute chest syndrome that acutely increases pulmonary 
pressures and cause right heart failure. We propose to perform a clinical trial to evaluate the effects of automated 
exchange blood transfusion on patient morbidity and mortality, compared to standard of care among 150 adult 
high risk SCD patients. The trial will leverage existing coordinating center infrastructure at the University of 
Pittsburgh and will involve 22 experienced clinical sites. Despite the safety and wide utilization of 
erythrocytapheresis in adult patients with SCD, there is no consensus or quality efficacy data on its use to 
improve outcomes in our aging high-risk SCD patients with progressive end-organ dysfunction."

Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling disorder that affects 15% of children and adolescents worldwide.
Adolescents with migraine frequently undergo changes in their disease symptoms during puberty, with
individuals experiencing increases, decreases, or no change in headache frequency. It is not currently possible
to predict if an individual will experience improvement, no change, or worsening of migraine symptoms, and the
underlying mechanisms controlling these changes remain uncharacterized. Thus, in the proposed study, we
aim to identify the baseline factors determining migraine prognoses in adolescents (Aim 1), determine the
hormonal, neural, and psychophysical changes related to migraine prognoses in adolescents (Aim 2a), and
identify the temporal relationships between hormonal, neural, and psychophysical changes preceding vs.
following changes in headache frequency (Aim 2b). Preliminary data support testosterone levels, conditioned
pain modulation (CPM) response, and functional connectivity (FC) of the amygdala as factors that may
determine migraine prognosis. Our preliminary data indicate that CPM response and amygdalar FC at baseline
may predict the change in headache frequency following a behavioral intervention in adolescents with
migraine. In addition, changes in testosterone levels are associated with changes in migraine symptoms. Study
participants will be adolescents with episodic migraine (ages 10–13, 50% females, migraine onset > 6 months,
headache frequency between 4–15/month, without or with a stable preventative treatment for migraine).
Psychophysical, neural, and hormonal factors will be assessed at baseline and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.
Participants will meet with a headache specialist at all study visits to confirm migraine diagnosis and for
rigorous characterization of migraine symptoms. Migraine outcomes will be categorized as an increase or
decrease (> 30%) or no change (< 30%) in headache frequency from baseline to 2-year follow-up. A healthy
control group will complete all study procedures to control for normal pubertal changes. We hypothesize that
male sex and greater CPM responses, lower amygdala-prefrontal cortex (PFC) FC, and higher testosterone
levels at baseline will be associated with a decrease in headache frequency after two years. We expect that
adolescents with increased headache frequency will have a greater reduction in CPM efficiency, increased
amygdala-PFC FC, and a smaller increase in testosterone levels compared to adolescents with a decrease or
no change in headache frequency and healthy adolescents. We expect smaller increases in testosterone
levels to precede increases in headache frequency and greater reductions in CPM efficiency and increases in
amygdala-PFC FC to follow increases in headache frequency. Characterizing the mechanisms underlying
changes in migraine symptoms is imperative for the development of new migraine treatments. Identification of
adolescents who are at risk of worsening migraine symptoms during puberty will facilitate the development of
personalized early-preventive strategies, which can reduce patient burden."

Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, remains one of the most prominent public health challenges today.
The combined efforts of the innate and adaptive immune system lead to the control of parasite and disease
burdens after infection. Macrophages and monocytes are key effector cells in the killing and removal of blood-
stage parasites. The production of IFN-g promotes the recruitment and activation of monocytes in the spleen
during the height of the T-cell mediated immune response against Plasmodium, leading to control of parasite
burden. However, less is known about the contribution of tissue-resident macrophages to the control of parasite
burden during the initial stages of the innate response before activation of the adaptive immune response. Nor
do we fully understand the transcription factors that regulate their activity. Here we confirm that myeloid cell
populations are essential for controlling early parasite growth in response to infection with the lethal murine P.
yoelii 17XL strain. Furthermore, we provide preliminary data showing that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 is
required to control early parasite burden after P. yoelii 17XL infection, as Bhlhe40-/- mice succumb to this infection
at a similar time as macrophage-depleted mice. Moreover, we provide evidence that splenic macrophages and
monocytes express Bhlhe40 after infection. Hence, we will test the hypothesis that Bhlhe40 regulates a
transcriptional program in these myeloid cells that is required for controlling parasite burden in response to P.
yoelii 17XL infection. We will test this hypothesis as part of two aims proposed here. Aim 1 will determine whether
Bhlhe40 expression in macrophages and monocytes is required to promote parasite control after infection with
P. yoelii 17XL. Aim 2 will determine how the loss of Bhlhe40 expression impacts the function of macrophages
and monocytes in response to infection with P. yoelii 17XL. Together these studies will elucidate a role for
Bhlhe40 expression in splenic macrophages and monocytes and determine how modulation of gene expression
by this transcription factor impacts the host immune response to infection."
10994899,"African Americans show a 3-fold higher risk of doxorubicin-cardiotoxicity than their White counterparts. Oxidative stress is a major underlying mechanism of dox-cardiotoxicity and is significantly aggravated in African American compared to their white counterparts suggesting a role in dox­ cardiotoxicity racial disparities. Our preliminary data identified EPHA2.AS1 as a novel gene that might regulate dox-cardiotoxicity. Importantly, race-specific SNPs in EPHA2-AS1 are associated with altered EPHA2 expression, calcium levels, and hepatic inflammatory markers. EPHA2.AS1 is located on the antisense strand adjacent to EPH receptor A2 (EPHA2). EPHA2 promotes mitochondrial dysregulation and 
oxidative stress and is upregulated during the pathogenesis of multiple diseases. Therefore, we hvaothesize that heart cells generated from African Americans are more p_rone to severe dox-induced cardiotoxicity than White Americans due to altered oxidative stress cardiac regulation and that EPHA2.AS1 regulates EPHA2 in the human heart, which dvsregulates cardiac mitochondria, exacerbating dox-induced cardiotoxicity. We will use a cohort of patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cell-cardiomyocytes derived from African and White Americans with and without dox-cardiotoxicity to examine ROS production, investigate their effect on dox-cardiotoxicity using our well-established biochemical and functional assays, reveal genes/pathways implicating their race-specific cardiac regulation using RNA-Seq, and screen for cardioprotective antioxidants in iPSC-cardiomyocytes and mice (Aim1). In Alm 2, we will define the role of EPHA2.AS1 in mitochondrial dysregulation-driven dox-cardiotoxicity racial disparities. We will use CRISPR-Cas9-generated EPHA2.AS1 KO, OE, and isogenic iPSC-cardiomyocytes to assess its effect on the severity of dox-cardiotoxicity and on EPHA2 regulation and signaling. Furthermore, we will use CRIPSR-Cas9 to introduce potential candidate EPHA2.AS1 race-specific SNPs in isogenic iPSC-cardiomyocytes followed by characterization of mitochondria dysregulation-driven dox-cardiotoxicity. Moreover, we will use an Epha2 KO mouse to assess the implication of Epha2 in dox-cardiotoxicity in vivo."
10996225,"The long-term goal of this program is to improve patient care by optimizing and validating quantitative
magnetic resonance imaging methods for the early prediction of brain cancer response to therapy. Currently,
contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) represents the standard for guiding almost all aspects of brain tumor clinical
management, including surgical biopsy/resection, radiation treatment planning, and post-treatment surveillance
for response assessment. Unfortunately, CE-MRI’s accuracy remains limited, which creates significant clinical
challenges. Thus, clinical decisions often require surgical biopsy for definitive diagnosis, which increases
medical costs, patient morbidity/mortality, and resource utilization. To overcome the limitations of CE-MRI,
dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI are increasingly used
to evaluate tumor perfusion and permeability. Studies have shown that DSC/DCE parameters correlate with
tumor grade, can predict the likelihood of tumor progression after therapy, and differentiate treatment related
effects versus tumor progression. However, the widespread clinical adoption and incorporation of DSC-MRI
into multi-site clinical trials has been hindered due to variable acquisition methods, contrast agent dosing
schemes and analysis protocols, which to date, have yet to be standardized and automated for clinical use.
These issues are known to affect the repeatability and interpretation of DSC-MRI metrics. Spin and gradient
echo (SAGE) DSC-MRI sequences enable the use of lower doses of Gd-based contrast agents, require less
scan time, are less sensitive to acquisition parameters, are methodologically more reproducible, yield more
accurate perfusion parameters, provide simultaneous measures of DCE-MRI, vessel size and vessel
architectural imaging data, oxygen delivery and novel metrics highly sensitive to tumor cellular characteristics.
Accordingly, SAGE methods enable the interrogation of unique and complementary readouts on tumor
microstructure and function that correlate with clinical outcomes and can identify patients responding to
therapy. Before clinical trials can benefit from SAGE based DSC-MRI the acquisition and analysis protocols
need to be optimized, automated and standardized. Thus, we propose to: 1) implement multi-vendor, SAGE-
DSC-MRI protocols, 2) establish automated and open source algorithms for quality assurance and analysis, 3)
partner with Imaging Biometrics to develop a commercially integrated, vendor neutral image analysis platform
for analyzing SAGE DSC-MRI data and 4) validate SAGE DSC-MRI tools for predicting glioma response to
bevacizumab therapy. Impact on Healthcare: We will provide the neuro-oncology community with validated,
quantitative image acquisition and analysis methods for identifying early therapeutic response that are
appropriate for multi-site clinical trials of conventional and targeted brain tumor therapies, thereby enabling
more rapid drug discovery and improved individualized care for patients."

Abstract Summary
 We propose to develop a “multi-polar stimulation” (MPS) module that is designed for
bipolar stimulation and stimulation of multi-polar nerve cuff electrodes. The MPS Module is an
upgraded module based on the platform COSMIIC System stimulator module. Each MPS can
drive any combination of four bipolar intramuscular and bipolar nerve cuff electrodes; or eight
monopolar intramuscular electrodes. Compared to the PG4, the MPS has expanded stimulation
channels (12 independent vs 4 monopolar) to accommodate additional electrode styles. Each
contact has an independent current source and allows full current steering between each
contact. The case of the MPS can also act as a return electrode, providing a total of 13
independent contacts. The MPS delivers a current-controlled, charge-balanced stimulus pulse
that is capable of delivering stimulation for any style of muscle-based electrodes (maximum
20mA pulse amplitude) as well as the stimulation resolution necessary for nerve cuff-based
electrodes (4μA resolution). The MPS includes impedance monitoring for each electrode.
Impedance monitoring allows identification of a broken electrode or lead disconnection, and
significantly enhances troubleshooting."

Current anti-seizure medications are insufficient for managing seizures in epilepsy patients, as they become less
effective over time and are associated with significant side effects. One promising molecular target for reducing
seizures is the SUR1-TRPM4 channel. This channel is a sodium conducting ion channel not significantly
expressed in healthy brain that upregulates de novo in neurons in other seizure-related disease pathologies such
as stroke and traumatic brain injury. SUR1-TRPM4 upregulation is a disease-specific pathologic mechanism that
has been successfully targeted and shown to be effective in reducing stroke pathology through preclinical studies
and clinical trials. Preliminary data demonstrate that SUR1-TRPM4 expression increases in neurons in epileptic
tissues resected from patients and in a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling rodent model of epilepsy. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition of SUR1-TRPM4 in vitro prevents neuronal population hyperactivity induced by low
Mg2+, and inhibiting SUR1-TRPM4 in vivo using pharmacologic inhibitors (glyburide, 9-phenanthrol) or genetic
knock-out (KO) globally or specifically in neurons attenuates the development of seizures induced by PTZ
kindling. This proposal aims to define the contributions of neuronal SUR1-TRPM4 expression to chronic seizure
activity by assessing the effects of neuron-specific SUR1-TRPM4 overexpression on neuronal hyperexcitability
in vitro and seizure susceptibility in vivo. This proposal fits the NINDS mission of reducing neurologic disease
burden, has rapid translatable potential due to the SUR1 inhibitor glyburide being FDA approved, and could
improve current anti-seizure medications by identifying a new epilepsy-specific therapeutic target not significantly
expressed in healthy brain tissue. This research will be conducted across two labs with specific expertise in the
SUR1-TRPM4 channel and epilepsy at a state-of-the-art institution in the University of Maryland School of
Medicine. I will gain valuable experience in molecular and electrophysiologic techniques, particularly for inducing
protein overexpression and data collection and analysis of neuronal firing via calcium imaging and
electroencephalogram (EEG). Toward that end, this project will continue my development towards my ultimate
career goal of becoming an independently funded neurosurgeon-scientist focused on translational and clinical
research in epilepsy."

advances in crystallography and cryo-EM, there are no structures of SERCA bound to small-molecule activators,
so the structural mechanisms for small-molecule activation of SERCA are still unclear; (2) Existing sodium pump
modulators are primarily cardiotonic steroids that have a narrow therapeutic window and pro-arrhythmia
cardiotoxic effects at therapeutically relevant doses. To overcome these challenges, we will use experimental
and computational approaches to determine the structural mechanisms for small-molecule activation of SERCA
and to discover new non-cardiotoxic, lead-like inhibitors of NKA. The proposal is significant because it will
produce new mechanistic insights and small-molecule effectors targeting two major clinically relevant targets
in the heart. The research is translational because it will expedite the discovery of lead molecules targeting
cardiac pumps. We will pursue the following independent aims: (1) Determine the mechanisms and interactions
for small-molecule SERCA activators, and (2) Discover novel non-cardiotoxic NKA inhibitors for congestive heart
failure. We have performed preliminary studies that show the feasibility of the proposed research, including
fresh evidence showing that small-molecule SERCA activation involves both a structural and a kinetic
mechanism, and the discovery of a novel potent NKA inhibitor with a safe pro-arrhythmia cardiac toxicity profile."

The mechanisms involved in lung repair and regeneration are still poorly understood and currently no clinical
techniques are available to specifically induce lung repair. In young tissues, the lung is appreciated to repair and
regenerate in response to damage. However, lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are largely
considered diseases of aging and subsequent disordered repair. Current treatment options available are limited,
and mainly provide an option to slow disease progression, but none offer the ability to repair existing damage.
Improved understanding of repair and regenerative mechanisms could drastically improve the treatment options
available for these terminal fibrotic conditions. Of the cells studied in repair and regeneration, mesothelial cells
are largely excluded, presenting a gap in the knowledge base. While pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) are largely
quiescent in healthy conditions, our preliminary data shows recruitment and migration of PMCs in a mouse model
of transient fibrotic injury. Compelling data also exists for PMC recruitment and migration in a mouse model of
lung regeneration. Contradicting this, other work has suggested that PMCs serve a role to stimulate fibrotic
progression, leading to confusion surrounding the function of these cells. The lack of study and contradictory
evidence regarding PMC functions in lung injury, fibrosis and repair sets the stage for detailed study of this cell
population and the signaling and functional roles it may play in these contexts. Using a combination of careful
lineage-tracing experiments, we will investigate PMCs in the bleomycin injury model, as well as in the
pneumonectomy compensatory growth and regeneration model. We will subsequently collect these cells for
further genomic analysis to assess expression of genes consistent with injury progression or controlled repair.
Our initial investigations into the signaling of PMCs has capitalized on the various lung single-cell RNA
sequencing dataset that are publically available. In multiple human and mouse datasets, the cell clusters
identified as mesothelium represent the exclusive lung cell type that expresses the Wnt mediator R-spondin 1
(Rspo1). Our preliminary data confirms PMC to be highly expressive of Rspo1. As Wnt signaling is a pathway
that has been well explored in contexts of injury and repair, this proposal will explore the ability of PMCs to
modulate Wnt signaling in the local environment but using organoid co-culture. The goal of these studies is to
provide context for the effect of these cells on specific cell types involved in lung injury and repair. Overall, the
studies may reveal a unique and unexplored potential to target pleural mesothelial cells and explore their
expanded role in lung function/dysfunction."

The destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) towers on September 11, 2001 resulted in the massive release
of dust and fumes with exposure of local community members (“survivors”) to carcinogenic compounds
(asbestos, metals, and dioxins). It is well known that environmental exposures can cause somatic mutations and
aberrant DNA methylation which, in turn, are known to be associated with cancer initiation and progression.
There have been a rapid increased of the number of cancers among community members affected by the terrorist
attack on the WTC towers on September 11, 2001. Studies of cancers from the FDNY and General Responders’
group report elevated cancer incidence in prostate cancers and other solid tumors among men. Importantly,
there are also several studies of WTC Responders enrolled in WTCHP medical monitoring and treatment
programs (MMTP) that find significantly lower mortality rates compared to national peer groups mortality rate.
These are important findings, however, the members of the FDNY and general responders are predominately
limited to white males thus lack the necessary diversity in gender, socioeconomic and race/ethnicity to fully
understand breast cancers and other leading cancers in the affected urban community. Studies performed by
the NYCDOH WTC Health Registry report increased cancer incidence rate in women’s breast cancers among
community members, but are based on epidemiological data from survey questionnaires thus lack of individual
level clinical information. Moreover, there has been no investigation on the link between the complex WTC
exposures and the phenotypes and mortality of cancers in WTC Survivors enrolled in the WTC Environmental
Health Center (EHC), Williams Street Clinic (WSC) and National Provider Network (NPN), the CDC/NIOSH
designated treatment and monitoring program for affected community members (i.e. survivors). In particular, the
enrollees of WTC EHC include about 50% women and have diverse social-economic status and racial/ethnic
background. To fill the important knowledge gaps and to improve disease surveillance, diagnosis and treatment
activities for cancer among affected community, we propose to conduct integrated analyses of individual-level
patient data to investigate the link between WTC exposures and certified WTC cancers at the WTC EHC and to
measure cancer mortality in survivors. We will systematically examine WTC exposures and other risk factors
and associations with breast cancer characteristics and cancer survival outcomes. Successful completion of this
project will establish the link between elevated WTC exposures with combination of other risk factors and
characteristics of breast cancers, and characterize effects of risk factors associated with breast cancer stage,
subtypes, and overall survival among community members affected by the WTC terrorist attack, which can inform
subsequent studies and improve surveillance and treatment of the WTC-exposed population."

Historically, venoms have acted as a ‘double-edged sword’ in their impacts on human health. Snake venoms are
complex cocktails of bioactive toxins that have been a prolific source of pharmacologically useful molecules for
antibacterial, anticancer, pain management, and cardiac/hematological drug discovery and development. For
example, cathelicidin from the Colubrinae snake species Sinonatrix annularis, serves as a critical effector in host
immune response against microbial infections. At the same time, snakebite envenomation has been recently
reinstated to the list of category A Neglected Tropical Diseases by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a
3-5% risk of mortality and documented long-term, multi-organ effects after initial injury. Furthermore, three-
quarters of snake bite victims develop secondary mono or poly-microbial envenomation wound infections,
although the source of infection is still unknown. Recent studies have revealed a diverse venom microbiome,
which is distinct from the oral microbiota. Venom microbes are thought to be opportunistic colonizers, as the
snake fang and venom gland are structurally comparable to a clinical catheterization assembly which is open to
the environment and the snake oral cavity. Advances in DNA sequencing and genome mining have revealed
stress-adapted metabolism pathways in venom-associated bacterial isolates that may allow for their persistence
in the venom microenvironment. However, there has been no investigation of the full bacterial community
composition or specialized bacterial metabolites which may play a role in the venom toxin cocktail. In our
research, we aim to characterize the genomic and taxonomic diversity of bacteria in the venom gland and
understand the chemical diversity and activity of molecules produced by venom-associated bacteria. Throughout
this study, we will bridge field, laboratory, and computational studies using multi-omic and bioassay techniques
to understand the biosynthetic potential of bacteria identified in venom. Moreover, we will identify bioactive
molecules in venom-derived bacteria that have been underexplored. Overall, we hypothesize that venom-
associated bacteria hold the potential to produce bioactive compounds that pose an underexplored risk to human
health and immense chemical potential. We anticipate these efforts will add to the growing body of evidence
exploring the venom microbiome and assist with future public health guidelines for snakebite treatment."

The goal of this Mentored Career Development Award is to facilitate the primary investigator's transition to
independence as a physician-scientist studying the molecular mechanisms underlying brain injury that occurs
after a cardiac arrest. The candidate is a MD/PhD critical care physician and anesthesiologist with a
background in neurodegenerative and brain injury research. The award will help the candidate gain research
experience in the analysis of neuronal cell death pathways and brain inflammation, measurement of synaptic
function, and assessment of cognition in mouse models of cardiac arrest. The environment in which the
proposed research will be conducted is outstanding, and includes structured mentorship from neuroscientists
and physician-scientists with diverse backgrounds. The candidates mentor and co-mentor, Dr. Nidia Quillinan
and Dr. Elizabeth J. Kovacs, are well-respected experts in the fields of cardiac arrest, global cerebral ischemia,
aging research, and inflammation. The proposed research will investigate the role of inflammasome pathways
as molecular mediators of age-related differences in brain injury after global cerebral ischemia induced by a
cardiac arrest. The incidence of cardiac arrest dramatically increases with age, with older survivors having a
worse neurologic prognosis and poor response to post-arrest care. A potential cause of worsening brain
dysfunction after a cardiac arrest in older individuals is age-associated inflammation (inflammaging). Activation
of the inflammasome multi-protein complex is a primary driver of inflammaging and has been shown to mediate
cognitive deficits in both brain injury and disease. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that global
cerebral ischemia results in a more robust and sustained inflammasome activation with advanced age that
results in increased cell death and synaptic deficits in survivors. In order to test this hypothesis, the primary
investigator will use a murine model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) to (Aim 1)
assess for age-related differences in inflammasome-mediated inflammation after global cerebral ischemia and
(Aim 2) evaluate the extent to which inflammasome activity contributes to CA/CPR induced neuronal cell loss,
acute deficits in synaptic function, and cognitive impairment in young and advanced age mice. The proposed
experiments are designed to elucidate a novel aging-relevant molecular mechanism involved in the brain's
response to global cerebral ischemia. This career development award will provide the primary investigator with
valuable research training relevant to the realms of ischemia, aging biology, and inflammation that will
complement his clinical management of cardiac arrest survivors in the intensive care unit, and ultimately
provide a skill set for the translation of basic science discoveries into novel therapeutic strategies for patients
that suffer a cardiac arrest."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia are devastating neurodegenerative disorders. Despite intensive
investigations, there remains an urgent need to identify the root cause of AD in order to develop efficacious
treatment regimens. SNX19 plays a role in endolysosomal and autophagy pathways, extensively correlated with
neuronal dysfunction and neurodegenerative diseases. Although genetic and cellular evidence suggest SNX19
contributes to neuropathology, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we propose to study the
mechanism in aging postmortem brain tissue at the single-cell resolution and model SNX19 in human induced
pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) derived brain organoids. Using single molecule in situ hybridization experiments,
SNX19 was found to be highly expressed in neurons, particularly excitatory neurons, compared to glia in human
postmortem brains. Our single-nucleus RNA-seq data further demonstrated that SNX19 gene expression is
significantly associated with neuritic plaques in excitatory neurons in postmortem brains. In Aim 1, we propose
to study the link between SNX19 and AD-related pathologies (i.e., neurofibrillary tangle, cognitive impairment)
across six major cell types. Despite the development of animal and in vitro models for AD, they fail to fully
recapitulate all essential aspects of the disease. Brain organoids developed from hiPSCs provide an ideal
experimental model to delineate underlying AD biology before the onset of symptoms. The application of
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in iPSCs offers an unprecedented opportunity to functionally assess the role of
SNX19 in affecting neuronal phenotypes. By using genetically modified organoid models, we aim to take the first
crucial step to define neuronal function and the AD-related pathologies associated with SNX19. Our preliminary
data show that SNX19 knockout can increase synaptic markers’ expression in hiPSC-derived neurons and brain
organoids. Our findings implicate aberrant synaptic processes in the underlying AD pathophysiology. Hence, we
propose to assess the impact of SNX19 on synaptic density using the 3D brain organoid model. Given that
SNX19 regulates the endolysosome system, we will test the hypothesis that autophagy might be activated in
SNX19 depletion lines to clear the accumulation of aggregated proteins. We have also observed reduced calcium
responses in co-cultured astrocytes due to SNX19-null organoids. Intracellular calcium levels and glutamatergic
hypofunction are well-established signaling in AD pathogenesis. Accordingly, we will test the hypothesis that
SNX19 impacts neuronal hyperactivity through the overactivation of synapses. Our work integrates techniques
in imaging and biochemistry with rigorous experimental designs using isogenic-engineered hiPSCs from both
genders, and the differentiation of organoids with defined synaptic characteristics. Our research findings will
provide mechanistic insights into the molecular and cellular roles of SNX19 in neurodegenerative diseases."
10984598,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disorder that affects 2.8 million people worldwide. MS is characterized by loss of myelin, the structure surrounding nerves necessary for efficient communication between neurons and critical to neurodevelopment, maintenance, and plasticity. The severe symptoms that arise as MS progresses are exacerbated by the loss of oligodendrocytes—the myelin-producing cells—and impaired differentiation of their precursor, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). To understand why remyelination fails in MS, we first need to comprehend the mechanisms driving the proliferation and differentiation of myelin-forming precursors. OPCs are the most abundantly mitotic cells in the brain and maintain strict, homeostatic boundaries, indicative of a precision in cell cycle control but also an ability to maintain elaborate tiling throughout the brain despite an ever-changing microenvironment. Oligodendroglia dynamics require the precise timing of transcription factors (TFs) expression, that is essential for efficiently remyelinating lesions. This suggests a large range in dynamic plasticity, a characteristic afforded to cells by the circadian (~24 hour) clock system, a transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop driven by the transcription factors BMAL1 and CLOCK that regulates up to 50% of the mammalian transcriptome. While much is known about the vital role of circadian rhythms in neurons, comparatively little is known about their role in oligodendroglial cells. There is still a significant gap in our knowledge of the genetic mechanisms through which BMAL1 and other TFs control OPC differentiation during myelination. My central hypothesis is that the dynamic nature of myelin-forming glia fostered by BMAL1 and other master transcriptional regulators can be used to enhance myelination. This is based on my data in which Bmal1 loss in OPCs results in transcriptional dysregulation, aberrant OPC dynamics and myelination. These data strongly suggest the necessity of BMAL1 in OPC differentiation and myelination. To test this hypothesis, my approach will be to: 1) Characterize the role of BMAL1—the only single clock factor necessary for circadian rhythmicity—in OPC transcriptional regulation during neurodevelopment through single-cell RNAseq and CUT&Tag using our established conditional clock knockout that lacks Bmal1 in OPCs; 2) Evaluate the recovery of the differentiation potential of OPCs that lack Bmal1 by modifying signaling pathways that act downstream of BMAL1; 3) Study the transcriptional control of regulators of human OPC differentiation through a CRISPR screen in human OPCs to discover enhancers. My goal is to identify new regulatory mechanisms of OPC differentiation into myelin-forming cells, starting with the role of BMAL1 in OPC dynamics, and continuing with genomic elements that control OPC differentiation. With the K99/R00 Award, I will obtain the training to prepare me for a lifelong independent research career in genetic regulation of myelin-forming precursors. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate myelin-forming precursors will impart unique insights into normal and aberrant myelination and have a positive impact on developing new therapeutics to restructure myelin in MS."

This program is focused on developing a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by advancing our
lead compound into clinical development. There are no disease-modifying small molecule drugs for AD, and the
prevalence of AD is increasing worldwide. This program is progressing to fill this need with a disease modifying
drug that, if successful, will have a tremendous impact on the more than 6.7 million Americans who currently
have AD (projected to be 13.8 million by 2060) and their caregivers, and will help reduce the current cost of $345
billion (projected to be $1.1 trillion by 2050) to our nation (Alzheimer's Association 2023 Alzheimer's Disease
Facts and Figures). Key requirements for treating early-stage AD include safe, efficacious, and cost-effective
therapeutic interventions. This small molecule, CNS drug-like lead significantly fulfills these requirements based
on our preliminary results. This highly differentiated tau self-association inhibitor targets tau self-association at
the beginning of the tau aggregation cascade. Small molecules were screened and optimized using in vitro
assays to select molecules that inhibit the formation of tau oligomers from tau monomers. In vitro pharmacology
studies and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice were used to select a lead compound for evaluation of in vivo
efficacy. Preventive and therapeutic studies in two mouse models of tauopathy, representing tau aggregation in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and four-repeat-tau tauopathies, demonstrated proof-of-concept and supported the
selection of this compound for further development. Methods development and manufacture of 1.61 kg of the
lead compound was completed for non-clinical safety studies. GMP manufacture of a 2.8 kg batch of drug
substance for initial clinical studies was completed, and pre-formulation studies for development of drug product
were completed. The IND was submitted (June 1, 2022) for first in human (FIH) studies that initiated in early
2023. The awarded Phase 1a study is a double-blind, randomized, three-part study designed to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the tau self-association inhibitor, in single ascending doses, multiple
ascending doses, and single doses in healthy elderly. This Supplement is to cover unanticipated incremental
costs related to project delays directly attributable to FDA requests for additional toxicology data on the
compound prior to progressing to higher doses in human volunteers. The Aims of this one-year supplement are
as follows: Aim 1. GMP Manufacture of additional batches of capsules, at two different strengths, using
established process and formulation to provide additional clinical supplies. It is urgent that these activities be
supported and started as soon as possible as currently available clinical supplies will reach their expiry date prior
to the anticipated date of completion of clinical activities. Any delay in providing this support will result in a delay
to completing clinical activities for the studies supported by this grant."

Left ventricular assist device support is standard therapy for patients with advanced, life-threatening heart failure.
However, current-generation impeller-based blood pumps have introduced a new “non-pulsatile” physiology with
frequent adverse events. Lack of pulsatility contributes to blood trauma, endothelial and arterial remodeling, and
abnormalities in vasoregulation that predispose patients to bleeding, thrombosis, diastolic hypertension, and
stroke. Cyclic speed modulation in which device impeller speed is rapidly increased/decreased has been
developed to generate pulsatile blood flow. This emerging technology has potential to combine durability of
impeller-driven devices with physiologic benefits of pulsatility in order to reduce adverse events and improve
quality of life for patients with artificial circulation devices. To date, no investigation has characterized
(patho)physiologic effects of total-body pulsatile versus non-pulsatile blood flow with the same device. The
BiVACOR total artificial heart is a first-of-its-kind, impeller-based total artificial heart with the ability to generate
continuous (non-pulsatile) or pulsatile blood flow through cyclic impeller speed modulation. In a chronic bovine
model, we propose to investigate in vivo effects of non-pulsatile versus pulsatile flow with the BiVACOR on blood
trauma, arterial remodeling, and vasoregulation. We anticipate that compared to non-pulsatile support, pulsatile
flow will 1) reduce blood trauma, 2) prevent pathologic changes in endothelial and arterial wall architecture and
function, and 3) maintain normal vasoregulation during postural changes, transition to exercise, sleep, and other
activities of daily living. Data will provide insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms of adverse events in patients
with impeller-based blood pumps. Findings will also be useful for the development of artificial pulsatility
algorithms that mimic physiologic pulsatility in order to minimize blood trauma, prevent arterial remodeling, and
appropriately modulate vasomotor tone during daily activities."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a debilitating and incurable muscle wasting disease caused by
inherited mutations in the Dmd gene, which encodes the muscle structural protein Dystrophin. Therapeutic
approaches that seek to cure DMD must include a strategy to repair or replace the mutant Dystrophin protein.
A recent series of papers from my lab and others demonstrated the potential feasibility of using adeno-
associated virus (AAV) mediated delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases to make site specific DNA cleavages in
the Dmd gene within skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyoctyes and muscle stem cells of living animals. We have
shown that this in vivo gene editing strategy is sufficient to restore Dmd reading frame and enable production
of functional Dystrophin protein that can increase muscle specific force and protect DMD muscle from
contraction-mediated damage. This strategy presents some advantages with respect to other “exon skipping”
approaches, in that it allows efficient recovery of Dystrophin protein in both the skeletal muscle and heart, and,
because it effectively targets muscle stem cells and irreversibly modifies the Dmd locus, it offers potentially
permanent restoration of Dystrophin expression in dystrophic tissues.
Yet, despite its promise, there remain significant potential challenges for clinical application of in vivo gene
editing. In particular, the bacterially-derived Cas9 nuclease represents a potential antigenic target for the host
immune response. In fact, our preliminary data indicate that Cas9 is rapidly and robustly recognized by the
immune system when ectopically expressed in the muscle of immune competent mice. In addition, analyses of
human sera indicate that more than half of potential human recipients of Cas9 therapies harbor pre-existing
antibody and T cell responses to Cas9 orthologs due to prior infection with the bacteria from which these
proteins derive. Thus, induced or pre-existing anti-Cas9 immune responses may lower the efficiency of
therapeutic gene editing in muscle by causing the immune-mediated elimination of Cas9 transduced, gene-
edited cells. Moreover, emerging data indicating that the immune system and its products can modulate the
expression of AAV-encoded transgenes and of components of cellular DNA damage response pathways raise
the possibility that anti-Cas9 immunity could alter both the degree of on-target Dmd editing as well as the
frequency and types of off-target modifications induced.
In this project, we will test the hypotheses that robust anti-Cas9 responses reduce the production and
durability of gene-edited cells and alter the frequency of potentially genotoxic edits, whereas opposing Cas9
immunity through genetic or pharmacologic manipulation will increase the efficiency, safety and durability of
Dystrophin recovery by gene editing. This work will establish whether the anti-Cas9 immune response helps or
hinders in vivo gene editing and will be critically important for the design of future clinical efforts using this
approach."

evaluate therapeutic response. Cellular metabolism involves a vital network of pathways for homeostasis,
growth, and survival and can shift from one nutrient pathway to another based on the extent of perfusion available
to the cells. Interest in cellular metabolism and tissue vasculature continues to expand across a broad range of
disciplines including neuroscience, cardiovascular biology, and the field of cancer research. Though there are
many bench-top microscopes and metabolic tools available to provide exquisite resolution and contrast for
metabolic or vascular imaging, these systems require extensive training and often have fields of view (FOV),
resolution, and wavelengths that fit only the most common use cases. Further, they require researchers to
transport animals to specialized facilities, and this limits access to longitudinal imaging. Additionally, there are
surprisingly few biomedical imaging technologies available to image both the global landscape and local spatial
variations of metabolic and vascular hallmarks in vivo. We propose to develop an optical imaging platform the
Capillary-Cell or CapCell to permit studies of metabolic reprogramming and heterogeneity across the laboratory
to clinical continuum. This technology will report on the major axes of metabolism, blood vessel architecture and
morphology of different biological systems including organoids and xenograft mouse models. Our work will lead
to the establishment of predictive biomarkers to support drug development, inform on drug choices and evaluate
the efficacy of drugs in bench research and in patients. The technology will be portable and turnkey and therefore
can be placed in individual labs instead of a central dedicated facility. This is essential to putting new biomarker
capabilities directly into the hands of laboratory scientists. The clinical translatability of the CapCell will focus on
breast cancer therapies. The CapCell will inform the selection of compounds for personalized management of
cancer patients in adaptive clinical trials and ultimately those in a standard clinical setting. Further, it will enable
the identification of successful drugs early in their development, thereby accelerating market approval for
candidate therapies. Lastly, this technology will be instrumental in understanding metabolic heterogeneity during
primary cancer formation and invasion and its modulation by oncogenic driver mutations and their inhibition. The
biological models will include human organoids and mouse models developed at UCSF. Patient-derived
organoids (PDO) will serve as a bridge between patients and mouse models – they can be created from patient
samples, and they can then be engrafted into mice, and Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models can be used
to identify dynamic biomarkers associated with the risk of recurrence."

In the previous period, we have used national and state microsimulation modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis,
legal and policy analyses, and real-choice experiments to elucidate the health, equity, and cost impacts of

the most promising interventions to be Food is Medicine (FIM) strategies: incorporation of food-based
nutritional interventions into healthcare to improve food and nutrition security, treat disease, and reduce health
disparities. Such programs include medically tailored meals or produce prescriptions for patients with specific
disease conditions, complemented by nutrition and culinary education, and often focused on populations with
adverse social determinants of health (SDOH) from low-income or racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. Yet,
critical questions remain, each identified and crystalized by our findings and interactions in the prior project
period with key stakeholders such as healthcare sector leaders; government officials; patients, doctors, and
other care providers; and FIM non-profit providers and private sector entrepreneurs. This new project will
leverage the deep learnings and networks established in our prior project period to address the following
critical aims: 1) to estimate the health, equity, and cost impacts of varying FIM program design options,
including key elements of dose ($/mo), food groups, duration, and disease targets; 2) to assess intersections of
FIM with other levels of healthcare interventions including (a) coordinated food insecurity screening and SNAP
enrollment, and (b) new clinical drug treatments; 3) to investigate the administrative and legal feasibility of
pathways for scaling FIM; and 4) to disseminate top findings to relevant scientific, healthcare, legislative,
agency, and advocacy stakeholders. To achieve these aims, we will leverage our prior work on the etiologic
effects of dietary changes and our validated national microsimulation model to estimate CMD benefits, costs,
and cost-effectiveness, and further develop and validate our model to incorporate (a) food insecurity as a risk
for health and cost outcomes, (b) the additional, non-CMD QALYs and costs of BMI as a risk; and (c) the
health and cost effects of novel drug treatments (e.g., GLP-1 agonists). Effects on health disparities will be
estimated using both difference-in-difference measures and semi-quantitative measures of disparity. We will
perform new landscape, stakeholder, and legal analyses of (a) reimbursement coverage of FIM in Medicare
and Medicaid; (b) integration of FIM into rapidly accelerating SDOH modules in EMR and clinical care
pathways; and (c) pathways to align consumer education and communication, like SNAP-Ed and FDA food
labeling, with a FIM approach. This will include qualitative research into legal authorities and limitations; and
research among key stakeholders (e.g. patients/public, private and federal health systems, government)
through surveys and mixed methods research."
10980727,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Compelling evidence from human epidemiological studies and model systems indicate that many adult diseases
can be traced to deficits far earlier in development. As many cell lineages are supported by resident stem cells
throughout adulthood, disruptions in the stem cell formation can have lasting impacts that manifest as a number
of diseases or cancer. Our goal is to use the male germline as a model to better understand the process by
which developmental precursors form tissue-specific stem cells that will ultimately support cell lineages long into
adulthood. The critical factors that promote establishment of germline stem cells, that lead to adult infertility if
disrupted, remain unknown. Thus, the field lacks a clear picture of the developmental regulators that coordinate
stem cell formation. Modern technological advances such single-cell ‘omics approaches have begun annotating
the complexities of germline stem cell formation to determine the essential players, but the functional networks
are not clear. Here, we have integrated single-cell ‘omics approaches and identified the RUNX family as a set of
transcription factors that are integral for prepubertal development in the male germline. Our recently published
work determined that disruption of the RUNX family leads to failures in both self-renewing and differentiation
functions with the male germline during prepubertal development. How the RUNX family accomplishes this
balance of two opposing fates remains unknown, but our preliminary studies suggest that each function is
coordinated by different members of the RUNX family. Thus, in Specific Aim 1, we will functionally evaluate the
roles of RUNX1 and RUNX3 in balancing germ cell fate towards either proliferation and self-renewal or
differentiation. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate how the RUNX family accomplishes this balance despite having
largely overlapping consensus binding motifs for DNA and a common co-factor in CBFb. Finally, Specific Aim 3
will explore the fate of RUNX1- and RUNX3-labeled germ cells through lineage tracing approaches. Collectively,
elucidating the mechanisms that establish and balance fate in the germline has the potential to translate into
diagnostic, prevention, or treatment avenues for infertility with developmental origins. Furthermore, RUNX
proteins are not unique to the germline and instead, span other stem cell-based lineages as well. Thus, we
anticipate that our findings will contribute fundamental knowledge for a greater understanding of how tissue-
specific stem cells balance fate and function across multiple lineages."
10981241,"Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs) are a combination of an extracellular single-chain variable fragment region
(scFV) that recognizes tumor protein antigens in an MHC independent manner and an intracellular region that
transduces extracellular stimuli similar to T Cell Receptor (TCR) signaling. Optimization of CAR constructs is of
high importance as current CAR therapies have significant drawbacks including CAR T cell toxicity from severe
cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and lack of CAR T cell persistence in vivo and expansion in vitro. There
is a new focus on tuning CAR intracellular signals via the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs
(ITAMs) to increase effector function and persistence. Each of the 3-zeta chain ITAM sequences are unique with
distinct kinetics of phosphorylation including a hierarchy of specificity for Zap-70 upon phosphorylation. Our
previous work determined that ITAM diversity was necessary for T cell development and attenuating TCR
signaling. Importantly, ITAM diversity has also been shown to be necessary for TCR-driven proliferation and
cytokine production. However, the role of CAR zeta chain diversity in CAR signaling, persistence and function
has not been fully explored.
Interactions between TCR and pMHC occur at the interface of two cells in a two-dimensional (2D) membrane
microenvironment. Initial binding events including affinity and kinetics of the TCR/pMHC interaction, and the
CAR/protein epitope interaction, will dictate binding stability and downstream signaling events including
phosphorylation of the ITAMs. We have found that CARs expressing specific ITAM sequences (zeta-AAA, zeta-
BBB or zeta-CCC) generate differing amounts of Force and bond lifetime after interacting with CD19. Therefore,
a CAR may act as a mechanosensor similar to a TCR discriminating the quality of the interaction with antigen
as cellular derived forces are applied to the bond. Mechanistically, we hypothesize that finetuning the
combination of ITAM sequences will differentially regulate bond lifetime, phosphorylation and signal transduction
leading to differential immune activation depending on the ITAM motif. Understanding the biology of ITAM
specificity has important implications in “tuning” the activation of a CAR T cell without changing specificity."
10981989,"Up to one third of women, up to a billion people, experience the emergence or worsening of depressive
and anxiety (mood) symptoms as their hormonal milieu shifts into perimenopause. Despite this proportion, we
still do not understand what biological changes in perimenopause contribute to the increased risk of symptoms.
Recent work suggests that perimenopause initiates a proinflammatory state and links both follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) and acyl-ghrelin, two peripheral hormones that can cross the blood-brain barrier, to negative
health outcomes. The roles of FSH and acyl-ghrelin extend beyond their canonical links to fertility and hunger,
respectively. FSH receptors and ghrelin receptors are observed in many tissues and cells, including immune
cells. FSH receptors are highly expressed in monocytes and FSH receptor activation stimulates proinflammatory
cytokine production. Ghrelin receptors are expressed in the efferent vagus nerve, a well-known anti-inflammatory
component of the autonomic nervous system, and acyl-ghrelin signaling increases vagal activity. Despite these
observations, the hormonal mechanisms leading to mood symptoms remain elusive because the convergent
hormonal pathways linking perimenopausal inflammation and mood symptoms have not been modeled.
 Our goal is to compare the time course of changes in FSH, estradiol, other reproductive hormones and
acyl-ghrelin with the time course of changes in inflammation and mood. The study tests a mechanistic hypothesis
in which elevated FSH and decreased acyl-ghrelin elevate proinflammatory markers through actions on
monocytes and the autonomic nervous system, and thereby increase depressive and anxiety symptoms. This
is a prospective longitudinal case-control study using a surgical menopause model, i.e. risk-reducing bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). Surgical menopause reduces inter-individual variation in the onset and duration
of perimenopause, thus facilitating our ability to measure associations between hormones, inflammation, and
vagal activity pre- and post-menopause. We will recruit women seeking premenopausal risk-reducing BSO and
age-matched premenopausal “controls” having non-BSO gynecological surgery. We will collect endocrine,
immune and other measures pre-surgery, one week post-surgery and monthly post-surgery up to six months.
 Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mood symptoms change with surgical menopause and that changes
in hormones and proinflammatory markers relate to mood symptoms, specifically measuring plasma levels of
FSH, estradiol, acyl-ghrelin, progesterone, liver-enriched antimicrobial peptide 2, cytokines and adipokines in
basal plasma. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that proinflammatory markers change with surgical menopause and
that changes in acyl-ghrelin and vagal activity (vagal reflex, heart rate variability) relate to proinflammatory
markers. Aim 3 (exploratory) will test the hypothesis that hormones relate to monocyte signaling changes with
surgical menopause and that this signaling relates to proinflammatory markers. Mediation models will test for
mechanistic effects across all aims."

Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting 2-3% of the population and nearly 200 million
individuals globally. While it is often benign, a subset of patients with MVP may develop arrhythmias, including
sudden cardiac death (SCD). Although the association between MVP and SCD was first reported decades ago,
the risk was initially believed to be small; contemporary observational studies suggest that SCD may be a more
common sequela in MVP, with an estimated yearly incidence between 0.4 and 1.9%.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recently convened a workshop composed of subject matter experts
and stakeholders to identify research needs and opportunities to develop recommendations for the identification
and treatment of individuals with mitral valve prolapse, including such individuals who may be at risk for sudden
cardiac arrest or sudden cardiac death.
Our current proposal is designed to align closely with the priorities identified in the recent NIHBI workshop.
Specifically, our proposal has three aims: 1) perform deep phenotyping of patients with MVP to understand
characteristics and mechanisms associated with ventricular arrhythmias; 2) Study a blood biomarkers panel
(including FDA-approved and novel high throughput proteomic markers) that could be used as a sensitive, costeffective
screening strategy to identify MVP patients with myocardial fibrosis who are at risk for SCD; 3) Build a
novel SCD risk prediction model in MVP inclusive of CMR evidence of myocardial fibrosis by assembling a large
observational multicenter MVP registry with over 2,000 contrast-enhanced CMRs and longitudinal follow-up for
arrhythmic events."

The remarkable effectiveness of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines heralds a transformative immunization
platform against viral infections. A key innovation—recognized with the 2023 Nobel Prize—is the replacement
of uridine (U) with N1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ) in their mRNA constructs. This substitution reduces side
effects and increases antigen production. However, applying m1Ψ-modified mRNA vaccines to the realm of
cancer immunotherapy introduces a host of new and complex challenges. These range from understanding the
implications of U-to-m1Ψ substitution on anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses to devising effective priming and
boosting strategies, creating more predictive animal models, and surmounting the immunosuppressive
elements within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, this proposal outlines a
research framework built around mechanistic studies with the goal of generating new mRNA vaccines for
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)—a cancer with urgent unmet therapeutic needs.
Specific Aim 1 seeks to engineer a new class of mRNA vaccines targeting clinically relevant tumor antigens,
mesothelin (MSLN), and mutant KRAS (KRASG12D). SubAim 1.1 consists of mechanistic studies to inform
strategies for optimizing mRNA-encoded antigen and adjuvant properties and devising effective priming and
boosting approaches to enhance immunogenicity and reduce reactogenicity. SubAim 1.2 uses stringent PDAC
models to evaluate whether the new vaccines significantly improve the efficacy of T cell transfer therapies.
Specific Aim 2 evaluates the new mRNA vaccines in humanized immune system mouse models. Due to
significant interspecies differences in innate immune responses to mRNA vaccines, it is vital to move beyond
traditional mouse models. SubAim 2.1 aims to understand the effects of these vaccines on human
conventional type 1 dendritic cells and subsequent CD8+ T cell activation. SubAim 2.2 focuses on validating
the vaccines' safety and efficacy in humanized mouse models engrafted with human PDAC tumors.
Specific Aim 3 assesses the potential for allele-specific KRAS inhibitors to reprogram the immunosuppressive
PDAC TME, thus enhancing mRNA vaccine efficacy. SubAim 3.1 will investigate whether the new mRNA
platform prevents tumor recurrence in PDAC mouse models treated with allele-specific KRAS inhibitors.
SubAim 3.2 seeks to elucidate how combining mRNA-based immunotherapies with KRAS-targeted therapies
impacts the immunogenicity of PDAC cells, the composition of the immune TME, and anti-tumor efficacy.
Deliverables range from developing and optimizing new mRNA vaccines to a systematic mechanistic
evaluation of these vaccines in both conventional and humanized mouse models, and finally, to investigating
synergies with clinical-stage mutant KRAS-targeted therapies. The anticipated impact consists of advancing
the understanding of how new mRNA-based immunotherapies enable priming and sustaining the cancer-
immunity cycle and developing effective combination therapies against PDAC for future clinical translation."

The focus of this renewal remains colorectal cancer (CRC), the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
During the last cycle of funding, seminal advances were made related to early and late events in colorectal
neoplasia, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and uncovering paradigm-shifting concepts applicable to other
solid tumors. In the next cycle, we will concentrate on microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, which accounts for 85%
of CRC and does not respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in marked contrast to microsatellite unstable
(MSI-H) CRC. As MSS tumors are derived from a stem/progenitor epithelial cell population, we propose studies
involving the identification of a novel marker for a quiescent stem cell population, Tob2, as well as determining
the nonredundant roles of Lrig1 and Lrig3 in colonic tumor formation as they are critical regulators of intestinal
homeostasis. In separate studies using a novel NSC-seq platform, we have identified Tob2 that is expressed
early in mouse embryogenesis and marks a population of quiescent stem cells that will be probed for its ability
to impact colonic tumor formation as well. Also, we have discovered a 4-gene immune-exclusion (IEX) score in
MSS CRC that impacts clinical outcome. Three of the genes encode secreted proteins (DDR1, TGFBi, DPEP1)
that may be responsible for IEX and are therapeutically tractable. A clinical trial has already started combining a
neutralizing antibody to DDR1 and ICB. A major area of investigation has been small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
and an amembranous nanoparticle, termed supermeres, which we recently discovered. Remarkably, DPEP1
and TGFBi are the two most abundant proteins in CRC sEVs and supermeres, respectively; DDR1 is also
enriched in supermeres. Of note, these proteins are markedly increased in the respective plasma-derived
fractions of CRC patients versus healthy controls so they may serve as CRC biomarkers. We propose
mechanistic studies to determine the function of these proteins, including that of a novel isoform of DPEP1 whose
overexpression results in tumor formation in mice. Our discovery of supermeres has opened the possibility for
new biomarkers and ways to target tumor progression through cell-cell communication, which we will explore
through understanding supermere biogenesis and determining supermere function in immunomodulation of the
CRC tumor microenvironment. In this renewal, we intend to continue to make paradigm-shifting discoveries that
impact the ways of thinking about cancer, its origins, how it progresses, as well as implementing practice-
changing strategies to diagnose and treat MSS CRC."

Cannabis use is on an upward trajectory due to recent decriminalization and legalization. This increased use is
associated with numerous health and behavioral effects, including risk for developing cannabis use disorder
(CUD). Despite the growing use of cannabis and cannabis-derived products as sleep aids due to their ability to
promote sleep, evidence suggests that chronic cannabis use paradoxically leads to disrupted sleep and circadian
rhythms. Moreover, sleep disturbances such as insomnia are a hallmark feature of cannabis withdrawal and
increase risk of relapse and continued use. However, very little is known about the molecular and cellular
mechanisms underlying the bidirectional relationship between circadian rhythms and cannabis use. The effects
of cannabinoids on sleep may be driven, in part, through their interaction with the core molecular clock, which
consists of a series of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that control circadian-dependent (near 24
hour) gene expression. Notably, the endocannabinoid and circadian systems are tightly linked, with
endocannabinoids showing diurnal rhythms in expression in the periphery and brain, including the nucleus
accumbens (NAc). Moreover, cannabinoids directly impact the molecular clock and influence peripheral and
behavioral rhythms. However, the effects of cannabinoids on molecular rhythms in the brain and differences
between cell types differentially implicated in cannabis use have not been investigated. Measures of molecular
rhythms in human postmortem brain are challenging since each brain represents a single circadian timepoint.
However, an innovative analysis uses “time of death” (TOD) to fit subjects on a 24-hr ‘clock’, making it possible
to reconstruct molecular rhythm patterns in the human brain. Using this approach, we and others have
demonstrated robust molecular rhythms of the human brain transcriptome, with altered rhythms in psychiatric
and substance use disorders. The central hypothesis of this R01 proposal is that there are bidirectional
relationships between molecular rhythms and cannabinoid use, with cannabinoids disrupting cell type-specific
molecular rhythms in the NAc, and these disruptions contributing to escalating cannabinoid use. To test this
hypothesis, we will use a rat model to determine how cannabinoid self-administration affects cell type-specific
molecular rhythms in the NAc, as well as EEG-based measures of sleep/wake rhythms and sleep architecture
(Aim 1). We will then determine whether cell type-specific molecular rhythm disruption in the NAc is sufficient to
cause changes in self-administration (Aim 2). Lastly, we will perform translational studies to determine how
molecular rhythms are altered in distinct cell types of the NAc using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-
seq) in subjects with CUD (Aim 3). Together, these studies will be the first to examine molecular rhythms in the
human brain of subjects with CUD and explore the mechanistic interactions of rhythm alterations and
cannabinoid use. A better understanding of these interactions will not only provide insights into the neurobiology
of cannabis use, but also the identification of novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for CUD."

Psychological distress is an important component of cancer care, and can adversely affect treatment compliance,
quality of life and survival. Data about psychological distress in Black breast cancer survivors are sparse. This
is an important gap given the racial disparities in breast cancer for Black women and the adverse impact of
psychological distress on breast cancer outcomes. The purpose of the proposed research, “An In-depth
Examination of Psychological Distress in Black Breast Cancer Survivors,” is to gain a detailed understanding of
the unique role of multilevel factors on the psychological distress experience of Black breast cancer survivors,
and how Black women cope with breast cancer related psychological distress. This is essential to identify
potentially modifiable factors for distress management interventions in Black breast cancer survivors. A highly
qualified multi-disciplinary team has been assembled to support my research and training goals. The predoctoral
(F99) research project is a mixed methods study guided by the model of cancer related worries, study aims are
to: 1a) leveraging an existing longitudinal cohort study compare longitudinal levels of psychological distress, and
associations of sociodemographic and clinical factors and psychological distress by race in Black and White
breast cancer survivors; 1b) leveraging an existing longitudinal cohort study evaluate the contribution of
healthcare related (patient provider communication), and psychosocial factors (medical mistrust) on
psychological distress among Black and White breast cancer survivors; 1c) Determine if healthcare related and
psychosocial factors identified in aim 1b mediate and/or moderate the association between race and
psychological distress; 1d) using primary qualitative focus group data describe the healthcare and psychosocial
factors that contribute to distress among Black and White survivors. The postdoctoral (K00) research project’s
goal is to understand Black breast cancer survivors’ strategies to cope with psychological distress. Utilizing
Strauss and Corbin’s grounded theory methodology and a community engaged approach, study aim is to 2)
describe Black breast cancer survivors’ strategies for coping with psychological distress using in-depth
interviews. The proposed research aligns with NCI’s key research area of cancer survivorship, which among
other issues prioritizes addressing psychological concerns in cancer survivors."
10993265,"Abstract:
Aging represents a prominent risk factor for infection-related mortality. This heightened susceptibility to
infection is closely associated to the attenuation of both strength and durability of humoral responses in elderly
humans and mice following vaccination. Extensive clinical and fundamental aging research point to a few
mechanisms attributing to immune dysfunction, yet antibody titers are reduced and tend to decay faster.
Plasma cells (PCs) are rare, radiation resistant, terminally differentiated B cells responsible for maintaining
long lasting serological memory. With aging, PCs accumulate, however it does not correlate to enhanced
protection. Thus, PCs may play a detrimental role during vaccine responses in the elderly. Within the bone
marrow (BM) niche, PCs demonstrate a ‘stop and go’ motility pattern, allowing them to freely navigate in the
BM and assemble into or disassemble from clusters. A subset of PCs known for their ability to survive for years
in humans and mice are recognized as long-lived PCs (LLPCs). Intravital imaging of mouse BM LLPCs reveals
that they are arrested in survival clusters, which we have found are not formed in APRIL-deficient mice, a
critical cytokine involved in PC longevity. With aging, human-derived BM morphonuclear cells express,
produce, and secrete reduced levels of APRIL. Moreover, the increase in TNFα and other pro-inflammatory
cytokines with aging, or inflamm-aging, may contribute to increased pressure for survival of newly generated
PCs but not LLPCs after vaccination. While PCs accumulate with age, preliminary data from our lab indicates
that LLPCs are enriched in the PC pool of elderly mice. Thus, my overall hypothesis is that, with aging, the
accumulation of LLPCs dysregulates humoral immunity through competition against nascent PCs. I
aim to test this hypothesis in numerous and robust ways. By using adult (3–5 month old) and elderly (20-24
month old) C57B6/J mice, unique genetic tools targeting PCs, 2-photon intravital imaging, spectral flow
cytometry, and high through-put sequencing, I will be able to enumerate the accumulation of BM LLPCs and
comprehensively demonstrate competition between pre-existing PCs and nascent PCs. Ultimately, this study
proposes a novel competition model and the first ever single cell-RNA sequencing library on aging PCs. The
outcomes of this study can lead to an improvement in current vaccinations for elderly individuals or tailored
vaccines for this demographic."

Individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an extremely high risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, they are not optimally prescribed evidence-based cardio-renal
preventive therapies that could considerably reduce such risk. These therapies, which include angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
agonists (GLP1) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), substantially lower CVD risk and the
risk of CKD progression. Thus, their optimal prescription could lead to marked reductions in the CVD burden of
patients with T2DM and CKD.
 In the mentored phase of the award, the proposed research will investigate the major factors
accounting for the under-prescription of cardio-renal preventive therapies among patients with T2DM and CKD.
To accomplish this, we will conduct mixed-methods research combining quantitative analyses with qualitative
explorations. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will leverage a dataset of over 1.5 million patients with T2DM in the
Veterans Affairs (VA) system to identify multi-level predictors of prescription of cardio-renal preventive
therapies. In Aim 2, we will conduct focus groups with patients and providers to qualitatively explore contextual
determinants of the under-prescription of cardio-renal preventive therapies.
 In the independent phase of the award (Aim 3), we will leverage findings form Aims 1 and 2 to
implement an educational intervention aimed at improving primary care providers’ knowledge and self-efficacy
regarding cardio-renal preventive therapies in one medical facility. The components of the educational
intervention are: 1) an educational toolkit consisting of an informational booklet, fact sheets/infographics, and
informational posters for use in clinics; 2) primary care provider champions who will serve as reference
providers regarding prescription of cardio-renal preventive therapies; and 3) interdisciplinary case-conferences
regarding appropriate prescription of cardio-renal therapies. We will evaluate the change of primary care
providers’ knowledge and self-efficacy before and after the intervention and compare changes in the rates of
prescription of cardio-renal preventive therapies with a “passive” control medical facility.
 The completion of the proposed research and training in implementation science and mixed-methods
research will be instrumental to establish Dr. Lamprea Montealegre’s independent research career at the
intersection of CVD epidemiology and implementation science. In particular, the new set of skills in
implementation science will allow Dr. Lamprea Montealegre to lead research and clinical programs on CVD
prevention through the systematic detection and treatment of CKD, and to become a national leader in
preventive cardio-renal care."

Supplement to Parent Grant Dysregulation of Cav1.2 by beta amyloid peptide
L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) are key regulators of gene transcription, neuronal excitability, and synaptic
functions. Cav1.2 is the prevalent LTCC in brain (Hell et al., 1993, JCB 123, 949-962). Chronically increased
Ca2+ influx via LTCCs has been implicated early on in senile symptoms and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (e.g.,
Science 272, 1017). We found that aged rats have significantly increased PKA-mediated phosphorylation of
Cav1.2 on Serine 1928 (Davare and Hell, 2003, PNAS 100, 16018-23), which increases Cav1.2 channel activity
(Qian, …, Hell, 2017, Sci Sig 10, eaaf9659). We also found that Cav1.2 forms a unique signaling complex with
the b2 adrenergic receptor (b2 AR) (e.g., Davare et al., 2001, Science 293, 98), making Cav1.2 a prime target for
b2 AR signaling. Oligomeric b amyloid peptide 1-42 (Abo) stimulates the b2 AR. Our supportive evidence indicates
that Abo increase Cav1.2 activity via the b2 AR and the ensuing S1928 phosphorylation. Aim 1 is to test whether
Cav1.2 dysregulation by Abo via Cav1.2-associated b2 AR occurs in dendrites and spines (Ca2+ imaging) and
whether blocking this signaling alleviates Abo neurotoxicity. Aim 2 is to test whether Abo - b2 AR - S1928
signaling stimulates surface insertion of Ca2+ permeable (CP) AMPARs (GluA1 homomers) and blocking CP-
AMPARs alleviates Abo neurotoxicity. Aim 3 will test the role of Abo - b2 AR - S1928 signaling in augmentation
of long-term depression (LTD) by Abo, and in long-term potentiation, which is impaired by Abo. We recently
proved that S1928 phosphorylation downstream of endogenous
During our work on LTD we realized that in adult mice it can only readily be induced during evening and night
hours, the active phase of mice. We then found that S1928 phosphorylation downstream of endogenous
norepinephrine (NE) signaling is strictly required for LTD. For the Supplement we propose to test the emerging
hypothesis that LTD in adult mice has a circadian rhythm that is driven by the established increase NE during
active (night) phase and acts via b2 AR – S1928 signaling. The candidate Adejia Boutté will be central to execute
the electrophysiology."
10995732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Glaucoma affects about three million Americans and is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Patients
suffer from progressive optic neuropathy, for which intraocular pressure (IOP) induced mechanical insults at the
optic nerve head (ONH) play a central role. Current treatments all aim to lower IOP. While these treatments are
beneficial, many patients continue to lose vision with persistent optic nerve damage. There is a great need to
identify other modifiable risk factors, based on which novel treatments may be developed to combat this public
health problem. Biomechanically, the level of IOP-induced mechanical insults (i.e., stresses and strains) at the
ONH are not determined by IOP alone. Computational studies have shown that peripapillary sclera (PPS)
modulus and thickness are among the most influential factors. Interestingly, PPS biomechanical changes are
implicated in older age, African American race, and high myopia, which have increased glaucoma risk. However,
there is a knowledge gap in understanding the biomechanical interplay between ONH and PPS. For example,
what PPS biomechanical properties are optimal and how PPS can be modified to mitigate IOP-induced
mechanical insults at ONH remain poorly understood. We propose to use a high-resolution ultrasound
elastography technique to resolve the complex mechanical responses of the ONH and PPS through full tissue
thickness, and to begin to fill the knowledge gap. Using this technique, we will quantify ONH and PPS
deformation in normal human donor eyes, those with PPS remodeling, and those with experimental modification
of PPS properties. We will also further develop this technique for in vivo biomechanical imaging of the ONH and
PPS in an animal model. Specifically, we propose the following aims: 1) test the prediction that ONH deformation
is correlated with PPS deformation and different in older age and African American race, 2) test the prediction
that ONH deformation is different in eyes with PPS remodeling, 3) test the prediction that ONH deformation is
altered after biochemical stiffening or softening of the PPS, and 4) test the feasibility of in vivo ONH and PPS
ultrasound elastography in a pig model. Successful completion of the proposed studies will establish a clear
understanding of the biomechanical interplay between ONH and PPS, a key contributor to an individual eye’s
mechanical susceptibility to IOP. Combined with the development of an in vivo biomechanical imaging technique,
this knowledge will lay a foundation for novel diagnostic and treatment strategies to reduce glaucoma vision loss."
10993820,"Defining Sexual Dimorphism in the Skin
 The skin executes many functions differently based on biological sex. Nevertheless, the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that give rise to these functional differences are poorly understood. Tissue-level sexual
dimorphism may be rooted in the behaviors of somatic stem cells, such as hair follicle stem cells, which maintain
tissues and can proliferate differently based on sex. This proposal will determine how biological sex, an
organismal-level characteristic, affects stem cell behavior. I will study sex differences in hair follicle renewal
during periods of both low and high sex hormones. Our preliminary data show that HFSCs, which regenerate
the hair follicle in a highly synchronized manner, exhibit different proliferative behaviors in male and female mice.
Before puberty, HFSCs begin to proliferate in males before females. This sexually dimorphic HFSC behavior
may be due to differences in sex hormones, sex chromosomes, or both. Conversely, after puberty, when sex
hormone production increases, HFSCs in females proliferate first. Distinct factors, therefore, may influence
HFSC sexual dimorphism at different stages of life. Before puberty, elimination of sex hormones by gonad
removal does not alter hair follicle renewal, suggesting circulating sex hormones do not establish sex differences
at this stage. In adulthood, we found that sex hormone depletion by gonad removal leads to dramatically
accelerated hair growth and eliminates sex differences. This accelerated hair follicle renewal is prevented in
gonadectomized males by treatment with the androgen 5𝛼-dihydrotestosterone. These data suggest that
androgens, a major type of sex hormone, can maintain HFSC quiescence after puberty. Cell-type specific
knockouts of the androgen receptor in HFSCs and the microenvironment, or niche, reveal that androgens
specifically maintain HFSC quiescence via the niche. My central hypothesis is prior to puberty, sex chromosomes
primarily govern HFSC sexual dimorphism. The rise of sex hormones in puberty masks these differences, and
androgens contribute to sex differences by altering the release of HFSC-modulating factors from the niche. I will
interrogate the determinants of HFSC sexual dimorphism using surgical and genetic mouse models, as well as
our expertise in constructing viral tools. In Aim 1, I will identify the contributions of sex chromosomes and sex
hormones to sexual dimorphism in juvenile HFSC behavior and upon puberty. Aim 2 will reveal the gene products
responsible for androgen-dependent HFSC quiescence using viral tools. Together, these data will identify the
foundations of sex differences in HFSCs. My findings may reveal novel avenues for development of treatments
for sexually dimorphic conditions."
10995127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the site of action potential initiation, the axon initial segment (AIS) contains high densities of voltage-gated
sodium (Nav) and potassium (Kv) channels that generate and shape the action potential. Kv1 channels are a
prominent type of ion channel at the AIS that modulate action potential waveform. Despite their functional
importance, the mechanisms responsible for the localization of these channels at the AIS are poorly understood.
In contrast, the recruitment of other ion channels to the AIS is well established and depends on interaction with
the AIS scaffold protein, AnkyrinG (AnkG). Nav1 and Kv7 channels directly interact with AnkG through a
conserved binding motif that Kv1 channels lack. However, unlike Nav1 and Kv7 channels, Kv1 channels contain
PDZ binding motifs, which permit interactions with PDZ domain containing proteins. Kv1 channels have been
shown to interact with the PDZ domain-containing scaffold protein PSD93 that is highly enriched at the AIS.
Although in vitro knockdown studies found that PSD93 is required for Kv1 channel clustering at the AIS,
subsequent in vivo knockout studies demonstrated that PSD93 is dispensable, suggesting that other
mechanisms can cluster Kv1 channels at the AIS. Previous work also suggests that AnkG is required for AIS Kv1
channel clustering, but the link between AnkG and Kv1 channels is unknown and may be indirect. Thus, the
mechanisms underlying Kv1 channel localization at the AIS are unclear. Our lab recently identified a new AIS
scaffold protein, SCRIB, that directly binds AnkG. SCRIB contains multiple PDZ domains and may constitute a
novel mechanism for clustering Kv1 channels at the AIS. However, the function of SCRIB at the AIS has not
been investigated. The objective of this proposal is to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for clustering
Kv1 channels at the AIS. Aim 1 will use AAV- and CRISPR-based knockouts, conditional knockout mouse
models, and immunostaining to determine if SCRIB, PSD93, and AnkG are necessary for AIS Kv1 channel
clustering in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2 will use co-immunoprecipitations and surface clustering assays in
heterologous cells to determine the molecular interactions between Kv1 channels and the AIS scaffold proteins
SCRIB, PSD93, and AnkG. The proposed experiments will establish a model for how Kv1 channels are localized
at the AIS. The Rasband lab has extensive experience elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying AIS
assembly. Thus, the proposed experiments are designed to take advantage of this expertise and the many tools
and reagents available in the Rasband lab. This research project will also provide a robust training experience
for my development as a molecular neurobiologist. Through the completion of the proposed aims, I will advance
the research skills, critical thinking skills, scientific communication skills, and mentorship skills that I will need for
my future career as an independent investigator."

Environmental toxicants are understudied modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Toxic
metals, and some essential trace elements, are well-known neurotoxicants and have been linked to cognitive
decline. Evaluating the joint actions of environmental exposures may elucidate shared physiologic pathways
and may inform policy. Populations with documented health disparities may be especially vulnerable to such
pathways due to higher cumulative exposure to environmental hazards and social stressors like poverty,
discrimination, or unsafe neighborhoods. Growing evidence suggests that novel epigenetic markers of DNA
methylation age predict a host of aging-related outcomes. Few studies have examined whether environmental
toxicants, individually or as a mixture, predict DNA methylation age acceleration. To address these gaps, the
Candidate proposes new aims in the Baltimore Memory Study, a study of cognitive and cardiovascular aging in
50- to 70-year-old residents of Baltimore, with diversity in race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. The overall
objective of this proposal is to determine whether co-exposures to environmental toxicants and contextual
(neighborhood) stressors are linked to cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment, novel epigenetic
biomarkers. In the K99 phase, Dr. Moon will take advantage of existing bone lead biomarkers and chronic
stress measures to estimate whether the causal association of lead on longitudinal cognitive function (Aim 1)
or mild cognitive impairment (Aim 2) is modified by either a theory-based scale of neighborhood psychosocial
hazards or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis dysfunction, measured by saliva cortisol. To complete these
aims and prepare for independence, Dr. Moon will train in four methodologic areas: cognitive aging
epidemiology, mixture and causal inference models, co-exposures to social stressors, and epigenetics through
formal coursework and mentoring. These training goals will be completed under the guidance of a strong
mentoring and advisory team (Drs. Schwartz, Buckley, Gross, Dean, and Ladd-Acosta). This Pathway in
Independence Award is critical to achieving Dr. Moon's long-term goal of becoming an independent
investigator with expertise on the environmental determinants of aging-related disease, particularly cognitive
aging outcomes, and evaluating how co-occurring social stressors contribute to health disparities. In the R00
phase, Dr. Moon will take advantage of stored biospecimens, measuring toxic and essential metals in urine
and genome-scale DNA methylation in blood. Using this new data, she will determine the independent joint
and effects of a mixture of metals on cognitive aging (cognitive function and mild cognitive impairment) (Aim 3)
and on DNA methylation age acceleration (Aim 4). The proposed training and aims will provide further
evidence that social and environmental factors must be addressed together to eliminate disparities in aging
and preliminary data to support an R01 investigating the role of a mixture of metals and chronic stressors on
DNA methylation-based biomarkers in aging."

Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias are a growing public health concern, currently affecting nearly 8
million older adults and 16 million informal caregivers in the U.S. Informal caregiving—unpaid care by family
members or friends—for persons living with dementia (PLWD) is uniquely demanding, with significant financial
and emotional impacts. While the population continues to age and the number of PLWD requiring assistance
grows, the pool of potential informal caregivers is also contracting, creating intense pressure to maintain the
health and wellbeing of both caregivers and the PLWD for whom they provide care. There is an urgent need to
understand how informal caregiving impacts both PLWD and caregiver health care use, and how serious
illness for a PLWD or caregiver impacts the health care use of the other member of the dyad, to inform future
caregiver interventions and policy. The goal of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to prepare Dr.
Lianlian Lei for a career as a successful independent health services investigator focused on disentangling the
links between informal caregiving and how PLWD and their caregivers engage and interact with the health care
system. Dr. Lei’s background and training in health services research, policy, and economics provide her with
a solid foundation for the proposed work, but in order to transition to independence she requires additional
skills and experience that will be gained through a coordinated program of research, mentorship, and didactics
during the K99 phase of the award period. This will include training and experiences in: (1) clinical exposure to
caregivers of PLWD; (2) skills to analyze complex, nationally representative survey data; (3) advanced
methods of causal inference using econometric models; and (4) career skills needed to transition to
independence, including research-related leadership and grantsmanship. Building on her previous research
and training examining health care use and costs for PLWD, Dr. Lei’s research will use data from nationally
representative surveys, including the National Health and Aging Trends Study and the Health and Retirement
Study, both linked with Medicare claims data to identify the impact of informal caregiving on health care use of
both PLWD (Aim 1.1) and caregivers (Aim 1.2), comparing instrumental variable (e.g., number of daughters,
market supply of formal care) models and panel data fixed effects models. Aim 2 will further apply the panel
data fixed effects models in HRS-linked Medicare claims to examine the impact of caregiver serious illness on
PLWD health care use, while Aim 3 will examine the impact of PLWD serious illness on caregiver health care
use. Upon successful completion of the study, findings will yield key knowledge of informal caregiving and
serious illness to enable better identification of high-risk PLWD and caregivers, and will inform future targeted
interventions to promote the health and wellbeing of both PLWD and caregivers. These results will provide the
basis for a future R01 grant application targeting high-risk PLWD and caregivers following serious illness."

fundamental information-processing units of the brain. Each neuron receives thousands of inputs from other
neurons at synapses and converts particular patterns of inputs into output (action potentials). Understanding the
operations that neurons can perform will help reveal the algorithms that the brain utilizes to produce behavior. A
rich body of theoretical work has put forward several models of neural computation of varying complexity. Some
propose that spatially clustered inputs are more effective at driving output whereas other models suggest that
diffuse input is better. It is still unclear which models, if any, accurately describe single neuron computation in
vivo and during behavior. The study of single neuron computation requires the simultaneous measurement of
many inputs to, and the output from, a neuron in vivo, which has not yet been possible. In my research, I will
leverage novel imaging technologies to overcome current limitations and measure the input and output signals
of individual cortical neurons. I hypothesize that action potential generation in vivo is more likely after a neuron
receives clustered synaptic input. I will address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Characterize the spatiotemporal relationships between synaptic input patterns and action potentials.
Aim 2: Investigate how inputs change when the brain drives activity in a specific neuron.
Aim 3: Determine whether hierarchical nonlinearities are needed to model a neuron’s computation.
This project will result in new models of the neuron that better represent the range of computations performed in
vivo. Given that neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and bipolar
disorder, have been hypothesized to affect proteins that dictate a neuron’s computational properties, a
comprehensive understanding of neural computation would allow for mechanistic explanations of how such
diseases affect patients’ cognitive capabilities."
10984600,"Project Summary/Abstract
Human beings have a remarkable capacity for exerting cognitive control to achieve their goals, even though
performing such tasks can be stressful (e.g., getting into college, landing a job or promotion). Although the ability
to exert cognitive control to achieve goals in the face of ongoing stress is highly significant for determining one’s
productivity, health, and well-being, the neurocomputational mechanisms by which cognitive control is evaluated
are poorly understood. Recent research suggests that people consider the controllability of a sustained stressor
in deciding how to strategically allocate mental effort, yet how people perform this strategic adjustment is unclear.
Whereas substantial research has examined how acute stress (e.g., cold pressor) influences mental effort, less
is known about how the contingencies of sustained stress (e.g., ongoing controllable vs. uncontrollable shocks)
drive different strategies for mental effort allocation (e.g., attentional focus or response caution). This proposal
will investigate the serotonergic influence on neural and computational processes that underlie how individuals
exert mental effort in the face of sustained and uncontrollable stressors (shock). I will leverage our novel Stressor
Controllability and Cognitive Control (SCCC) model, psychopharmacology, and pharmaco-fMRI to identify these
neurocomputational mechanisms and test whether serotonin interacts with the aversiveness and controllability
of ongoing stressors to bias distinct effort strategies for control allocation. Aim 1 (K99) will use the SCCC model
to generate predictions for how sustained stressors guide different effort strategies (e.g., focus vs. caution) and
identify separate sub-processes that reflect the (1) aversiveness and (2) controllability of sustained stressors
during these decisions. Aim 2 (K99) will use a pharmacological probe (escitalopram) to test if controllability is a
key factor determining when and how SSRIs are effective in modulating strategic goal-directed adjustments in
mental effort allocation. Aim 3 (R00) will use pharmaco-fMRI to investigate to what extent distinct brain networks
(e.g., dorsal vs. ventral medial prefrontal cortex) underlie stressor controllability and cognitive control, and
localize serotonin influences in neural pathways. These Specific Aims support the applicant’s training goals
(computational modeling of stress/affect, psychopharmacology). The training plan includes various workshops,
courses, and guided readings to help the applicant gain the expertise to conduct trailblazing research on stress
and cognitive control as an independent investigator. The intellectual environment at Brown is rich and highly
interdisciplinary. The applicant will benefit from frequent interactions with world-renowned faculty with substantial
expertise in topics related to the proposed research (e.g., computational modeling of stress, affect, and cognitive
control). Understanding the computations, networks, and neurotransmitter systems through which sustained
stressors guide mental effort will inform how disrupted neural networks give rise to motivational impairments
(e.g., apathy, amotivation). Clarifying the role of serotonin in stressor controllability and mental effort is significant
and can help understand why and when people are vulnerable vs. resilient to stressors in psychiatric disorders."

The Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) seeks to improve our understanding of the important
transitions during tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis, and to provide a detailed,
multi-dimensional map of these states. Since 2018, our multi-institutional group has managed
the HTAN Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and HTAN data are now available via multiple
mechanisms, including the HTAN Data Portal, the Synapse platform, and the NCI Cancer
Research Data Commons (CRDC). The aim of this application is to continue the important work
of the DCC by continuing to release HTAN data to the wider scientific community and further
developing visualization, annotation, and analysis tools that meet the needs of HTAN and the
diverse cancer research community. Our vision for the HTAN DCC is a dynamic, modular and
adaptive center that will: 1) continue to evolve the HTAN data standards, and continue to build
and maintain the core HTAN data platform for storage, analysis, and dissemination; 2) continue
to provide logistical support for network coordination and communication; and 3) expand our
education and outreach activities to the wider scientific community, further enabling the re-use of
HTAN data."
10981698,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hippocampus (HPC) structure and its connectivity with frontoparietal regions continue to develop through
adolescence, a developmental period associated with substantial gains in memory and reasoning. While such
structural changes are well documented, we know less about the functions that HPC and frontoparietal
development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms through which individuals
learn and reason about the world at different ages. From very early in life, children can learn simple
associations that they directly experience. However, with age, our memories become more complex, reflecting
not only directly observed information, but also knowledge derived across multiple episodes. Such derived
knowledge might represent commonalities among experiences while simultaneously exaggerating important
differences between them, thus forming hierarchical knowledge structures that can support inference decisions
about event relationships, while also preserving detailed memory for when and where those relationships vary
by context. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that representational capacity within
HPC and frontoparietal cortex undergoes qualitative changes during adolescence. We will use a serial cohort
design to collect data from adolescents (13-18 years) at three timepoints, each 1.5 years apart, as well as data
from adults (19-25 years) at a single timepoint. This design will allow us to test longitudinal predictions about
how changes in neural representation within individual adolescents, over time, predict corresponding changes
in memory and inference behaviors, as well as cross-sectional predictions about how HPC and frontoparietal
cortex representation differs between adolescents and adults. We will use high-resolution functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI), representational fMRI analyses, and computational modeling, to test three Aims.
Aim 1 will test the prediction that HPC and ventromedial prefrontal (vmPFC) representations will transition from
coding simple, individual associations to extracting hierarchical knowledge about the relationships among
experiences. Aim 2 will test the prediction that lateral parietal cortex (LPC)-mediated memory reactivation
during new learning and inference will have different consequences for HPC—vmPFC representation and
inference behavior at distinct points in adolescence. Aim 3 will test the prediction that emerging vmPFC control
will influence what memories are available in LPC during learning and inference, as well as directly mediate the
impact reactivated memories have on the trajectory of HPC representation during adolescence. The results
from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially
advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—frontoparietal memory system in
typically developing adolescents. In doing so, the findings may have important implications for our eventual
understanding of how the onset of mental health disorders (e.g., affective disorders and schizophrenia) during
adolescence impact neural representation as well as memory and reasoning ability."
10981700,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of brain cancer and ~90% of GBM patients die
within 24 months after diagnosis.1 Treatment options for GBM include surgery and chemoradiation however,
recurrence is common, and the disease is universally fatal.2,3 Over the past 20 years, induced neural stem cells
(iNSCs) have been investigated as a novel modality for the treatment of brain cancer. The ability of iNSCs to
home to tumors and kill cancer cells are makes them attractive as a new approach for the treatment of GBM.
Other potential challenges include the need for repeated invasive surgery for redosing or to remove the
biomaterial if it is not biodegradable in nature. To address these limitations, we propose to develop a combination
therapy that harnesses long-acting delivery (>90 days) of NSCs using a novel injectable and biodegradable
biomaterial and a non-invasive and efficient redosing of NSCs across the blood brain barrier (BBB) using state-
of-the-art focused ultrasound (FUS) technology for enhanced treatment of GBM. The Scientific Premise of these
studies is that A) an injectable biodegradable hydrogel scaffold can be developed that: 1) implements a
tunable/scalable manufacturing process, 2) can accommodate high concentrations of NSCs (≥106 cells/mL) with
initial targeted sustained delivery of ≥3 months, and 3) is biodegradable and does not require surgical removal
post administration; B) a non-invasive systemic redosing regimen of NSCs to recurring GBM using FUS to
delivery NSCs across the BBB. Our central hypothesis is that sustained local delivery of NSCs ( 3 months)
alone or in combination with non-invasive redosing using FUS will improve access to residual or recurring tumor
cells and survival outcomes in preclinical models. This cutting-edge combined approach will be utilized to
evaluate the scientific premise of our proposal in preclinical mouse models to investigate the safety and efficacy
of a unique and highly innovative combinatorial technology and treatment approach to improve treatment of
GBM."
10981699,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Problematic cannabis use rates have increased in ’emerging adulthood’ (age 18-25), an age also characterized
by high rates of insomnia and the developmental peak in a tendency toward eveningness (preference for later
sleep timing). Cannabis-sleep relationships are increasingly recognized as pertinent for understanding risk for
cannabis misuse, particularly given the high prevalence of cannabis use as a sleep aid. Insomnia and an
evening chronotype are risk factors for cannabis use, and cannabis use affects sleep, but the mechanisms
underlying these cannabis-sleep relationships are poorly understood. Experimental rodent studies implicate
cannabis effects on homeostatic sleep drive (increased) and circadian photosensitivity (reduced), although
some effects are evident only in males. However, these mechanisms have not been sufficiently investigated in
humans, with scant research using the sleep EEG measures necessary to assess homeostatic sleep drive in
relation to cannabis use, and no published studies examining cannabis effects on circadian photosensitivity. In
response to RFA-DA-24-021, we propose to study the effects of cannabis use and discontinuation on sleep
and circadian characteristics, including sleep physiology and circadian photosensitivity, in 60 emerging adults
(18-25 y/o; 50% female) reporting regular cannabis use. We will examine participants throughout a 1-week
Baseline period of regular cannabis use followed by a 4-week Cannabis Discontinuation reinforced by a
contingency management protocol. Homeostatic sleep drive will be assessed at home using sleep EEG
headbands during Baseline (on both nights of cannabis use and non-use), as well as during early and
extended abstinence during the Discontinuation. Circadian photosensitivity and circadian phase will be
assessed in the laboratory at Baseline and after Discontinuation. A Control group of 30 age- and sex-matched
healthy-sleeping emerging adults without current cannabis use will undergo all Baseline procedures. Aim 1 will
examine the effects of cannabis use and discontinuation on the homeostatic sleep drive. Aim 2 will examine
the effects of cannabis use and discontinuation on circadian photosensitivity and phase. An exploratory aim will
examine sex differences in cannabis effects on sleep, circadian rhythms, and light responsivity."
10981387,"Project Summary
Most cancers develop from premalignant lesions that progress to malignancy in response to further mutations
or epigenetic changes. A better understanding of malignant progression may enable approaches to suppress
tumorigenesis, especially in individuals with specific cancer predispositions. This project aims to define
mechanisms through which premalignant lesions form and progress to malignancy in the childhood retinal
cancer, retinoblastoma. In this cancer, biallelic loss of RB1 is thought to enable the aberrant proliferation of early
maturing cone precursors (emCPs), which then form largely quiescent premalignant lesions in utero, followed
by emergence of retinoblastoma foci in the perinatal and postnatal periods. The earliest retinoblastomas appear
to lack clonal mutations beyond RB1, implying that entrance into and escape from premalignancy is enabled by
epigenetic changes. In preliminary studies, we developed stem cell-derived retinal organoid models that display
initial emCP proliferation, a largely quiescent premalignant stage, and emergence of retinoblastoma-like foci at
tissue ages similar to those of retinoblastomas in patients. Accordingly, the models provide an opportunity to
define mechanisms underlying the production and progression of premalignant retinoblastoma in an
experimentally tractable setting. Although numerous aspects may be considered, the project focuses on: a) the
emCPs’ proliferation dynamics and mitotic behavior at each tumorigenesis stage, along with gene expression
changes that overcome initially highly impaired mitoses to enable production of premalignant lesions; b) gene
expression changes that mediate exit from the cell cycle into a series of premalignant cell states; c) gene
expression and underlying epigenetic changes that mediate transitions between premalignant states and the
emergence of retinoblastoma-like foci, and finally d) characterization of the retinal organoid-derived
retinoblastoma-like foci, including definitive tests of their emCP origin, their malignant potential, and their
similarity to retinoblastomas in patients. Together, the studies aim to provide sufficient knowledge of malignant
progression to enable approaches to prevent this process in children with highly penetrant retinoblastoma
predisposition."
10981453,"Epidemiology and population genetics suggest that Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and related synucleinopathies, results from a complex interaction between genetic risk, aging, and environmental factors. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous sequence variants associated with the risk to develop neurodegenerative diseases, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding how specific risk variants functionally contribute to the disease’s pathology remains elusive.
Genome-scale epigenetic studies find the enrichment of GWAS variants in gene regulatory elements (GREs), suggesting that non-coding risk variants can affect disease pathogenesis by altering in the transcription of disease genes. To identify causal PD-GWAS variants within GREs, we integrated GWAS data with epigenetic information. Employing a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based platform in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to dissect the function GREs, we identified a GWAS-nominated enhancer that cis-regulates the expression of GPMNB.
GPNMB, preferentially expressed in microglia in the CNS, is upregulation in many neurodegenerative disorders including PD, Alzheimer’s diseases (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). Our pilot studies using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gain- and loss-of-function analysis in hPSC-derived microglia suggest a critical role of GPNMB in coordinating the neurodegeneration-associated neuroinflammatory response. We therefore hypothesize that cis- acting effects of GWAS risk variants lead to increased GPMNB expression in microglia, which enhances an inflammatory response that actively contributes to the neuronal damage in PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies.
The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of GPNMB in the pathogenesis of PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies. Specifically, we will combine GWAS information and cell-type specific epigenetic data with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to identify the causal GWAS-risk variant and molecularly define the regulation of GPNMB. Furthermore, employing molecular and cell biological tools, we will perform gain- and loss-of-function analysis to determine GPNMB’s role in coordinating neuroinflammation and its contribution to the neurodegeneration associated with -synuclein pathology. Finally, we will confirm the relevance of our in vitro findings in a more disease-relevant context by utilizing human-mouse microglia brain chimeras and primary brain tissue samples obtained from patients diagnosed with PD, LBD, and related synucleinopathies.
Our findings will provide critical insights on the role of GPNMB as common feature in the pathogenesis of PD, LBD and related synucleinopathies. Furthermore, this work will establish an experimental platform for advancing from genetic association to causal biology. The understanding of how genetic factors affecting non-neuronal cells contribute to neurodegenerative diseases is pivotal, as it offers a potential avenue for targeting these non- cell autonomous mechanisms and cell types as therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases including PD, AD, and ADRD."

Advances in population-scale genetic data linked to the electronic health record (EHR), along with the rise of
learning health systems (LHS) to enable the rapid translation of new knowledge to clinical care, have brought
us to the threshold of revolutionizing healthcare by using genomic medicine to predict and prevent diseases. To
cross this threshold, there is a need for a robust infrastructure to support the integration of existing genome
science advances into clinical care, and to evaluate outcomes of that integration. We propose here the
Vanderbilt Genomic Learning Health System as a Clinical Site in the genomic LHS (gLHS) Network. Work in
our clinical site will be implemented in diverse settings and in underserved populations with stakeholder
partners at Vanderbilt and the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics. Our team brings expertise in delivery of
care, basic and clinical genome science, and implementation science, and is part of an institutional
environment with recognized capabilities in integrating genomic data into the EHR, in genomic medicine, and
in clinical informatics, and includes a robust and productive LHS. The Network’s initial activity will be to select
specific projects and implementation strategies for the group. We outline three potential high-value projects
each of which builds on our team and institutional accomplishment: (1) using advanced EHR-based
phenotyping to increase identification of monogenic disorders, (2) using family health history to identify patients
at high disease risk due to actionable hereditary disease-causing mutations, and (3) personalizing genomic-
based laboratory reference ranges to avoid needless testing and increase equity in clinical medicine. We are
well-positioned to contribute to other Network-chosen projects, given our comprehensive clinical environment
and expertise in multiple domains of genomic medicine that are in advanced stages of institutional
implementation; these include pharmacogenomics, cancer genomics, and sequencing in the setting of critical
illness and in disease-specific genetics clinics. In our Aim 1, we will share our resources and expertise with the
Network to develop a data-driven framework for selecting proposed gLHS interventions and strategies. Aim 2
will incorporate the selected interventions into clinical practice, using a multi-component implementation
strategy with stakeholder engagement. Aim 3 will evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of each gLHS
intervention within our health system and across the Network, followed by refinement and re-implementation.
By identifying, implementing, and critically evaluating high value interventions across multiple and diverse
practice settings, the gLHS network represents a crucial next step in the maturation of the discipline of
Genomic Medicine."

10985137,"ABSTRACT FOR THE OVERALL U2C/TL1 APPLICATION
Kidney, urologic and hematologic (KUH) diseases are significant public health issues affecting the U.S.
population. Yet, the KUH scientific workforce is declining, stifling discovery and clinical innovation. We propose
to revitalize KUH research training by creating an innovative training program in Seattle and the greater
Northwest region of the U.S: Northwest COmprehensive Research Training in Kidney, Urologic and
Hematologic Sciences (NCOR-KUH) Program. The VISION of the Program is to train the next generation of
KUH scientists who will drive scientific innovation to improve the lives of patients with KUH diseases. To realize
this vision, the MISSION of the Program is to create an integrated KUH scientific environment to furnish
trainees with world-class hands-on research training, mentorship, education, and networking to foster their
personal and professional development, through the implementation of four complementary Cores
(Administrative TL1, Professional Development and Network Cores).
The NCOR-KUH Program will provide the ideal environment to accomplish this vison and mission. The
Program will be led by the University of Washington (UW), the only medical education system for a 5-state
region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho [WWAMI]) which comprises 27% of the U.S. land
mass. UW will partner with four affiliated, yet independently governed, institutions (Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Center, Seattle Children’s Hospital, Puget Sound VA and Bloodworks Northwest) to form the NCOR-KUH
Program. Each partnering institution conducts internationally recognized research; however shares faculty,
education, and research with the UW, which will facilitate implementation of an integrated training program.
Collectively, all five participating institutions have a culture of high-impact biomedical research and training,
evidenced by NIH funding (UW ranked #2 in the U.S), >$2 billion annual research dollars, more than 300 NIH
K, T and F-grant training programs, and a NIH Clinical and Translational Science Awards Program (CTSA).
The NCOR-KUH Program will leverage, integrate and expand existing strengths of KUH research and
training across Seattle, which include: one existing NIDDK T32 (adult nephrology), two previous NIDDK T32s
(urology and pediatric nephrology), an existing NHLBI T32 (hematology), non-NIDDK R25s, a 5-state WWAMI
CTSA and numerous KUH research institutes. The Program will unite 61 mentors from 5 institutions, 4
schools, 11 Departments, and 7 Divisions to train 12 pre and postdoctoral trainees in KUH science. The
leaders of the NCOR-KUH Program are a diverse team of scientists and physicians (52% women and 24%
from underrepresented backgrounds) with proven success in KUH research, research training, mentorship,
and education. As a sign of commitment, stakeholders have committed >$2.8 million in addition to NIH funds
to ensure success of the Program. We are confident that the NCOR-KUH Program will create a vibrant and
integrated ecosystem to inspire the next generation of KUH scientists."
10985143,"The uncontrolled growth of breast cancer cells in vital organs is attributable to nearly all the ~40,000 deaths that
happen each year in the United States. The long-term goal of this project is to identify new therapeutic strategies
to overcome chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The objective of this proposal
is to identify biological pathways that can be targeted in addition to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
to promote apoptosis of disseminated cancer cells. The central hypothesis is that EGFR inhibition leads to
activation of cellular stress responses that can be targeted with pro-apoptotic agents. The goal at the completion
of this project is for the results to immediately translate to the clinical setting and provide options for current
patients with metastatic disease. The proposed work will also develop a unique dataset that can be used for
further research towards identifying and developing targeted inhibitors that bypass carboplatin-resistance. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Delineate targetable pathways that are
synergistic with Afatinib for cytotoxicity of carboplatin-resistant TNBCs; 2) Determine the efficacy of Afatinib-
synergsitic combinations in multiple diverse in vivo models of TNBC. These aims will be pursued using an
innovative set of patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) which consist of isogenic pairs that are carboplatin-
sensitive or those that have been generated to be carboplatin-resistant. This research proposal is
significant because it will identify new therapeutic targets that can be used to treat patients with advanced
disease, and then compare the effectiveness of various targeted combinations on surgically unresectable
metastases. The expected outcome of these efforts is that we will identify subsets of TNBC PDXs that will
favorably respond to Afatinib-based combination therapies, and subsequently that we will identify genomic and/
or proteomic predictors of anti-EGFR response that will make a positive impact on disease management by
identifying patients that may benefit from this treatment approach."
10993883,"Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Hyperinsulinemia is commonly seen among pregnant women with prediabetes, obesity, and gestational
diabetes, and their offspring has a greater risk for developing T2D. Yet, no current study addresses the
long-term/longitudinal metabolic outcomes of the offspring when the mother is hyperinsulinemic.
Furthermore, the mechanistic link between maternal hyperinsulinemia and the programming of
metabolic disease in the offspring remains largely unknown. The dogma is that insulin does not cross
the placenta into the fetus to regulate fetal growth. However, maternal insulin can act as a growth factor
and an anabolic hormone binding to the placental insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor 1
receptor (IGF1R) to drive critical placental function, including nutrient flux to the fetus. Thus, maternal
insulin can change placental function by altering nutrient availability to fetal metabolic tissues causing
permanent changes that predispose the offspring to T2D in adulthood. Indeed, we have compelling
preliminary data showing increased body weight and glucose intolerance in the offspring of
hyperinsulinemic dams. We identified that placental-specific IR deletion has a beneficial effect in
improving glucose tolerance in the offspring of hyperinsulinemic dams. These observations provide a
strong premise that the placenta integrates maternal hyperinsulinemia signals with placental function
(i.e., nutrient flux and placental inflammation) to the growing fetus, thereby programming the metabolic
health of the offspring. In this supplemental award, we will test the main hypothesis that the increased
body weight and glucose intolerance programming in the offspring by maternal hyperinsulinemia is
caused in part by increased placental inflammation. To test that maternal hyperinsulinemia programs
metabolic dysfunction in offspring by accelerating the proinflammatory phase of placental development
during gestation, we will perform the following two specific aims: Aim1: Investigate whether maternal
hyperinsulinemia, in the absence of hyperglycemia and obesity, is sufficient to alter immune cell
composition and potentiate placental inflammation. Aim2: Examine the metabolic health trajectory of
offspring born to dams with hyperinsulinemia to assess if placental inflammation can lead to the
predisposition of metabolic diseases. These studies are highly significant because they will define the
molecular mechanisms whereby maternal hyperinsulinemia impacts metabolic health, and they
underscore the importance of clinically controlling insulin levels during pregnancy, like glucose, to
improve pregnancy outcomes. Thus, the anticipated success of this project will have significant
implications in improving women’s reproductive health and the metabolic health of the offspring."
10993894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
African American (AA) men face the highest incidence and mortality rates from prostate cancer (PCa) in the
United States. Prostate multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique capable of sensitively
detecting prostate tumors by integrating anatomical and functional information. The Prostate Imaging Reporting
and Data System (PI-RADS) currently serves as the standardized scheme for interpreting mpMRI. However, the
existing method for detecting cancerous lesions does not consider racially associated MRI characteristics, and
there is a lack of studies exploring the impact of patients' race/ethnicity on PI-RADS-based interpretation.
Our hypothesis is that racial disparities in PCa diagnosis can be reduced by incorporating racially-associated
MRI measurements with appropriate error correction. We aim to test this hypothesis in a multi-institutional setting
at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Our
interdisciplinary team plans to collect and link clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic information using patient-
specific 3D-printed prostate molds, software registration, and expert annotation before and after radical
prostatectomy. The resulting highly curated radiology-pathology dataset will be utilized to (1) characterize the
mpMRI measurement associated with the tumor microenvironment in AA and CA groups, employing co-localized
quantitative radiology-pathology analyses after error correction, (2) investigate whether racially-associated MRI-
based tissue characterization enhances the detection of aggressive PCa, and (3) develop a race/ethnicity-
specific deep learning model for improved detection of aggressive PCa.
This supplementary funding will support a dedicated graduate student, enabling her to receive additional training
in mpMRI and artificial intelligence for non-invasive imaging techniques that enhance the accuracy of risk
stratification in PCa for distinct racial/ethnic populations. Her dissertation goal is to explore the underlying
race/ethnicity-specific biological mechanisms of PCa and reduce prostate cancer health disparities between AA
and CA men through artificial intelligence. To commence her research, she will actively participate in the
acquisition and analysis of co-localized radiologic and histopathologic data with both retrospective and
prospective cohorts (Aim 1). This involvement will equip her to become proficient in the latest imaging techniques
and further investigate racially associated MRI-based tissue characterization (Aim 2). Her training will be
augmented by attending national and international annual meetings and completing courses on Medical Imaging,
MRI physics, and Artificial Intelligence, provided at UCLA. Collectively, these activities will broaden her training
and position her to make fundamental discoveries about improved PCa detection in both AA and CA men,
compared to conventional strategies, thereby reducing racial disparities in detecting aggressive forms of PCa."
10993899,"Project Summary
The use of antibiotics has significantly increased in recent years. Antibiotics (ABX) severely alter the gut
microbiome, destroying potentially pathogenic bacteria, as well as beneficial ones—producing a state of
microbial imbalance called dysbiosis. Notably, a diminished gut microbiome has severe defects on the immune
system, yet how these defects may affect cellular immunotherapy is largely unknown.
 To better understand how dysbiosis influences cellular immunotherapy, we focused on melanoma as an
exemplary immunogenic solid tumor. The incidence of melanoma has increased drastically over the past
decades, with its morbidity rate continuing to outpace that of most other cancers. Early stages of melanoma are
often successfully controlled and treated; yet patients with advanced stages of melanoma are treated with cellular
immunotherapy and only 50% respond. We hypothesize that ABX-induced dysbiosis dictates, at least in part,
the reduction in treatment efficacy.
 Our overall goal is to define the systemic effects of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on the distal tumor
microenvironment and develop therapies to promote antitumor immunity. The major objective of this application
is to overcome dysbiosis-induced ICAM-1 suppression and thereby enhance the effectiveness of cellular
immunotherapy. Attaining this objective will be the next step in increasing the efficacy and response rate of
immunotherapies. We formulated a robust and unbiased approach using various melanoma models to
accomplish the following Aims:
Aim 1. Identify ABX primarily responsible for stromal immune suppression resulting in tumor progression.
Aim 2. Increase ICAM-1 on tumor-associated endothelial cells during dysbiosis.
Aim 3. Increase cellular immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma during dysbiosis.
 Completing these aims will expand our understanding on how antibiotics-induced perturbation of the gut
microbiome impacts the distal tumor microenvironment. This work has the potential to establish new paradigms
aimed at enhancing the efficacy and response rate of immunotherapies by modulating the tumor vasculature, as
all types of immunotherapy ultimately dependent on efficient trafficking of effector leukocytes into the tumor."

weighed by the cancer risk associated with the ionizing radiaƟon used in breast x‐ray imaging modaliƟes.
To date, the SABIR database contains average glandular dose (𝐷𝑔) values that are extracted directly from
the DICOM header of that exam. The models employed by the vendors to esƟmate 𝐷𝑔 are out of date
and mistakenly assume that the breast is composed of a homogenous mixture of 50% glandular and 50%
adipose Ɵssue (hereaŌer referred to as “𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑜”). Over the last decade, advancements in 3D breast
imaging have greatly advanced our understanding of breast anatomy, parƟcularly the amount and
distribuƟon of glandular Ɵssue, which is vital for accurate dosimetry. The ﬁndings revealed that prior
esƟmaƟons of radiaƟon dose for digital mammography (DM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)
were overesƟmated by about 30% due to not accounƟng for the realisƟc heterogenous distribuƟon of
glandular Ɵssue. If we use the linear no threshold (LNT) model to predict risk as a funcƟon of dose, these
ﬁndings suggest that the radiaƟon risks of breast cancer screening and diagnosis using DM and DBT are
lowered by this same factor (30%). We therefore propose to generate new 𝐷𝑔values for the SABIR
database using the now universally accepted, realisƟc heterogenous breast model “𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜” and
explore characterisƟcs of 𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜 in digital breast tomosynthesis DM and DBT across breast density,
size, and paƟent BMI.
Speciﬁc Aim 1: Develop new esƟmaƟons of mean glandular dose using the heterogenous breast
dosimetry model (𝑫𝒈,𝒉𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒐) in both DM and DBT for the SABIR database: The breast density and
DICOM metadata for DM and DBT imaging examinaƟons will be used to generate new 𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜 using
the universal heterogeneous breast model published by EFOMP/AAPM Joint Trask Group 282.
𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑜values will be compared against exisƟng legacy 𝐷𝑔,ℎ𝑜𝑚𝑜 values across the range of
acquisiƟon characterisƟcs and breast composiƟons found in the SABIR database.
Speciﬁc Aim 2: Explore how 𝑫𝒈,𝒉𝒆𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒐 values in DM and DBT vary with breast density, compressed
breast thickness, and paƟent BMI found in the SABIR database: Eﬀects of breast density, compressed
breast thickness, and BMI will be explored for both DM and DBT examinaƟons."

Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG), which include diffuse midline glioma (DMG), are among the most lethal
of all pediatric cancers, with survival rarely exceeding two years. The most common mutations in pHGG are
found in histone variant H3.3 (H3F3A), with nearly 50% of all pHGG exhibiting gain-of-function mutations at
either lysine 27 (K27M) or glycine 34 (G34R/V). Both histone mutants result in widespread epigenetic impacts
on transcriptional control and distinct clinical behavior. Additionally, roughly 30% of pHGG harbor loss-of-
function mutations in the chromatin remodeling protein ATRX, which co-occur in about 20% of H3K27M tumors
and 90% of those with H3.3G34R/V mutations. However, there is currently no known mechanism to explain the
gap in co-mutation between the different H3F3A-mutant tumors. Studies have demonstrated the ability of
H3K27M to inhibit the catalytic function of EZH2, an H3K27 methyltransferase, and ATRX has been shown to
impact localization of PRC2, but no such association has been made for H3G34R/V mutations. EZH2, one of
the catalytic subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is responsible for maintaining repression
of many early developmental genes, including those involved in early brain development.
The overall objective of this proposal is to determine how ATRX loss impacts developmental gene expression
in H3G34R/V mutant tumor cells. The central hypothesis states that co-mutation of H3G34R/V and ATRX will
result in (i) inappropriate PRC2 localization and H3K27me3 placement, leading to (ii) expression of PRC2-
repressed neurodevelopmental genes and a subsequent increase in tumor cell growth. The preliminary data
outlined in this proposal suggests that the same set of PRC2 target genes are upregulated both by H3K27M
alone and ATRX loss/H3G34R together. The first aim assesses the role of concurrent H3F3A and ATRX
mutations on PRC2 dysfunction, which will look at both localization and function of PRC2 at known targets and
throughout the genome. The second aim will look into how H3F3A and ATRX co-mutation affects expression of
NPC marker genes and how this impacts cell proliferation and rates of tumor growth. Successful completion of
this proposal is expected to result in a clearer understanding of why ATRX loss is preferentially selected for in
H3G34R/V-mutant gliomas over H3K27M-mutant gliomas. This knowledge will result in the ability to design
and utilize more specific therapies for H3F3A-mutant gliomas, which could prolong survival in upwards of 50%
of pHGG patients."

YCC remains committed to prioritizing NCTN trials at all the YCC clinical centers and demonstrates annual accrual beyond estimates developed in our current U10 award. 
For this current submission, the vision of the YCC leadership is to: 1) continue to prioritize NCTN trials for accrual and develop YCC as a major contributor to group trials with additional contribution of our Care Centers; 2) facilitate and encourage YCC faculty to assume leadership roles in SWOG and other NCTN groups by supporting their time and effort and rewarding these activities; and 3) leverage our NCTN Coordinating Committee (NCC) as a bridge to bring Yale translational science to group activities as the results of our investigator initiated pilot trials become promising for multi-center and randomized questions. 
In addition to the leadership efforts of Dr. Fuchs, other key SWOG leaders include Drs. Roy Herbst, Daniel Petrylak and Lajos Pusztai. Drs. Peter Glazer, Roy Decker and Alessandro Santin will lead our efforts in the NRG group in addition to Dr. Barbara Burtness who will continue to lead our efforts in the ECOG-ACRIN group. We believe that the science and translational work at YCC has strong potential for incorporation into NCTN programs. Continued work on early phase drug development, EGFR resistance, PD-1 signaling, chemical biology, and new targets in signal transduction through the scientific programs of YCC have strong potential for translation into group trials. Furthermore, with expansion of the Smilow Cancer Hospital Care Centers, we demonstrated a greater opportunity to bring NCTN trials to the greater patient population across the state of Connecticut. This UG1 grant will assist us in developing the appropriate leadership and infrastructure for support of key NCTN group efforts in both accrual and program development."

Abstract
Patients with locally advanced rectal cancers face a difficult treatment course involving
neoadjuvant 5-FU based doublet or triplet chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy therapy, and
eventual surgical resection. While rates of neoadjuvant chemotherapy induce a complete
regression of tumors in a significant subset of patients (30-40%), and is associated with
significantly improved long term survival, responses remain heterogeneous with both local and
distant failures. Recently, we and others have demonstrated specific bacterial taxa within rectal
cancers are associated with a diminished response to neoadjuvant therapy. These bacteria
have been shown to lead to the inactivation of common chemotherapeutics and have the ability
to form an immune exclusionary environment within rectal cancers. While these microbial
communities can be modulated in preclinical models leading to improved response and tumor
control; there is a significant gap in our understanding of the ability to modulate these microbes
in a clinical setting. Intriguingly, clearance of a common deleterious bacterium Fusobacterium
nucleatum (Fn) through 5-FU based chemotherapy has been shown to improve recurrence free
survival in a cohort of rectal cancer patients. To understand the influence of these microbes in
rectal cancer, we propose to study banked and prospectively collected tissue from a feasibility
study of the ability of metronidazole to selectively clear deleterious anaerobes, such as Fn, and
the effect this has to augment 5-FU Fn killing. This will be coupled with translational studies of
both the tumor immune microenvironment comparing the tumors of patients able to achieve
durable complete responses as compared to those with persistent viable tumor post
neoadjuvant therapy. Finally, we will study the spatial immune and bacterial profile of the tumors
of patients that either do or do not clear tumoral Fn to better understand barriers to clearing
these deleterious anaerobes and potentially improve outcomes and increase inclusion of watch
and wait protocols in the near future. We hypothesize this study will identify active immune
infiltrates correlate with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy while inactive or absent
immune infiltrates will correlate with the presence of high-risk microbes and a lack of response"

Impaired intestinal epithelial healing can contribute to chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
Current IBD therapies target the immune response without addressing intestinal epithelial repair defects, which
may contribute to risk of relapse in patients with IBD. Studying intestinal epithelial repair will lead to a better
understanding of IBD pathogenesis as well as novel therapies that may be more effective than current therapies.
Intestinal epithelial homeostasis is maintained by adult stem cells that reside at the base of the crypt. When
these stem cells are injured or depleted, other differentiated cells in the epithelium, specifically secretory cells,
can de-differentiate and replenish the epithelium. A specific secretory cell type, Paneth cells, are found at the
base of the crypt intercalated between the stem cells, putting them in a prime location to replace stem cells when
they are ablated. However, mechanisms of Paneth cell plasticity are unknown. Our lab recently showed that cells
with high autophagic vesicle content were identified as having stem-like capacity via their ability to generate
organoids after being seeded as single cells. These findings and other studies showing that autophagy is
necessary for the intestinal epithelium to recover after injury, suggest that autophagy may play an important role
in this de-differentiation process. Additionally, recent studies have shown that after injury, the intestinal
epithelium upregulates fetal-like reversion genes and no longer expresses differentiated cell genes, suggesting
a reversion to a more plastic and undifferentiated state. Though both autophagy and fetal-like reversion have
been suggested to be mechanisms for de-differentiation, it is not clear whether these two processes are related.
Therefore, I hypothesize that Paneth cells require autophagy to transition through a fetal-like state to de-
differentiate following epithelial tissue injury. In Aim 1, I will determine if autophagy is necessary for Paneth
cells to de-differentiate. In Aim 2, I will test whether the increase in organoid formation from Paneth cells with
high autophagic vesicle content is due to an increased ability to upregulate fetal-like reversion genes through
YAP signaling. These aims will define a role for autophagy in Paneth cell plasticity and whether expression of
fetal-like reversion genes contribute to this process. This work will provide a basis for understanding why patients
with IBD have impaired epithelial healing and may lead to novel therapeutics focusing on epithelial cell
autophagy."

Tooth and alveolar bone health are essential for proper oral functions of feeding, chewing, speaking, and other
essential activities of daily life. Alveolar bone loss due to periodontitis and tooth cracking are the second and
third most common reasons for tooth loss. Elucidating the molecular regulation of dentin synthesis and alveolar
osteogenesis will contribute to filling the significant knowledge gap and finding new molecules to target for
therapeutics. The runt related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) is the master regulator of skeletogenesis. Humans
harboring mutations in the RUNX2 gene exhibit cleidocranial dysplasia, which is characterized by both dental
and various skeletal anomalies. Global deletion of Runx2 gene in mice results in complete failure of ossification
and embryonic lethality. Our previous work has demonstrated that Runx2 is required for the differentiation of
the resting chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes and endochondral ossification. We have also shown
that Runx2 gene deletion in developing osteoblasts impairs the postnatal synthesis of long bone and the
acquisition of adult bone mass. Our preliminary data show a surprisingly significant increase in dentin
synthesis in mice with Runx2-deficient odontoblasts and a concomitant decrease in bone synthesis and bone
mass by Runx2-deficient osteoblasts. Furthermore, the microenvironments of alveolar osteoblasts compared to
long bone osteoblasts are fundamentally different. These osteoblasts have different origins, pathogen
exposure, and loading forces. Therefore, we hypothesize that Runx2 is required for postnatal dentin
synthesis and alveolar osteogenesis. We further postulate that the gene expression profiles of alveolar and
long bone osteoblasts are fundamentally different.
We will experimentally test these hypotheses in the following proposed aims: In Aim 1, we plan to elucidate the
regulatory role of Runx2 in committed odontoblasts for dentin synthesis. Aim 2 is focused on determining the
critical differences in Runx2 regulated alveolar and long bone osteogenesis. The proposed experiments will
utilize unique mouse models to answer fundamental mechanistic questions about the differential regulation of
dentin and alveolar bone synthesis by Runx2. This application builds on a strong interdisciplinary scientific
environment and institutional support to train successful clinician-scientists in the field of oral and maxillofacial
regeneration. This combination is necessary for my goals of becoming an independent researcher as an oral
and maxillofacial surgeon-scientist. The findings from the proposed experiments will uncover Runx2-regulated
pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets for dentin and alveolar bone repair and regeneration.
Additionally, understanding the functional differences between alveolar and long bone osteoblasts will enhance
craniofacial and orthopedic therapies."
10983269,"Alzheimer Disease (AD) pathogenesis is multifactorial involving multiple cell types which offers several points of
intervention. Microglia, the innate immune cell of the brain, are implicated in AD risk and pathogenesis. However,
microglia are phenotypically diverse, and which microglial activities are most relevant to AD are not yet known.
Until recently, studies to find microglia signatures in human brain tissue were limited by microglia numbers
precluding a full appreciation of how microglial states may change or contribute to the disease course. With the
explosion of human brain single cell omics studies the field is now empowered to more clearly define regulation
of microglia in aging and disease. However, resolving microglial states from human brain omic data is particularly
complicated as they are less transcriptomically distinct from each other than different brain cell types are from
each other. Better approaches are needed to uncover the suspected subtle microglial changes happening early
in disease progression. To address this problem and nominate additional AD relevant microglial states we
integrate our novel Explainable AI technique with our deep learning method, ContrastiveVI designed to overcome
heterogeneity in samples and pull-out subtle cell states. We hypothesize that our novel AI approach will enable
better distinction of AD specific pathways from general aging. Two examples of microglial AD altered pathways
we and others have identified are neuronal surveillance and microglial motility. However, it is not clear to what
degree these nuanced AD microglia states reflect responses to neuronal damage or pathologic proteins or both.
As proof of concept to study computationally identified pathways, we will model the concomitant stressors of AD
stimuli and neuronal injury due to aging. We will expose microglia-neuron hiPSC cultures to Aβ, tau and UV
irradiated neuronal conditioned media and perform functional and single cell RNA single nuclei-ATAC
sequencing. We will validate computationally predicted AD microglial genetic drivers and pathways with network
analysis of our in vitro perturbation models. We further hypothesize that the presence of AD pathologic proteins
alters computationally predicted AD specific microglia pathways in the setting of neuronal injury which we will
test using functional assays. These complementary studies innovate approaches to single cell brain datasets to
find the subtleties of microglial AD states while leveraging iPSC perturbation in vitro studies in a controlled setting
to systematically test specific pathways and determine the impacts of specific perturbation on gene regulation."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder that impacts millions of people worldwide.
Patients with SCD undergo chronic hemolysis which results in the release of large amounts of free heme, the
small molecule co-factor of hemoglobin. Free heme levels are elevated in SCD patients and free heme
activates many pro-inflammatory pathways. Heme-induced inflammation contributes to the major
complications of SCD including acute vaso-occlusion (painful blockages of blood vessels), acute chest
syndrome (life-threatening acute lung injury), and chronic pain. Many patients develop these serious
complications even while taking existing standard of care therapies. Thus, it is critical to characterize the
inflammatory mechanisms that underlie these complications to hasten the development of effective targeted
therapies.
Our lab identified a key pro-inflammatory protein activated by heme, caspase-4. Once activated, caspase-4
induces IL-1β release and pyroptosis, a form of inflammatory cell death, in macrophages. Circulating IL-1β
levels are elevated in patients with SCD and macrophages from patients with SCD release significantly more
IL-1β after heme exposure indicating this pathway is upregulated and active in patients. However, it remains
unknown how heme activates caspase-4 and how caspase-4 activation contributes to inflammatory
complications of SCD.
To fill this gap in knowledge and explore the suitability of caspase-4 as a druggable target in SCD, this project
will address the following two aims: 1) determine how heme activates caspase-4 through binding interaction
studies and mutagenesis and 2) determine the impact of heme-induced caspase-4 activation on inflammatory
complications of SCD in a SCD mouse model. The long-term goal of this project is to develop therapeutics to
inhibit this pathway and prevent inflammatory complications in patients. The collaborative training environment
at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital, the cutting-edge core facilities at these
institutions, and the many experts in hematology and innate immunity in the Texas Medical Center will
strongly support the success of this project. Overall, this project will comprehensively prepare the applicant for
a future career as a hematologist-scientist while providing important insights into the underlying
pathophysiology of sickle cell disease."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common sustained cardiac arrhythmia with associated risks that include stroke, heart
failure, and death. Despite the public health burden, our understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of AF
remains incomplete, and this is reflected in the lack of therapeutic advancement. This proposal aims to leverage
the clinical and scientific expertise that Dr. Bapat has developed thus far to explore a novel pathway in AF, all
while allowing him to grow as a scientist under the direct mentorship and guidance of two very accomplished
physician scientists.
 Dr. Bapat has produced substantial data working with mouse models of AF. He contributed to a recent
publication that identified murine deficiency of Zfhx3, a gene implicated in human AF, as pathologic, leading to
atrial arrhythmia, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction. In addition, he has extensively studied mouse models of
“acquired” AF resulting from obesity or sepsis. In exciting preliminary data, non-canonical WNT signaling has
been noted to be upregulated in both genres of AF pathogenesis. As the downstream consequences include
effects on calcium handling, stress signaling, inflammation, and fibrosis, there is a feasible biological link that
warrants further exploration. In addition, Dr. Bapat has demonstrated the efficacy of inhibiting serum
glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1), which lies downstream to non-canonical WNT signaling, in models of obesity-
related AF. This proposal’s overarching objective is to better define the role of non-canonical WNT signaling in
various models of AF and then determine whether intervening on this signaling pathway may be protective.
 First, Dr. Bapat proposes to expand upon our existing understanding of ZFHX3-deficiency related atrial
pathology by addressing any possible confounding related to developmental effects. He has generated mice
with inducible, cardiac-restricted Zfhx3 deficiency, and will study their cardiac phenotype, with a particular
interest on WNT signaling and AF propensity. He then will study a model of sepsis-related AF, generated by
performing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Preliminary data reveals an upregulation in WNT signaling and
SGK1 activation, and he will attempt to rescue arrhythmogenesis with genetic SGK1 inhibition. Finally, he will
utilize a multi-omic assay to understand the transcriptional effects of CLP on atrial tissue that may be driving
arrhythmogenesis. This work will take place in the Cardiovascular Research Center at the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) and at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard under the mentorship of Dr. Patrick Ellinor,
the Chief of Cardiology at MGH, and Dr. Saumya Das, an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School.
 Dr. Bapat’s goal is to become an independent basic scientist with expertise in the mechanistic basis for
cardiac arrhythmias. He is dedicated to becoming an independent investigator and to use the research performed
for the K08 as a springboard for an R01 application in the future."
10984745,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative brain disease. The major symptoms are impairments in
memory and cognitive functions. These changes accompany a significant loss of dendritic spines and, eventually,
neurons themselves. A defining pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of amyloid plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. There has been remarkable progress in understanding the
pathophysiological processes leading to this cellular pathology. Despite this progress, little is known about
molecular interventions to restore dendritic and memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease models. Converging lines
of evidence have documented a significant alteration in the subcellular distribution of calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIa), which is a critical memory molecule, in many Alzheimer's disease
models. Evidence also indicates a close link between CaMKIIa dysregulation and tau pathology (phosphorylation
and inclusion) in various Alzheimer's disease models, highlighting CaMKIIa as a significant target molecule to
be intervened to restore the deficits seen in Alzheimer's disease. As such, approaches capable of redirecting
this dysregulation of CaMKIIa may offer unique avenues for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In this
application, we propose to explore this possibility. Our recent work reported a novel intrabody that specifically
targets N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) located at the core of dendritic spines. We found that adeno-
associated virus (AAV)-mediated delivery of CaMKIIa conjugated with the anti-NMDAR intrabody results in
postsynapse-targeted local enrichment of exogenous CaMKIIa in the mouse hippocampus and a significant
increase in contextual fear memory of mice. Therefore, based on the complex formation and dynamics of
CaMKIIa, we propose to evaluate our molecular intervention in reversing the CaMKIIa dysregulation, tau
phosphorylation, dendritic spinopathy, and memory deficits in in vitro and in vivo models of Alzheimer's disease.
Knowledge of the functional roles of CaMKIIa dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease and subsequent tau
abnormality will clarify the pathways of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and has the potential to accelerate
progress toward Alzheimer's disease treatments by challenging the key memory pathway with a new but
validated molecular approach based on a solid foundation of knowledge in synapse biology."
10984187,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Immunotherapy has revolutionized how oncologists treat cancer patients. One type of immunotherapy includes
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as those that engage PD-1 on cytotoxic CD8+ T cells to bolster their
effector functions. However, in several cancer types, single-agent therapy is moderately effective, but when
combined with standard-of-care (SOC) chemotherapy, the combination regimen improves overall response
rates. Therapeutic efficacy may be hampered by numerous barriers, including the immune suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME). One major cellular component of the TME includes myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs), which correlate with poorer survival outcomes and suppress antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells in
response to these ICIs. To overcome these obstacles of immune suppression, we developed a novel approach
to target MDSC ‘biogenesis’ in the bone marrow to mitigate their production and function, and boost ICI activity
in mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a cancer type that elicits a robust MDSC response.
We identified a metabolic vulnerability in MDSCs and targeted that dependency using agents known as
dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors. DHODH inhibitors block de novo pyrimidine metabolism and
are being clinically tested as a therapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We found that combining the DHODH inhibitor,
brequinar (BRQ), with PD-1 blockade significantly reduced tumor growth, and that therapeutic efficacy depended
upon a reduction in MDSC suppressive activity. However, tumors still grew introducing two important gaps. First,
it remains unclear how DHODH blockade ‘reprograms’ MDSC function and, secondly, it remains unclear how
therapeutic efficacy can be further augmented. Regarding the first gap, in Aim 1 of the F99 phase, we will focus
on the unfolded protein response (UPR) based on the rationale that we found that the UPR pathway is one of
the top downregulated pathways in myeloid progenitors that give rise to MDSCs and that prior work in the field
showed that the UPR is a key pathway by which MDSCs mediate their activities, particularly, via the transcription
factor XBP1. Regarding the second gap, we propose to build on a SOC chemo-immunotherapy platform to
augment antitumor responses. Therefore, in Aim 2 of the K00 phase, we will determine whether incorporating
BRQ to a paclitaxel/anti-PD-1 monoclonal Ab regimen, which is clinically used in TNBC, bolsters CD8+ T cell
responses and achieves durable antitumor immunity. Our central hypothesis is that DHODH blockade
reprograms MDSCs toward less immune suppressive states through an XBP1-dependent mechanism in the
UPR pathway. We further hypothesize that MDSC mitigation through this pathway will further sensitize TNBC to
a SOC chemo-immunotherapy regimen. New advances gained from this research have the potential to inform
the clinical design of novel, more effective combination immunotherapies."

The quality of care for the over 800,000 residents of US nursing homes (NH) with Alzheimer's disease or
related dementias (ADRD) is variable and outcomes are poor. The physician and advanced practitioner
(predominantly nurse practitioner) workforce plays a key role in the quality of care for NH residents with ADRD,
who tend to be more clinically complex and require more care coordination compared to residents without
ADRD. These clinicians work with direct care NH staff to diagnose and treat acute complaints, manage chronic

practice interventions to achieve higher quality care with better outcomes and l ower utilization of
avoidable healthcare that is particularly harmful in this population. Thus,
different NH
our long-term goal is to
improve the quality of care for NH residents with ADRD by evaluating and disseminating information on high-
performing NH clinician care models. To do so, we will survey a nationally representative sample of NH
clinicians about their practice characteristics, organization, processes of care, and degree of co-management
between different provider types. Next, we will link these data on NH clinician – predominantly NP-physician
models - to Medicare claims and the NH Minimum Data Set to measure the outcomes and costs of care for NH
residents with ADRD. We hypothesize that NH residents with ADRD under the care of clinicians with a high
degree of co-management (scores in the top vs. bottom quartile on the co-management scale) have better
outcomes (slower decline in functional status, fewer ambulatory care sensitive hospitalizations) and lower
costs (facility and professional payments by Medicare) compared to clinicians with a low degree of co-
management. This evidence will inform efforts by policymakers and NH providers to improve health outcomes
and reduce costs for NH residents with ADRD by aligning reimbursement, scope of practice, and regulations
mandating the timing of clinician visits, better supporting high-performing clinician care models for residents
with ADRD."
10984196,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Bacterial coinfections have been the leading cause of severe illness and mortality during past
Influenza pandemics and current seasonal endemics. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common
etiological agent reported during Influenza-associated secondary infections. Unfortunately, the epithelial and
immunological mechanisms resulting in increased pneumococcal invasion, persistence, and dissemination
in the Influenza aftermath remain poorly understood. Preliminary data suggest that Microfold (M) cells arise
in the lung epithelium during the resolution phase of Influenza-associated inflammation when susceptibility
to pneumococcal infections is maximum. Highly endocytic intestinal M cells play a crucial role in gut immune
surveillance by directly delivering luminally captured antigens to underlying dendritic cells, eliciting antigen-
specific mucosal immunity. However, M cells in the gut are occasionally hijacked and serve as entry portals
for pathogenic dissemination into the host. Having been only recently identified, our knowledge of lung M cell
functions in pulmonary infection and immunity is scant. Our single-cell transcriptomic analysis of the murine
airway epithelium reveals M cell-specific expression of novel transcytosis receptors, chemokines, and
regulators of endocytic trafficking with immunomodulatory properties. This proposal aims to define the
functional role of lung M cells in predisposition to influenza-associated pneumococcal invasion and ensuing
pneumonia and sepsis. We further aim to identify the intracellular trafficking mechanisms during
pneumococcal transcytosis across airway M cells. The proposed research goals will be achieved by
employing in vitro and in vivo models of M cell induction in the lower airways coupled with genetically
engineered mouse models for M cell ablation and innovative live imaging platforms. This study will shed light
on the M cell-driven mechanisms promoting invasive pneumococcal disease and will inform the development
of ingenious therapeutic strategies to target epithelial entry portals, thus preventing bacterial superinfections
in the background of viral infections. The proposed research plan will be executed at the MGH Center for
Regenerative Medicine (CRM), Boston, under the mentorship of Dr. Jayaraj Rajagopal, an expert in the field
of airway epithelial biology and lung regeneration. My career objective is to become a tenure-track faculty
pioneering and simultaneously training next-generation scientists in the field of lung infections and immunity.
To accomplish my career goals, I have put together a comprehensive training plan to enhance the overall
skill sets required to establish myself as a successful independent investigator. To ensure timely progress
toward fulfilling my rigorous research plan and career goals, I have gathered an expert advisory committee
comprising Dr. Dennis Brown, Dr. Jatin Vyas, and Dr. David Scadden, with whom I will regularly discuss my
research progress and receive invaluable career development guidance, the key ingredient to my pathway
to scientific independence."
10984201,"Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common form of neurodegenerative dementia, behind only
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). LBD is clinically defined as a dementia that arises prior to or within one year of a
Parkinson’s disease (PD) diagnosis or PD with subsequent dementia. Post-mortem examination of LBD brains
commonly reveals a combined pathology of intraneuronal Lewy bodies along with amyloid plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles consistent with AD. As such, LBD is considered one of the Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias (ADRDs). A small subset of genes implicated in other neurologic diseases influence risk for
LBD (e.g. GBA1, APOE), while many genes determinant for familial forms of AD or PD do not. These data
suggest a meaningful partial overlap of neurodegenerative disease genes with regards to LBD. While APOE
has recently received attention regarding its influence on both amyloid and alpha-synuclein pathology, GBA1
has not been as thoroughly examined. Autosomal recessive missense mutations in the GBA1 gene cause the
lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher’s disease. Intriguingly, recent work demonstrates that GBA1 is also the
greatest risk factor for LBD. The molecular mechanisms through which GBA1 mutations may evoke this unique
clinical presentation and complex neuropathology are not known. Our data demonstrate novel Golgi-related
dysfunction in GBA1 mutant cells, upstream to the lysosomal and late endosomal events important to alpha-
synuclein and APP processing, respectively. Here, we will use wildtype induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
neurons, as well as matched isogenic neurons harboring multiple pathogenic GBA1 mutations, to examine the
influence of GBA1 on the regulation, trafficking, and maturation of key lysosomal proteins thought to be
involved in the metabolism of alpha-synuclein. We will also examine the resulting changes in alpha-synuclein
degradation and neuronal release, and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein species recently discovered in
human LBD brain tissue. In addition, the effect of pathogenic mutation in GBA1 linked to LBD on gamma-
secretase and APP biology will be mechanistically and pathologically interrogated here both in vitro and in vivo.
Lastly, emerging clinical and biochemical data demonstrate that GBA1 and LRRK2 interact in both
physiological and disease-relevant ways. LRRK2 mutations causal for PD appear to decrease risk of dementia
in GBA1 patients. Thus, to model these dual-mutation carriers, we will examine neurons with GBA1 mutation
alone or those also expressing pathogenic LRRK2 mutations and assess pathways relevant to synucleinopathy
and amyloidogenesis described above. This work will directly investigate novel pathways with the potential to
understand the novel clinical phenotypes and mixed AD/PD pathology in LBD. Our approach exploits the
genetic and molecular intersections of multiple neurodegenerative diseases with the goal of understanding
both the similarities and differences in their etiologies."

unequally oﬀered to people with disabilities. While making data and visualization resources accessible and
useful is vital in genomics education, research, and clinical se ings, genomics resources such as data portals,
visualizations, and research papers largely fail to meet accessibility standards according to our preliminary
evaluation (96.3% of 2,936 evaluated portals), making essential resources rather inaccessible to people with
visual impairments. My overarching goal is to include disability in the genomics workforce by enhancing the
accessibility of data and visualization resources. This project proposes three speciﬁc aims: (1) conducting
accessibility evaluations of biomedical resources, (2) developing accessible visual and textual representations
for genomics data and novel tools based on them, and (3) implementing accessible graphical user interfaces for
genomics data analysis. I will conduct a series of comprehensive accessibility evaluations of biomedical
resources with input from users. Based on the evaluation results, I will build accessibility guidelines for
biomedical resources and their priorities based on diﬀerent use cases which will complement general
accessibility guidelines. The evaluations will unveil critical aspects of potential improvements and oﬀer
guidance toward accessible biomedical resources. Second, by extending my earlier work on the Gosling
grammar-based genomics data visualization, I will help content creators to build accessible genomics data
tables and visualizations which will oﬀer smart accessibility defaults and out-of-the-box accessibility features.
Based on the extended Gosling, I will develop an assistive toolkit that will automatically generate missing
metadata and reﬁne the structure of web pages to enable viewing currently inaccessible data tables and ﬁgures
in existing web-based genomics resources. Given the complexity and scale of genomics data, user interactions,
such as zooming and panning, are essential techniques for genomics data analysis. However, traditional
mouse-based interactions are largely inaccessible without accurate vision. As the last aim, I propose to design
accessible and intuitive user interactions tailored for genomics visualization, such as keyboard-based
interactions. Building on top of the accessible interactions, I will build an accessibility-friendly graphical user
interface (GUI) platform that enables people with visual impairments to create visualizations and analyze
genomics data. The novel tools I will develop will not only help content creators to eﬃciently and accurately
create accessible visualizations but also enable current and prospective genomics students, researchers, and
clinicians with visual impairments to access, interpret, and analyze genomics data, making data-driven
genomics research more inclusive."

Children who are born preterm are at a high risk for developing sensorimotor deficits. Though a majority of
children born preterm do not have a neuromuscular diagnosis such as cerebral palsy, many have mild to
moderate motor delays. These motor delays fall under the diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder or
developmental dyspraxia, a condition with difficulties in motor planning and coordination, that is theoretically
linked to somatosensory deficits. We hypothesize that deficit in somatosensory processing may precede this
diagnosis in preterm children, but these deficits are not identified due to a lack of reliable and valid assessment
methods for use with young children.
Somatic sensations refer to sensory information from the body, including touch and proprioception.
Proprioception -- the sense that lets us know how and where our body is moving -- is considered one of the
most important senses for controlling movements. Based on research on motor learning in adults, we know the
importance of accurate proprioception information on the control of movements. Difficulties in somatosensory
information will impact a developing nervous system’s ability to learn new motor skills. This effect theoretically
compounds as the child learns more motor skills with inaccurate somatosensory feedback, laying a poor
foundation for further learning. However, our current understanding of how the sensory and motor systems
interact in a developing nervous system is limited.
The poor understanding of somatosensory in development is in part due to the lack of accurate assessments
that measure somatosensory processing in young children. Current somatosensory assessments are limited to
clinical observations and parent reports on the child’s behavior, which lack objectivity and do not provide a
standard for comparison. Without objective assessments of somatosensory processing in young children,
somatosensory processing deficits are often not identified until later in their childhood, when they present with
motor delays.
We developed and pilot tested innovative methods to measure somatosensory processing in children as young
as 1 year old. The overall objectives of this project is to study somatosensory development in young children,
develop a method to identify children who have challenges with somatosensory processing, and to examine
the predictive relationship between somatosensory processing challenges in early childhood with later motor
development. We hypothesize that somatosensory develop play a major role in predicting motor skill
development and participation in activities of daily living in children who were born preterm.
This study is part of a larger research program that aims to better our understanding of somatosensory
development in children. We strive for early identification of children with somatosensory deficits, and to
develop targeted interventions for these deficits in children."

Shortly after fertilization, a dramatic reprogramming of the genome and transcriptome occurs, enabling the
embryo to develop quickly and robustly. This is especially exemplified in the Drosophila embryo, which within a
two-hour period undergoes 13 mitotic cycles, cellularizes the blastoderm, patterns the body plan, and gets ready
for gastrulation. While the gene networks underlying these processes have been well studied, it is not clear how
they are collectively initiated, a process referred to as zygotic genome activation. Moreover, although it was
observed that DNA replication occurs before transcription, the mechanisms that control this timing are not known.
Previously, we demonstrated that a single factor, Zelda, acts globally to activate early-expressed genes. We
found that Zelda binding to CAGGTAG sites across the genome lowers nucleosome barriers at enhancers,
thereby facilitating the binding of other key transcription factors. Zelda and these other factors are present in
sub-nuclear “hubs” (discrete foci) that were seen to colocalize at enhancers. We aim to use high-resolution
microscopy to investigate the which structural features of Zelda mediate hub formation. In addition, we are
interested in the regulatory mechanisms that control the timing of transcription and DNA replication so that
conflicts between the two processes are avoided. We propose that Zelda plays a dual pioneering role: 1) to open
chromatin for the Origin Recognition Complex to load and subsequent formation of the Pre-replication Complex,
which occludes the transcriptional machinery until origins have fired, and 2) to open newly formed chromatin for
transcription to initiate. Our goal is to first define origins of replication in early embryos, and to characterize
Zelda's role in origin licensing and transcriptional initiation. Our studies will lend into how these two fundamental
processes of DNA replication and transcription are coordinated during genome activation."

The goal of this project is to determine whether it is possible to promote the development and/or
maintenance of CD8+ T cells that are essential for anti-tumor responses to PD-1 immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB) therapy by targeting PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein-1). Studies of exhausted CD8 T cells
(TEX) with chronic LCMV infection identified that terminally dysfunctional TEX (TTEX) arise by the progressive
differentiation of less exhausted cells with the capacity for effector functions, and that these cells derive from
stem-cell like, PD-1+ self-renewing cells (TSC) expressing the transcription factor TCF-1. Although not yet as well
studied in cancer, the progeny of TSC, designated precursor exhausted T cells (TPEX), are found in mouse models
of melanoma and in melanoma cancer patient tumors where their frequencies predict responses to PD-1 ICB.
The identification of these subsets is considered to be paradigm shifting since TEX were previously thought to
minimally alter their anti-tumor responses because of epigenetic stability. However, induction of TPEX responses
by PD-1 ICB causes rapid TEX differentiation and increased numbers of TTEX contributing to immunotherapy
resistance. Thus, a fundamental question is whether TSC and/or TPEX can be generated/maintained to increase
patient responses and progression free survival with PD-1 ICB. We identified an unexpected function of PSGL-
1 as a T cell intrinsic checkpoint inhibitor in responses to chronic viral infection and tumors. PSGL-1 acts
upstream of PD-1 to promote the upregulation of multiple inhibitory receptors (IRs) and TTEX differentiation during
chronic antigen stimulation. Although VISTA, a PD-L1 homologue, was shown to be a ligand for PSGL-1 in vitro,
its function in vivo has not been established, and its binding to PSGL-1 may be a critical driver of TEX
differentiation. We showed that PSGL-1 engagement together with TCR signaling elicits TTEX development from
both human and mouse effector T cells in vitro, underscoring its integral connection to immune inhibitory
pathways and relevance to human anti-tumor responses. In contrast, PSGL-1 deficiency prevents TTEX
development by overcoming the inhibition of TCR signaling conferred by chronic stimulation, thereby promoting
significant control of an anti-PD-1 resistant melanoma. Notably, this outcome is recapitulated with PSGL-1
blockade, the focus of this application. With PSGL-1-/- T cells, we find greater frequencies of CD8 T cells that
retain effector functions and express genes which identify TSC/TPEX, including TCF-1. Using PD-1 ICB resistant
melanoma models in addition to melanoma patient samples, we propose test the hypothesis that PSGL-1
blockade promotes the generation and/or persistence of TSC and TPEX by preventing engagement of VISTA or
other novel ligand(s). We will determine the fate of these cells with PSGL-1 ICB, alone and together with anti-
PD-1. We will test novel monoclonal anti-human PSGL-1 antibodies for their ability to support TPEX differentiation
or block TTEX differentiation to enhance anti-tumor T cell responses and to corroborate the potential for clinical
targeting of PSGL-1 as a novel immunotherapy."
10981284,"Humoral immunity provides protection from pathogenic viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections and is mediated
by antibodies that are produced following the differentiation of B cells into antibody secreting cells (ASC). Both
T cell independent and dependent processes contribute to the formation of ASC, as well as memory B cells
(MBC); each of which can provide lifelong immunity. Although major transcription factor networks and gene
expression changes that occur when B cells differentiate to ASC have been described, the transcriptional and
epigenetic mechanisms by which B cells adopt an early heritable cell fate program that determines ASC fate
versus one of memory and how initial and recall immune responses are programmed is still largely unknown. As
evidenced by the absolute need to create vaccines and other immune-based therapies to treat emerging
diseases, such as that caused by SARS-CoV2, it is essential that we have a full understanding of the pathways
that control the cell fate choices made by B cells. When stimulated in vivo, mouse naïve B cells undergo eight
cellular divisions as they differentiate to ASC. Each of these divisions is associated with a unique epigenetic
program that orchestrates a distinct transcriptional program providing the structure and machinery to regulate
proliferation, metabolism, stress responses, and pathways that are necessary to form an ASC. We recently
observed that instead of a single pathway arising from in vivo B cell activation, two branches emerged during
early cell divisions. One leads to ASC; whereas the other (termed non-ASC branch) expresses pre-MBC genes,
suggesting that it is the differentiation path to an MBC. Each cell fate path or branch express a unique set of
transcription factors that influence how a B cell will respond to stimulation. Aim 1 will determine which of these
differentially expressed factors contribute to this early decision and determine their regulatory targets that drive
cell fate choice. Aim 1 will also seek to understand the roles played by three epigenetic modifiers (EZH2, UTX
and LSD1) that alter ASC formation and determine how their absence alters B cell fate choices. Little is known
about the cell intrinsic mechanisms (epigenetic and transcriptional programming) that allow MBC to respond to
antigen more quickly. Our data show that MBC have a unique chromatin accessibility profile that suggests that
they can respond more quickly because they are epigenetically preprogrammed to differentiate. Thus, Aim 2
will determine: how memory B cells respond more quickly to antigen rechallenge, rely on the above epigenetic
modifiers to form ASC, and whether they follow the same fate determining choices as naïve cells. This will be
tested in vivo using a series of reporter mice and Cre recombinase-drivers, conditional knockouts for the above
epigenetic modifiers, and epigenomic/transcriptomic assays. Results from our study will provide a molecular
understanding of how B cells respond to antigen and differentiate through multiple pathways leading to immunity
and will provide new clues to how to better develop immune therapeutics and vaccines."
10981344,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic illnesses of childhood. The involved treatment regi-
men, including daily insulin administration/pump management, frequent blood glucose checks, and careful
tracking of food intake, places a high stress burden on patients. Adolescence is a risky time for T1D
management given a marked decline in treatment adherence. Over 80% of adolescents with T1D have
glycemic control that does not reach target levels (A1c 7.0%), and one significant risk factor is the increase in
negative affectivity, including depression and anxiety symptoms. Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms
affect 40% of teens with T1D. Our preliminary data support the notion that negative affectivity contributes to
diminished treatment adherence and worsening of glycemia, partially through the effects of negative
affectivity on stress-related behavior such as maladaptive eating behavior. The use of novel, targeted
interventions, tailored for the developmental needs of adolescents with T1D and the particular burdens of
coping with their chronic illness, that are translatable and able to be disseminated into clinics are needed.
Our pilot work adapted, with the collaboration of stakeholders, a 7-week, group mindfulness-based intervention
based on Learning to BREATHE, BREATHE-T1D, and a health education comparison condition, HealthEd-
T1D, for adolescents with T1D. This pilot study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of participation in
both groups with the ultimate goal of improving glycemic control via improvements to mood and therefore less
disordered eating, avoidant coping, less impulsivity, and better self-care. The primary goal of the current
proposal is to conduct a full-scale efficacy trial of BREATHE-T1D as compared to HealthEd-T1D across two
sites, Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC and the University of Colorado in Denver. The study will
be a pragmatic clinical trial with another primary aim to conduct a pilot feasibility study of implementation of a
group-based intervention for negative affect via an in-clinic screening and program referral process consistent
with the Fit to Context Framework’s Design Phase. The feasibility and acceptability of the screening and
referral process will be assessed via documentation of screening rates as well as qualitative interviews and
implementation survey measures with clinic staff and providers. This goal is to evaluate the screening and
referral process into the program within the ultimate setting in which it will be delivered, if efficacious. The
result of the current study will be a feasible and acceptable clinic screening and referral process across
multiple clinics and an efficacious group-based, virtual intervention tailored for adolescents with T1D designed
for the settings in which it will ultimately be implemented. The multidisciplinary and multi-site study team
contributes complementary areas of expertise in adolescents with T1D, behavioral intervention development,
negative affectivity and maladaptive eating behavior, adolescent mindfulness-based intervention, culturally-
relevant care, qualitative data analysis, and dissemination and implementation."

Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a critical role in the pathology of inflammatory joint diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Under chronic inflammation, FLS undergo
epigenetic remodeling and are transformed into aggressive cancer-like cells, which evade apoptosis, proliferate,
and produce catabolic factors that degrade the articular cartilage and subchondral bone. Once, transformed, the
FLS are known to retain their aggressive properties despite removing them from the inflammatory
microenvironment. Epigenetic remodeling is suggested as the underlying cause for the persistently transformed
phenotype of the FLS. However, the identity of the factors that drive the epigenetic remodeling of the FLS is
incompletely understood. In this proposal, we will focus on defining the roles of an epigenetic hub protein
SETBP1 (Set binding protein 1) in regulating the switch from a homeostatic epigenomic signature to an arthritic
epigenomic signature of the FLS. SETBP1 is an epigenetic hub protein that recruits various types of histone
remodeling complexes to activate or repress gene expression. Previous studies show that gain-of-function and
loss-of-function mutations or deletions of SETBP1 result in impaired embryogenesis and skeletogenesis. Our
preliminary data suggest that SETBP1 also plays a role in maintaining the homeostasis of FLS in adult joints.
Based on these findings we propose our overarching hypothesis that the downregulation of SETBP1 promotes
joint degeneration in IJD. We propose that SETBP1 acts as an epigenetic switch by repressing pro-inflammatory
genes and by repressing anti-inflammatory gene expression. We will test this hypothesis by the conditional
inactivation of Setbp1 in adult joints in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. In Aim 1 we will use phenotypic
and molecular analysis to show a negative interaction between the inflammation and SETBP1. Under Aim 2 we
will investigate if the level of SETBP1 protein determines the epigenetic status of the FLS and thereby drives
their transformation. Under Aim 3 we will investigate the upstream molecular mechanism for SETBP1
expression. Successful completion of this proposal will establish SETBP1 as an epigenetic switch factor in the
FLS. Our results will suggest that SETBP1 is a therapeutic target to prevent drug resistance and the recurrence
of symptoms in autoimmune joint diseases."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as
NOT-CA-21-100.
 This proposal seeks to support Dr. Laura Stafman, a pediatric surgeon-scientist with both
research and clinical interests in pediatric solid tumors. This proposal builds upon her previous basic
science work while also deviating into the disparate field of metabolomics to allow her to establish herself as an
independent surgeon-scientist.
 Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor outside the brain. It has a poor prognosis and
for those who do survive, high morbidity. Those with high-risk disease have a survival rate around 50%. However,
there is a subset of tumors that are more differentiated and occur in younger patients. Some of these require no
treatment at all and either regress or differentiate into benign tumors spontaneously. These patients have been
shown to express more differentiation genes. Within neuroblastoma there are varying degrees of differentiation;
patients with undifferentiated disease have the worst prognosis. Treatment aimed to induce differentiation is
used in neuroblastoma given its ability to progress cells from a stem cell-like state to a more mature, differentiated
state. Cancer stem cells are a small subset of cells responsible for tumor initiation, recurrence, and drug
resistance. Differentiation, stemness, and metabolism are all linked together as metabolism controls stemness
and differentiation. If we can reprogram the cell metabolism from patients with undifferentiated neuroblastoma
or cancer stem cells (poor prognosis) to behave more like the patients with low-risk disease (better prognosis),
we may be able to more effectively treat neuroblastoma. It has been found that lipid metabolism in particular
plays a role in differentiation in neuroblastoma. PIM1 is a kinase that has been shown to play a role in
neuroblastoma differentiation as well; blocking PIM1 promotes differentiation. How this occurs is unknown, but
PIM kinases play a role in lipid metabolism in non-cancer cells.
 Therefore, the goal of this project is twofold: 1) to determine the aspects of lipid metabolism affected by
PIM1 and which of these regulates differentiation in neuroblastoma, and 2) to define the lipidomics landscape in
neuroblastoma cancer stem cells to determine vulnerabilities in this subpopulation of cells responsible for relapse
and recurrence. The findings hold promise for better understanding lipid metabolism in neuroblastoma in order
to determine potential novel therapeutics to target high-risk neuroblastoma."

Alterations of a microtubule-binding protein tau are one of hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with
progressive memory loss being one of its major symptoms. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein, which
stabilizes microtubules. Tau is key facilitator of neuronal transport, mediated by microtubules, and regulation of
the microtubule cytoskeleton and microtubule-mediated transport is implicated in AD. A disruption of the
microtubule network, which might be caused by Tau loss of function, is observed in AD, contributing to memory
loss, but it is not clear what is the role of microtubule stability/instability and microtubule-mediated neuronal
transport. Activity-dependent changes, including dynamic rearrangement of microtubules and strengthening of
synaptic connections, are important for memory formation. Here we propose to examine how microtubule
stability/instability are affected in mice modeling some of the AD mechanisms. We and others showed that
activity-dependent changes in microtubule stability are critical for synapse function and memory and are
disrupted in normal aging. We will focus on the role of a phospho-protein stathmin, which function to bind
tubulin, disassemble microtubules and regulate microtubule dynamics is dependent on its phosphorylation. We
found that stathmin regulates memory consolidation: changes in the microtubule-destabilizing activity of
stathmin cause rapid biphasic shifts in microtubule stability in the hippocampus synapses following learning.
Moreover, stathmin mutations disrupt learning-dependent biphasic changes in microtubule stability, synaptic
localization of GluA2 subunit of AMPARs, synaptic plasticity and memory. We will examine whether stathmin-
dependent and microtubule-mediated changes in GluA2 synaptic localization improve or worsen memory
deficits in a tau-related AD model. Overall, our work will characterize a role in memory in an AD model for a
novel activity-dependent signaling pathway where stathmin-microtubule interactions regulate microtubule-
mediated GluA2 synaptic localization. We will study how stathmin may affect a tau-related AD model, Tau
P301S (PS19) mice. We previously showed that stathmin deletion makes microtubules hyperstable and Stat4A
makes microtubules unstable. Our hypothesis is that activity-dependent stathmin-microtubule interactions at
the synapse regulate microtubule stability, GluA2 localization and memory in a Tau mouse model of
Alzheimer’s disease. In Aim 1 we will study activity-dependent changes in synaptic microtubules and GluA2 in
Tau P301S (PS19) mice with loss-of-function or gain-of-function stathmin mutants. In Aim 2, we will study the
effects of the stathmin mutants on synaptic plasticity and memory in Tau P301S (PS19) mice. These
experiments will examine whether changes in microtubule stability/instability affect memory in PS19 mice and
suggest possible microtubule involvement in the development of AD memory deficits. Positive outcomes from
these studies are expected to improve our understanding of pathobiology of AD and discovery of new
therapeutic targets."

strategic initiative and collaborates with key faculty to support innovative translational research for
next generation clinical trials within the NCI’s National Clinical Trials Network.
Since 1974, UWCCC faculty have functioned as leaders in the development of the NCI cancer
cooperative group program; ?rst within ECOG and then with RTOG, ACOSOG and GOG in the early
2000s. As the NCI and its NCTN transitioned to a centralized infrastructure in 2014, the UWCCC
designed a LAPS team of collaborative principal investigators by combining the existing broad
scienti?c leadership from three of the primary cooperative groups (ECOG/ACRIN, NRG and
ALLIANCE). This multi-disciplinary approach with leaders from Surgical, Medical, Radiation and
Gynecologic Oncology, facilitated an innovative governance structure to provide leadership and

American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIANs) experience disproportionately high rates of lifetime substance
use disorder with peak past-year prevalence rates at 16 years of age. AIAN adolescents ages 17 and younger
have a higher prevalence and earlier initiation of drug and alcohol use compared with all other ethnic/racial
groups in the US. Compared to other ethnic/racial groups, AIAN youth have the highest self-reported
depression rates, and in 2014, suicide was the second leading cause of death for AIANs between the ages 10
and 34 years of age. These data demonstrate the need for early intervention to prevent substance use in AIAN
adolescents. Cultural connectedness has been identified as a protective factor against substance use and
depression for AIAN youth while promoting positive self-esteem and healthy identity formation. Culturally-
grounded after-school programs (ASPs) use cultural values and practices as a basis for health promotion and
disease prevention, a form of AIAN prevention. Culturally-grounded program differ from other cultural programs
(culturally-based or culturally-adapted) because the development is guided or led by the local community, for
the local community and are rooted in specific social and cultural contexts. This study builds on a 6-year
partnership with ASPs serving AI adolescents to assess the impact of a 13-session culturally-grounded
intervention, called Native Spirit (NS). NS is an ASP that is led by traditional knowledge holders with each
session focusing on a community-specific cultural value and activity. NS aims to decrease and prevent
substance use by enhancing protective factors, including strengthening cultural identity, self-esteem, and
resilience. The goals of the proposed (R00) study are to: 1) strengthen self-esteem, resilience, and cultural
identity, and 2) attenuate substance use among AI youth (ages 12-17) through participation in NS. This study
will use a mixed methods waitlist control design to evaluate the impact of participation in the NS program. The
study will measure changes to participant self-esteem, cultural identity, resilience, and substance use with a
self-report survey at three timepoints and semi-structured interviews. This study provides an innovative
connection between cultural engagement and substance use prevention for AI adolescents and also highlights
unique opportunities for health promotion with collaborations with ASPs that serve AI communities. Through
the MOSAIC K99/R00, I will gain training in qualitative and quantitative analysis, culturally-appropriate
measurement of adolescent substance use, and the development and implementation of prevention
interventions while transitioning to an independent investigator in a tenure-track faculty position. The resulting
R00 phase research aligns with NIDA Strategic Goal 2 to “develop new and improved strategies to prevent
drug use and its consequences” with AI communities in the Southwest."
10999773,"Project Abstract
Cryptococcus species are environmental fungi that cause disease primarily in immunocompromised populations,
including a deadly cryptococcal meningitis that contributes to 15% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths. When inhaled
into the lungs, these fungi must adapt rapidly to survive a variety of stresses encountered in the human host,
including high temperature stress, changes in pH and oxidative stress. In cases of persistent disease,
Cryptococcus must evade host immune defenses and resist antifungal drug treatment. Adaptive genomic
changes in Cryptococcus known to enhance virulence or cause drug resistance during infection include base
substitutions, small insertions/deletions and aneuploidy. Transposable elements (TEs) are small, mobile DNA
elements present in the genomes of most eukaryotic organisms that are capable of causing significant genomic
changes and phenotypic variation. The potential role of TEs in Cryptococcus and other pathogenic fungal species
(Candida and Aspergillus) in contributing to fungal pathogenesis or drug resistance is largely unexplored. We
recently identified TE mobilization in Cryptococcus deneoformans as a significant cause of mutation in a murine
model of infection. Mutations by TEs in reporter genes for drug resistance were dramatically elevated at high
temperature (37° host-relevant temperature) in vitro, suggesting that heat stress stimulates TE mobility in the
cryptococcal genome. Additionally, we demonstrated TE insertion as a cause of drug resistance to clinical
antifungal agents rapamycin/FK506 and 5-fluorocytosine in vitro. Our study was the first to identify TE
mobilization as a cause of mutation during infection in a pathogenic fungus. In addition, TE mutagenesis in
response to heat stress had not been described previously in any model yeast species. Remarkably, the heat-
responsive TEs identified in C. deneoformans include both DNA transposons and retrotransposons, each with
distinct modes of mobilization and preferred sites of genomic integration. In the proposed research, we seek to
1) determine whether heat stress is the primary cause of increased TE mobilization during C. deneoformans
infection, 2) identify regulators of heat stress-induced TE mutagenesis in C. deneoformans, and 3) determine
whether TEs mobilize in other cryptococcal species (C. neoformans or C. gattii) in vitro or during host infection.
Elucidating the mechanisms of adaptive change that enhance fungal pathogenesis or enable drug resistance is
critical in developing and maintaining effective antifungal treatments. This study will further our understanding of
the types of stress-induced mutations that arise during cryptococcal infection that may contribute to disease
persistence and variations in clinical outcomes for patients. In addition, our study will highlight a set of
experimental approaches, infection models and sequencing tools that can be used to identify and quantitate
genetic mutations (TE and non-TE) in a broad range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species."

Observational learning is a type of social learning and a fundamental cognitive behavior in humans and social
animals. How neural circuits in the brain enable this type of learning is not understood. Utilizing an observational
spatial working memory task, where an observer rat learns to first observe the spatial trajectory of a demonstrator
rat and then run the trajectory itself for rewards, this project studies the behavioral and neural circuit processes
underlying reward-directed observational learning. We will focus on a neural circuit hypothesis that interactions
between the hippocampus (HP) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) acquire a vicarious reward signal during
observation and maintain a plan afterward for future spatial trajectories. By conducting behavioral testing,
simultaneous high-density tetrode recording, and closed-loop electrical and optogenetic manipulations in
animals performing the observational spatial working memory task, we will determine key behavioral factors
involved, underlying neural activity patterns and their interactions in HP and ACC, and how behavioral
performances are altered by time- and activity-specific disruptions of HP or ACC neurons. The outcomes of this
study will significantly advance our understanding of behavioral and neural mechanisms in observational learning.
The neural circuit knowledge produced and the manipulations tested in this project may generate novel insights
into how observational leaning is impaired in psychiatric disorders."
10997240,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital malformations arising from errors during fetal development are the leading cause of infant
death in the United States. Physiologic development relies on an orchestration of gene regulatory mechanisms.
These mechanisms instruct pluripotent cells in the embryo to specify into hundreds of differentiated identities in
the right place at the right time. Thus, to develop therapeutic strategies against developmental diseases, there
is a critical need to understand the gene regulation instructing cell fate. Both transcriptional and posttranscriptional
regulation are known to instruct DNA and RNA processing of genes important in cell fate
specification. Yet, a growing area of study has revealed that these regulatory mechanisms can interact to allow
feedback, competition, or cooperativity between chromatin and RNA functions. However, a significant gap in
knowledge is how this interplay contributes to human cell fate control. Preliminary data indicate that ILF2-ILF3,
a heterodimeric, dual DNA- and RNA- binding protein, is critical for specifying human embryonic cell fates by
regulating splicing of key chromatin regulators. This proposal aims to define the interplay between DNA and RNA
regulation as a novel mechanism of human cell fate control. The following aims are designed to test the
hypothesis that ILF2-ILF3 is a critical determinant of human cell identities through regulation of both
chromatin and RNA. Aim 1 will suppress ILF2-ILF3 expression in two systems of differentiation of human
pluripotent stem cells to test the hypothesis that ILF2-ILF3 is required for early cell fate transitions. Aim 2 will
identify direct chromatin, RNA, and protein binding partners of ILF2-ILF3, and investigate downstream effectors,
to test the hypothesis that ILF2-ILF3 regulates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes to specify
cell fate. The long-term obiectives of this project are to determine a new mechanism driving human
development at the molecular and cellular levels and advance strategies to prevent congenital diseases.

The overarching goal of the research presented in this application is to reveal the fundamental and conserved
genetic and epigenetic programs that encode and transmit a memory of alcohol exposure for several
generations. In mammals, in utero ethanol exposure is associated with an array of well-characterized
neurobehavioral issues. However, there is mounting evidence in a variety of model organisms that some adverse
neurological features are also detectable in the third generation following exposure, indicating a
transgenerational effect. Alcohol also has a clear epigenetic impact and directly contributes to the modification
of the epigenome. Nevertheless, it is unclear how the memory of ethanol exposure persists in the nervous system
across generations. Here, I combine the tractability and conservation of the model system Caenorhabditis
elegans with state-of-the-art epigenomic analyses, classical genetics, and behavioral approaches to shed light
on the mechanisms of epigenetic memory of alcohol exposure and its transgenerational behavioral effects. My
preliminary data shows that ethanol exposure (1) leads to increased histone acetylation in directly exposed
animals; and that (2) ethanol seeking behavior is increased until at least the third generation, paralleling the
increased alcohol consumption observed in rodent models and humans. Whether these observations are
connected, and ethanol-mediated acetylation is directly responsible for the altered transgenerational impact on
behavior is unknown. The specific altered acetylation marks and their distribution across the neuronal genome
are also unknown. Thus, the driving hypothesis of this project is that neuronal histone hyperacetylation
persists across generations to drive ethanol-induced transgenerational behavioral effects. In Aim 1, I will
use a histone multiplex assay, immunofluorescence, and CUT&RUN sequencing of FACS-sorted neuronal nuclei
to identify the neuronal epigenetic changes accompanying exposure to ethanol. In Aim 2, I will pharmacologically
inhibit and perform neuron subtype-specific RNA interference of histone acetyltransferases and demethylases
to determine the role of neuronal histone acetylation in ethanol’s transgenerational behavioral effects.
This proposal has the potential to establish the impact of ethanol exposure on neuronal histone PTMs and their
role in transgenerational behavioral effects. By applying genetic, epigenetic, and pharmacological approaches
in a relevant and highly tractable organism, this proposed work will advance our knowledge of the epigenetic
memory of alcohol exposure and its transgenerational behavioral effects. I will carry out these studies in Patrick
Allard’s lab at UCLA, a respected expert in environmental epigenetics, with support from co-sponsors Xia Yang,
an expert in epigenomics, and Kelly Huffman, an expert in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. The environment at
UCLA will also provide excellent intellectual, technical, and professional training. This will aid me in achieving
my career goal of running an independent research lab studying the neuroepigenetics of chemical exposures."

 In the United States, early-life adversity (ELA) is frequently reported and is strongly linked to later-life repercussions.
Research highlights a significant association between neuropsychiatric disorders and adverse or traumatic events during
early life, indicating ELA as a potential common root cause. This association has been identified as a precursor to various
neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, and addiction. These conditions are of considerable global
concern, as they not only diminish overall quality of life but also have adverse effects on societal functioning.
 A pivotal aspect of ELA involves stress and the processing of sensory signals during early stressful events. These signals
undergo decoding by cortical layers in the brain, subsequently being transmitted to midbrain regions responsible for
regulating behavioral responses. The dorsal striatum plays a central role in this process by processing cortical inputs and
establishing connections with key brain regions that influence behavioral adaptability. Our recent research has unveiled
functional impairments in corticostriatal synapses in adult mice following ELA. Specifically, we observed a decrease in
glutamate release from the anterior cingulate cortex to the dorsomedial striatum in male ELA mice, contrasting with an
increase in females. Furthermore, males exposed to ELA displayed behavioral inflexibility, while females exhibited no
impairments. This represents the first direct functional evidence of the impact of ELA on this brain circuit. The current
proposal will focus on this circuit and evaluate the potential mechanism underlying ELA.
 Previous findings revealed increased metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) expression after ELA, however, their
role in ELA-induced effects on corticostriatal synapses and behavioral adaptability remains unknown. Our pilot study
revealed that ELA disrupts mGluR5-mediated synaptic transmission (i.e., depolarization-induced suppression of excitation,
DSE). Based on our published and pilot work, our central hypothesis is that ELA elevates mGluR5 activity and expression,
disrupting dorsomedial striatum (DMS)-mediated functions. We aim to demonstrate this by investigating mGluR5's impact
on ELA-induced impairments and its potential rescue through mGluR5 inactivation. Understanding these ELA-induced
effects on corticostriatal synapses is crucial, as it sheds light on the potential development or progression of psychiatric
disorders. The contrast in glutamate release and behavioral responses between genders emphasizes the need to further study
this brain circuit to intervene effectively and mitigate the risk of psychiatric disorders. The proposed studies will address
critical gaps in understanding ELA-induced impairments, offering potential targets for treatment."
10997019,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most severe neuromuscular diseases, with a median life
expectancy of 22 years. DMD results from the absence of the protein dystrophin, reducing the ability of muscle
to respond to stresses imposed by force generation and resulting in significant contractile dysfunction. In human
patients with DMD, this manifests in progressive skeletal muscle weakness beginning around 3-5 years of age
and cardiomyopathy and respiratory insufficiency around age 25, leading to death. In the mdx mouse model of
DMD, the absence of dystrophin also results in rapid and robust deficits in contractility, particularly loss of force
with repetitive eccentric contractions (ECCs) in skeletal muscle. The mechanisms by which mdx mice undergo
ECC force loss, and those which result in broader contractile deficits of striated muscle, are poorly understood.
Preliminary data from the Ervasti lab implicates elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent
hyperoxidation of the thiol proteome in DMD pathophysiology. Moreover, supplementation with the
gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is reduced in mdx muscle, completely protects mdx extensor
digitorum longus (EDL) muscle from ECC force loss in vitro. The mechanisms by which H2S protects from ECC
force loss, and its contributions to contractility in general, are not well characterized in the context of dystrophin-
deficient muscular dystrophy. The studies I designed in my proposal will test the hypothesis that elevations in
H2S will increase the persulfidation of reactive thiol residues on cysteines of contractile proteins, thereby
preventing hyperoxidation and associated contractile dysfunction. The experiments proposed here will strive to
characterize the effect of chronic, systemic H2S supplementation on DMD pathophysiology in vivo (Aim 1) and
define the effects of low H2S levels on oxidative post-translational modifications in mdx contractile proteins (Aim
2). A more complete understanding of contractile dysfunction and protection from force loss in mdx muscle is
critical to generating more efficacious therapeutics.
In addition to the research proposal, the following documents include a comprehensive and rigorous set of
research and clinical training plans that will allow for the successful completion of my MD and PhD degrees and
will enhance my development into a productive physician-scientist, able to drive cutting-edge translational
research and clinical care for my patients."
10997022,"Erythropoiesis is a finely orchestrated process that involves generating a ~2.5 million red blood cells per
second to maintain homeostasis and prevent anemia. RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing is a highly regulated
and fundamental mechanism of transcriptional regulation, whereby transcription is initiated, but pauses 30-60
bp downstream of the transcription start site. Release of paused RNAPII into active elongation requires
phosphorylation of RNAPII and associated inhibitory factors by positive transcription elongation factor beta
(pTEFb). Our group has shown that regulation of RNAPII activity is an essential determinant of erythroid cell
function, with central roles in the regulation of gene expression and cell cycle progression. HEXIM1 is a key
regulator of pTEFb activity that can enforce pausing or facilitate pause release, depending on genomic context.
HEXIM1 is essential for erythropoiesis, and promotes erythroid proliferation and the expression of GATA1-target
genes. Despite its importance, fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which HEXIM1
regulates RNAPII activity and promotes erythroid gene expression. HEXIM1 is classically thought of as a
transcriptional repressor, which enforces RNAPII pausing by sequestering pTEFb in the 7SK complex. Data from
our group and others suggests the HEXIM1-pTEFb-7sk complex can be targeted to specific genes, where it is
available for “onsite” release of pTEFb, facilitating pause release. In Aim 1, we will address the hypothesis
that delivery of pTEFb to specific genes by HEXIM1 and the 7SK Complex is essential for both steady
state and stress erythropoiesis. RNAPII pausing is regulated by cell type- and maturation stage-specific
transcription factors and signaling pathways. Early erythropoiesis is comprised of the differentiation of multipotent
progenitors to erythroid progenitors, while terminal maturation consists of the maturation of proerythroblasts
through several intermediates into orthochromatic erythroblasts that ultimately enucleate. In contrast to terminally
maturing cells, erythroid progenitors have the ability to undergo self-renewal divisions, and to expand in response
to anemic stress. HEXIM1 is expressed in erythroid progenitors and upregulated in terminally maturing cells.
Other key regulators of pTEFb, including Bromodomain Protein 4 (BRD4), and the Mediator Complex are highly
expressed in erythroid progenitors and down regulated during terminal maturation. Erythroid progenitors also
have higher levels of RNAPII than terminally maturing cells. These data suggest that the transcriptional
environment of erythroid progenitors is distinct from that of terminally maturing cells. In Aim2, we will address
the hypothesis that RNAPII activity is regulated in a maturation stage-specific manner. The proposed
studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms that govern normal and perturbed erythropoiesis, and
have the potential to identify novel therapeutic targets for inherited and acquired anemias."
10983272,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT.
Substance use disorders affect millions of Americans, with substance use often beginning in adolescence.
There is a pressing need to identify targets for interventions that reduce substance use initiation and misuse,
especially for those at high risk. Our primary goal is to examine adolescent music engagement as a potential
protective factor for early substance use behaviors. Music engagement is promising because of its many
prosocial benefits, including for quality of life, social connectedness, and emotional competence. However,
existing studies have not evaluated whether associations between music engagement and substance use are
driven by correlated genetic or environmental influences versus direct causal effects. Beyond this, gene-by-
environment interactions (GxE) are highly relevant to both music engagement and substance use, and music
engagement may be especially protective for individuals at high genetic or environmental risk for substance
use. Establishing these associations and understanding whether they are specific to music engagement and/or
may be observed for other activities (e.g., art, sports engagement) will inform translational and intervention
efforts aimed at preventing or reducing adolescent substance use before problematic use.
We will conduct secondary data analyses of large longitudinal twin/family studies with multiple waves of
assessment of music engagement, substance use, and genotyping on most subjects. Datasets include the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD) and the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan
Behavioral Development and Cognitive Aging (CATSLife). Analyses include multiple twin/family and genomic
approaches that inform whether associations are due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and causal
effects (e.g., Mendelian Randomization Direction of Causation, Aim 1a), longitudinal analyses examining
whether music engagement predicts later substance use behaviors (Aim 1b), and a detailed comparison of
music engagement with other activities (Aim 1c). We will also test competing theoretical models of GxE
(diathesis stress versus differential susceptibility) using polygenic scores (Aim 2a), environmental risk variables
(e.g., SES, peer use, Aim 2b), and socio-demographic measures (Aim 2c). The study team is well-versed in
longitudinal structural equation modeling approaches to study substance use and music engagement, including
polygenic score and twin/family approaches leveraged here (and combinations of both).
The research supported by this R01 award will be critical for understanding how music engagement relates to
adolescent substance use initiation and progression, and to quantify the nature of these associations. It will lay
groundwork for music intervention studies targeting individuals at highest risk for substance use problems
(e.g., polygenic scores, environmental risk factors). This work responds directly to NIDA’s mission to identify
factors leading to the prevention of substance use disorder and is directly relevant to the Music and Health
initiative’s goal to examine how music engagement relates to important health traits such as substance use."
10983080,"This application is a competitive renewal of the Cleveland site and subsites of the Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN). The term non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH have now been suggested by various academic and clinical societies to be replaced with the terms metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). However, given the continued widespread use of the terms, for this application, we will refer to these diseases as NAFLD/NASH. This renewal addresses the major goals of the program announcement (RFA 23-515) that include completion of the ongoing studies and analyze the existing datasets. The primary goal of the NASH CRN is to address the key unmet needs in the field that include: Improvement of our understanding of the pathogenesis and natural course of the disease; Development of non-invasive biomarkers to predict severity and progression of the disease; and Identify safe and effective therapies. Towards these goals, in this competitive renewal we will complete the enrollment, execution and analyses of the prospective database of well characterized adults and children with NAFLD/NASH. In addition, our robust and productive interaction with the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital has allowed us to enroll and follow children with NAFLD. Given the lack of licensed/approved treatments for NASH, and the high public health significance, the ongoing vitamin E dosing study (VEDS) is a randomized, double masked clinical trial to identify the lowest effective dose of vitamin E using non-invasive outcome measures. We will also utilize the available clinical data, biosamples, histological, and imaging data to develop and validate the underlying mechanisms and potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and staging of NASH. The Cleveland site has consistently been the highest enrolling site with exceptionally high quality data accumulation since inception in both the database (cohort) and randomized clinical trials. In addition to the primary aims of execution, analyses, and publication of the data, we will also plan for an orderly “closeout” of the NASH CRN in close conjunction with the Data Coordinating Center and the other clinical sites. We remain the highest enrolling site in the VEDS trial and will continue with the ongoing studies with the aim of supporting the entire network in order to achieve completion in the limited time frame. The VEDS trial will lay the foundation for future pivotal studies for NASH. Our recruitment and retention in both the database and VEDS trial have exceeded targets that will help with the timely completion of the studies. Additional important components include informing patients of the results of VEDS as well as a phased transition of patients in the database to clinical care only with the proviso that future studies on NAFLD/NASH may provide additional opportunities for participation in clinical studies. We will use existing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomics data to perform integrated multiomics analyses for limited scope analyses to generate preliminary data for future funding opportunities."
10985536,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 T2* mapping and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are vital for in vivo iron quantification. They can
track the subtle changes in tissue compositions during early brain development; they can provide valuable
characteristics of lesions in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) for structural, pathological, and dynamic information. T2* and
QSM are commonly estimated using multi-echo gradient echo (GRE), which suffers from long scan time (5-10
minutes) and sensitivity to motion and B0 perturbations, significantly limiting its clinical accessibility and impeding
its potential for fine tissue characterization towards submillimeter resolution.
 This project aims to develop and validate a rapid, distortion- and blurring-free, and motion- and B0-robust
technique for submillimeter-resolution T2* and QSM quantification, and translate it to applications on challenging
populations, including infants and MS patients, demonstrating its potential for wide neuroscientific and clinical
applications. The goal is fulfilled through three Specific Aims:
 In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize a highly efficient spherical-coverage echo-planar time-resolved
imaging (sEPTI) framework for whole-brain distortion- and blurring-free T2* and QSM quantification. We will
leverage a subspace-based unrolled deep-learning network for SNR-boosting reconstruction to achieve a 4x
reduction in scan time on top of the already-fast state-of-the-art EPTI techniques.
 In Aim 2, we will develop a 3.5-ms multi-channel SPINS-trajectory navigator and combine it with the sEPTI
technique as nasEPTI to achieve accurate motion and δB! estimation per TR with 70 ms latency. A supervised
deep learning network will be developed to achieve fast and accurate estimation of motion and δB! in <5ms.
Taken together, we will develop a synergistic per-TR prospective motion correction and retrospective B0
correction pipeline based on the rapid deep learning inference to accomplish a robust nasEPTI technique for
artifact-minimized T2* weighted images, and T2* and QSM quantification.
 In Aim 3, nasEPTI will first be validated on 20 motion-prone infant subjects on 3-Tesla scanners with 0.7mm3
isotropic resolution and 1-minute scan time to demonstrate its robustness to motion and B0 perturbations. In
parallel, this technique will be translated to 7-Tesla systems for a protocol of 0.35 mm isotropic resolution and 6-
minute scan time. Finally, we will validate the 7T nasEPTI protocol on clinically suspected MS patients with
cortical lesions, where T2* and QSM provide critical pathological information about the lesions.
 The expected outcome is that the proposed techniques achieve distortion- and blurring-free, motion- and
B0-robust high-resolution T2* and QSM quantification. They are consistent with conventional multi-echo GRE in
terms of T2* and QSM values, but provide enhanced image quality with significantly reduced artifacts. This will
enable mesoscale iron characterization within a scientifically and clinically feasible time, facilitating its access to
general populations, including motion-prone pediatric and geriatric groups."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of Non-hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) with limited treatment
options in the relapsed or refractory (r/r) setting. This is true in humans and dogs. Immunotherapy with
checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have demonstrated durable efficacy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, but poor efficacy for
NHL. There is an unmet clinical understand mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and develop therapeutic
approaches to improve clinical response for patients with advanced NHL and other cancers. DLBCL in
companion dogs (cDLBCL) is treated with similar chemotherapy protocols and has a similarly poor prognosis in
the r/r setting as human DLBCL. While genomic comparison shows limited overlap of the mutational landscape
in canine and human DLBCLs, preliminary comparison of the tumor microenvironment (TME) shows
conservation of stromal and immune compartments between the two species. Thus, cDLBLCL provide
opportunities to prospectively investigate clinical toxicities and mechanisms of clinical response in a clinically
realistic setting that recapitulates the pathology, heterogeneity, and TME of human cancers.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a rapidly replicating, robustly immunogenic oncolytic virus (OV) platform that
has been engineered for safe systemic therapy of disseminated cancer. Intravenous (IV) VSV therapy was
shown preclinically in murine tumor models to rapidly infect, spread within, and kill tumor cells, and induce robust
intratumoral immune infiltration, sensitizing tumors to checkpoint blockade. ONIx (oncoimmunology accelerator)
is a novel, dual targeted CPI that targets both innate and adaptive mechanisms of tumor immune suppression
to enhance antitumor immune responses mediated by macrophages and T-cells. We hypothesize that
oncolytic VSV and ONIx will have complementary mechanisms of action (MOA), working in concert to kill
tumor cells by direct viral lysis as well as phagocytosis, increase availability of tumor associated antigens (TAAs),
promote antigen presentation and activate anti-tumor T-cell responses, to enhance immune mediated tumor
killing and improve clinical responses in r/r DLBCL. Our proposal merges the expertise and resources of
leading institutions in OV development (Mayo Clinic), comparative oncology (University of Minnesota), and
lymphoma immunotherapy (Mayo Lymphoma SPORE) to perform a veterinary trial and correlative studies to
evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of this novel combination therapy in r/r cDLBCL. The proposed
studies will yield valuable insights into how an IV administered OV can infect heterogeneous DLBCL tumors and
agitate the TME; if this disruption enhances the ability of CPIs (and potentially other immunotherapies) to activate
immune mediated tumor killing; and how the tumor architecture differs in the context of clinical response versus
non-response. The heterogeneity inherent in naturally occurring cDLBCL will inform the clinical utility of this
combination therapy, define MOA, and identify biomarkers that can be explored clinically in human DLBCL."
10993314,"CNS cancers account for 26% of pediatric cancers and are the leading cause of cancer deaths and morbidity.
Medulloblastoma, the most common CNS cancer in children, is typically treated with high doses of external
beam radiation therapy (xRT) and surgery. However, xRT induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in
cancerous as well as normal neural cells and can cause severe neurocognitive impairments, especially in the
youngest children. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate the causes of xRT-induced neurotoxicity to aid
in the development of potential neuroprotective agents that will improve quality of life for childhood CNS cancer
survivors. However, it is currently unclear which cells in the developing brain are most vulnerable to loss or
dysfunction in response to xRT at different stages of differentiation to potentially drive neurocognitive
impairment. The candidate will pursue this gap in our knowledge and contribute to the goals of the parent grant
by using well-established in vitro neural cell differentiation models originating both from humans and mice to
elucidate how apoptosis is regulated during cellular differentiation. Furthermore, these models will be used to
test neural cell sensitivity to ionizing radiation and elucidate the mechanisms involved. The candidate will gain
hands-on experience and mastery of advanced molecular biology techniques while also building technical
knowledge, scientific rigor and scientific communication skills. With the support of this supplement, we will
incorporate the student’s background in neurodevelopment into our study of apoptosis regulation in the
developing brain and its causative role in xRT-induced neurocognitive impairment. Her proposed work not only
aligns well with the objectives of the original R37 award but also has the potential to uncover novel
mechanisms linking cellular differentiation with apoptosis suppression. Furthermore, the study will enable the
candidate to develop the knowledge and skills necessary for a successful transition to an independent career
as a molecular biologist specializing in radiation biology, toxicology, cancer biology and neurodevelopment."
10991958,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Population-wide genomic screening (PGS) for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome, Lynch
Syndrome, and Familial Hypercholesterolemia offers great promise in identifying the 1-2% of the population that
unknowingly carries a pathogenic variant that puts them at elevated risk for serious, yet preventable disease.
Rapidly decreasing sequencing costs, endorsement of PGS by national bodies, and attention to precision
medicine applications have rapidly accelerated the spread of PGS programs. To date, no clear guidelines or
implementation strategies exist to support the rapid growth of PGS. Contextual factors, including program-level
procedures, organizational structure, and characteristics of the patient population, influence implementation of
these large-scale PGS initiatives. To help facilitate growth of PGS programs and enhance recruitment and
retention of representative populations into genomic initiatives, we propose to identify best practices for PGS
implementation and develop and test a freely available, online multicomponent implementation guide (FOCUS
toolkit). This project will establish a gold standard approach for equitably integrating PGS and offer the field
generalizable methods and knowledge about PGS implementation. Specifically, using a stakeholder-engaged
Implementation Mapping approach we will: 1) conduct a qualitative needs assessment among ten PGS programs
(FOCUS design sites) at various implementation stages (emerging, implementing, sustaining) guided by the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research integrated with constructs from the Health Equity
Implementation Framework, 2) develop and produce the FOCUS toolkit consisting of equity-focused
implementation strategies, materials, and protocols, and 3) evaluate the impact of the FOCUS toolkit on Reach,
Effectiveness, Implementation, Adoption, Maintenance and health equity outcomes for PGS in 12 PGS sites
(FOCUS test sites) with diverse populations and settings using a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design.
All aspects of this project will be conducted by an exceptional investigative team comprised of individuals from
diverse backgrounds and across career stages and supported by a ten-person Implementation Mapping Advisory
Panel consisting of representatives from public health and regulatory agencies, communities and patient groups,
and clinical stakeholders. Efforts are further bolstered by our Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives, which
advances the scientific and technical merit of our project through inclusivity and diverse perspectives among our
team, the sites where research is conducted, and those who participate in the research. These findings will: 1)
provide a standardized approach and evaluation framework for programs seeking to strategically implement and
expand population-based approaches for identifying individuals and families at high risk of serious, yet
preventable disease, 2) provide generalizable methods and knowledge about PGS, and 3) support efforts to
bring the promise of precision health to all."
10984088,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to understand how cellular membrane trafficking machinery controls the packaging
and release of extracellular vesicle (EV) cargoes from synapses in vivo. EVs are small membrane-bound
vesicles released by numerous cell types, including neurons, carrying cargoes critical for signaling and
disease. However, we understand very little about how EV cargo traffic is spatially and temporally regulated
within the polarized and complex morphology of neurons. We have developed tools to track and manipulate EV
traffic at Drosophila presynaptic terminals in vivo, and discovered that flux of cargoes through a plasma
membrane-recycling endosome route determines whether they are locally sorted for packaging and release in
EVs, rather than depleted from synapses by retrograde transport. Recycling endosomes have primarily been
studied in non-neuronal cells, and very little is known about their lifetime, functions, or dynamics at presynaptic
terminals. We do know that recycling endosomes play critical roles in signaling, neuronal morphogenesis, EV
traffic, and synaptic transmission. Understanding and therapeutically intervening in these important processes
will require a deeper knowledge of the mechanisms of neuronal recycling endosome function. In this proposal,
we will elucidate the mechanisms of synaptic EV cargo and recycling endosome traffic in vivo. To achieve
these goals, we will use Drosophila genetics, biochemistry, high-resolution microscopy, and live cell imaging.
1) We will determine the functions, dynamics, and regulation of different types of synaptic recycling
endosomes. To this end, we will develop new tools and approaches to define and control functionally distinct
recycling compartments at synapses. Using these tools, we will test novel mechanistic hypotheses for how
membrane traffic machinery sorts cargoes at synaptic recycling compartments. 2) We will determine how EV
cargo traffic depends on distinct modes of synaptic endocytosis: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which operates
under low neuronal activity and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis, which operates during intense neuronal
activity. These experiments will ascertain if EV fate is determined by different modes of internalization, how
recycling endosomes contribute to these functions, and provide new mechanisms to link activity, endosomal
traffic, and EV release. Given the conserved nature of synaptic membrane trafficking machinery, our findings
and tools will lay the foundation for new insights into EV traffic in many aspects of nervous system function,
including in human neurological disease."
10981523,"Summary
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is an aggressive vascular disease that carries a significant human death toll.
The inflammatory AAA microenvironment mainly driven by aortic macrophages (MØ) enables AAA progression
by promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation leading to a progressive dilatation of the aortic wall which
will eventually rupture and cause death. While our findings in the previous funding cycle have elaborated on the
effector roles of MØ within the AAA mayhem, the upstream mechanisms derived from the expanding AAA that
subsequently induce MØ reprograming remain poorly defined. Our rationale is based on compelling new
preliminary results using single-cell RNA sequencing and functional studies of human and mice AAA that
demonstrate that the homo-dimeric activation of cadherin11 (Cdh11) with itself amplifies aortic MØ inflammatory
functions by promoting the discharge of proteolytic factors in the AAA sac. The activation of Cdh11 expressed
by fibroblasts triggers the expression of Csf1 via YapTaz/Tead1 that acts on MØ via its receptor Csf1r. We show
that inhibition of Cdh11 with a novel small molecule inhibitor prevents mice from developing AAA by tempering
the MØ inflammatory and proteolytic responses ensuing the inhibition of ECM degradation. We observed that
Cdh11 controls the level of membrane-bound and secreted variants of Csf1 (mCsf1, sCsf1) which could
supervise the intensity of MØ inflammatory responses at distinct sites within the AAA sac. We postulate that
within the expanding AAA sac, local endotensions activate fibroblast-Cdh11 thereon fostering the local secretion
of Csf1 and its variants through YapTaz/Tead1 dependent pathways. This fuels the amplification of deleterious
MØ responsescreatingacontinuumthatsustainsECMdegradationandpromoteAAAdevelopmentandrupture.
We will concert with experts in the fields of Cdh11 and Csf1 to address our hypothesis in 3 specific aims. In aim
1, we will delineate the impact of conditionally deleting Csf1 in Cdh11 fibroblasts in AAA and study the effects
on MØ phenotype and activation. Transcriptome and epitope mapping will provide new mechanistic insights
imposed by Cdh11 in AAA. In aim 2, we will define whether Cdh11 inhibition can regulate MØ proliferation,
clonality and plasticity in AAA by using sophisticated MØ conditional mice (Confetti, Fucci). In aim 3, we will
interrogate the mechanisms underlying the mechanical activation of Cdh11 and test the role of YapTaz/Tead1
in regulating Csf1 and its variants in in vitro approaches. The distinct role of mCsf1 and sCsf1 and their impact
on MØ activation will be directly tested in AAA using transgenic mice overexpressing these isoforms. Spatial
transcriptomic analysis of human AAA will elucidate the cartography of Cdh11/MØ interactions and their impact
on neighboring cell clusters in AAA. This proposed research is provocative and innovative as the role of Cdh11
in AAA is undefined. The use of clinical samples will provide solid pathways relevant to clinical AAA pathology.
The completion of this study will yield new insights into unexplored inflammatory pathways that drive AAA and
test the efficacy of reversing these pathological traits, urgently needed to curb AAA."
10982050,"Project Summary. Natural products from non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, polyketide synthases, and their
hybrid pathways serve as therapeutics for infectious diseases, immunosuppression, anti-inflammatory
regulation, antifungal and antiparasitic applications. Given their complexity and robustness, these metabolic
pathways are excellent starting points for molecular design and production, particularly given the promise of
synthetic biology for biomanufacturing new molecular entities. However, we do not fully understand the
mechanics and organization that regulates these multi-modular and multi-domain catalytic machines. Using both
model systems and clinically relevant biosynthetic pathways, our team will explore the use of peptidyl carrier
protein (PCP) crosslinking enabled through recently developed chemical biology methods. We will focus on
elucidating structural information about protein-protein interactions between PCPs and ketosynthase,
condensation, and thioesterase catalytic domains to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and structural
requirements that guide biosynthesis. Using in silico molecular modeling, we will apply these findings toward the
in vitro evolution of new PCP-enzyme arrangements capable of catalyzing the biosynthesis of novel molecules.
Our team combines chemical biological probe development with NMR, X-ray crystallographic and single particle
cryo-EM structural biology to develop a computationally tested understanding of the protein-protein interfaces
and mechanisms that guide substrate processivity within carrier protein dependent biosynthesis."
10980982,"This proposal investigates mechanisms that combine T2D (type 2 diabetes) with NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease), which progress during chronic hepatic IR (insulin resistance) to life-threatening NASH (non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis). Several studies argue that selective hepatic IR is required to integrate T2D with
NAFLD/NASH. Regardless, we find that complete hepatic IR exacerbates NAFLD/NASH and T2D in mice fed
the western GAN diet—which models common sugar-sweetened food and beverages associated with T2D and
NAFLD/NASH in people. We model complete hepatic IR with ‘LDKO’ mice that lack hepatic Irs1 (insulin
receptor substrate 1) and Irs2, which activates FoxO1 mediated transcription to induce hepatic Fst (follistatin)
expression and secretion. Circulating hepatic Fst causes WAT (white adipose tissue) IR and uncontrolled
lipolysis in LDKO mice. Our human data show that FST is elevated in NAFLD patients and stimulates lipolysis
in human adipocytes in vitro. Interestingly, phenotypic clustering identifies an LDKO-like subset of patients with
higher liver fat and circulating FST, WAT IR, and reduced lipid storage in gluteal-femoral fat. Our proposal
investigates whether hepatic FoxO1 and Fst accelerate progression of NAFLD to NASH during hepatic IR. We
use mouse genetics to determine whether inactivation of FoxO1 or Fst in LDKO mice fed the GAN diet can
attenuate both NAFLD/NASH trajectory and liver inflammatory gene expression to identify pathways causing
NAFLD/NASH during hepatic IR. Re-esterification of circulating fatty acids with hepatic Gro3P (glycerol-3-
phosphate)—a fructose metabolite—is a major source of hepatic triacylglycerol in NAFLD patients. We use a
simpler high-fructose diet (HFruD) to investigate whether FoxO1 and/or Fst establish NAFLD from hepatic
fructose metabolism during complete or selective hepatic IR. To understand whether fructose accelerates
NAFLD/NASH during hepatic IR through re-esterification of circulating fatty acid, we investigate LDKO mice fed
the HFruD after deletion of hepatic FoxO1 or Fst—or deletion of Khk (Ketohexokinase) to prevent hepatic
fructose metabolism. We feed mice [13C]fructose and use LC-MS to determine the incorporation of fructose
metabolites into the glycerol or fatty acid moieties of liver or circulating triacylglycerol. In humans and mice,
NAFLD might arise from ‘selective insulin resistance’—owing to uncontrolled hepatic glucose output in
conjunction with some insulin-stimulated lipogenesis; however, we posit that selective hepatic IR might have
the opposite effect and attenuate NAFLD/NASH owing to some inhibition of FoxO1 and Fst. Since chronic
nutrient excess suppresses hepatic Irs2, we investigate GAN diet-induced NAFLD/NASH and T2D in mice
lacking hepatic Irs2 (LKO2 mice) or Irs1 (LKO1 mice), as well as our novel Irs2tg transgenic mice with durable
Irs2 expression in hepatocytes of Cntr or LDKO mice. Completion of our proposal can impact human health by
identifying systemic and hepatic metabolic regulatory mechanisms by which hepatic IR integrates T2D with
NAFLD/NASH."

In pediatric epilepsy patients with drug-resistant seizures, surgical resection is the most effective treatment
option. The goal of resective surgery is to maximize removal of epileptic foci to attain seizure-freedom while
minimizing damage to surrounding brain regions to avoid permanent post-surgical functional loss. Functional
MRI enables rapid and non-invasive pre-surgical mapping of language, motor skills and other critical functional
brain regions with high spatial resolution. However, excessive head motion presents a major limitation for
acquiring high-quality fMRI in pediatric patients with focal brain lesions, who usually have difficulty remaining
still for long fMRI scan durations. Unfortunately, current retrospective and prospective approaches cannot
adequately compensate for the complex effects of motion in fMRI. As echo planar imaging (EPI) is highly
susceptible to local magnetic field variations, motion-induced geometric distortions and blood oxygenation
level-dependent (BOLD) contrast changes can lead to potentially significant mislocalization of activation
regions, even with accurate head motion tracking. The overarching goal of the research proposed under this
application to the NIH is to dramatically improve the quality of fMRI for pre-surgical mapping in pediatric
epilepsy patients. We are proposing a solution based on 3D EPI, which is more robust to spin history artifacts
and has higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to conventional 2D EPI, combined with real-time motion
and field compensation. In particular, we will use ultra-fast free induction decay (FID) navigators, which can be
embedded in each shot of the 3D EPI acquisition without affecting BOLD contrast or reducing acquisition
efficiency. These navigator measurements will be used to produce accurate motion and field estimates that
can be used to update the imaging volume and magnetic field in real time. We hypothesize that this improved
functional MRI acquisition strategy will produce technically useful activation maps in pediatric epilepsy patients
evaluated for a resection surgery at a higher rate than previously thought possible. To achieve these ambitious
goals, we will undertake the following specific aims: 1) develop and evaluate a novel technology using FID
navigators to measure head motion and magnetic field fluctuations in multi-shot 3D EPI; 2) develop and
evaluate prospective motion correction and dynamic shimming utilizing real-time motion and field
measurements; 3) apply and evaluate motion and distortion compensation in fMRI of pediatric epilepsy surgery
candidates. If successful, our project will facilitate widespread clinical adaptation of fMRI for pre-surgical
mapping in epilepsy, and enable high resolution fMRI for research studies in incompliant patient populations."

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy caused by the oncoprotein
BCRABL1. Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can help CML patients achieve molecular remission, they
cannot be fully cured because the leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are still present in the body. This application aims
to study a novel actionable mechanism that controls self-renewal and survival in LSCs with the intent to support
the early-stage development of LSC-specific frontline therapy that increases treatment-free remission upon TKI
discontinuation. Our team discovered that the transcription factor KLF4 represses the gene encoding the dual-
specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase DYRK2, allowing LSCs to self-renew and progress the
disease. Thus, deleting the Klf4 gene in a CML mouse model was associated with a lower frequency of LSCs,
leading to leukemia regression and DYRK2 protein upregulation. In addition, inhibiting the SIAH2 ubiquitin ligase
also leads to upregulating the DYRK2 protein, which is associated with cytotoxicity in CML cells. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that DYRK2 is a critical checkpoint that inhibits the survival and self-renewal in LSCs
that can be activated through genetic and pharmacological stabilization of the DYRK2 protein. In this application,
we propose to investigate the regulation of DYRK2 in CML LSCs through genetic studies to validate this
molecular target and identify DYRK2 stabilizers for drug development. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to study
the mechanism of DYRK2 activation in LSC self-renewal through the phosphorylation of downstream targets. In
Specific Aim 2, we will explore the genetic stabilization of the DYRK2 protein by deleting the gene encoding the
ubiquitin ligase SIAH2 and performing a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify pathways regulating
DYRK2 expression. In Specific Aim 3, we propose investigating the anti-leukemic properties of pharmacological
stabilization of DYRK2 protein with small molecules identified in a biased approach and cell-based screens in
pre-clinical mouse models as single agents or combined with imatinib. These comprehensive studies will
elucidate how DYRK2 regulates LSCs, how DYRK2 expression is regulated, and what small molecules stabilize
DYRK2 protein for developing LSC-directed therapy in leukemia."

We propose to develop two short-format, introductory, modular, Course-based Undergraduate Research
Experiences (miniCUREs), and deliver this computational genomics and data science (CGDS) curriculum to a
broad cross-section of undergraduate students. Our RNA-seq miniCURE has been taken by over 500
students across two institutions and provides a robust mechanism to bring computational research experiences
to first year undergraduates nationwide. Building upon our existing RNA-seq miniCURE we plan to enrich and
expand its content by introducing new datasets and integrating the materials onto the NHGRI Genomic Data
Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space, or AnVIL. In parallel, we will develop a new
miniCURE that analyzes the impact of human gut microbiome manipulation and its impact on the host. Our
success will introduce expertise for faculty/instructors and broaden the exposure and use of CGDS material by
currently underserved students at community colleges, minority serving institutions, tribal colleges, and under-
resourced institutions. Specifically, we will: 1) Enhance the RNA-seq miniCURE with the AnVIL platform, 2)
Develop an AnVIL-based human microbiome metagenomics miniCURE, and 3) Broaden miniCURE adoption
across institutions. The modular miniCURE materials can be delivered in a range of formats from in-person or
hybrid short courses, asynchronously, and the potential for massive online open courses. All framework,
content, and pedagogy developed by our team will be open source and made accessible to the broadest
possible audience by leveraging our existing expertise in online and scalable in-person education and
bioinformatics platforms. Together, dissemination of these AnVIL miniCUREs will enable more diverse
educational institutions to provide their students with hands-on research experiences in genomics, enhancing
computational skills, and preparing the next generation of genomics researchers and professionals."
10990396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite advances in cancer therapy, metastatic disease is overwhelmingly fatal and accounts for most cancer-
related deaths. Systemic therapies fail to control disseminated disease due to a mix of innate and acquired
resistance. The processes that drive drug resistance and metastasis are a combination of tumor cell-intrinsic
mechanisms, such as genetic and epigenetic changes, and extrinsic factors, including the tumor immune
microenvironment (TIME). I propose a comprehensive research and training plan to investigate both dimensions.
F99 Phase: My doctoral work focuses on a cancer cell-intrinsic mechanism, the role of Claudin-1 (CLDN1)
expression in promoting chemoresistance and metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). My work thus far (Aim 1A)
details a novel mechanism in which CLDN1 interacts directly with the receptor tyrosine kinase Ephrin type-A
receptor 2 (EPHA2) in CRC and inhibits its degradation. The increase in protein-level EPHA2 enhances AKT
signaling and CD44 expression to promote cancer stemness and chemoresistance. Previous work has shown
that CLDN1 expression promotes CRC metastasis in mouse models. My future work (Aim 1B) will investigate
the molecular details of the CLDN1/EPHA2 interaction; compare patterns of CLDN1 and EPHA2 expression in
patient-matched normal, primary tumor, and metastatic tumor tissues; and look specifically at the role of the
CLDN1/EPHA2 interaction in promoting metastasis. Aim 1 will provide training in bioinformatics, organoid culture,
and orthotopic metastasis models. K00 Phase: In my postdoctoral phase, I will study the extrinsic factors
influencing breast cancer (BC) dormancy and metastasis in the liver. Cancer cells spread to distant organs early
in tumor development. These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) can enter a state of dormancy and survive initial
therapy, only to reactivate years later, resulting in relapse. It is well-accepted that the factors regulating dormancy
and reactivation depend on the microenvironment of the host organ. Even though hepatic BC metastases carry
the worst prognosis, the factors regulating dormancy and reactivation in the liver are understudied, particularly
in a fully intact TIME. In Aim 2.1, I will use immunocompetent mouse models to study the role of T-cells in
regulating BC dormancy in the liver. Evidence suggests that hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation may be a
critical factor in DTC reactivation. Activated HSCs are a hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
NAFLD is the most common liver disease in the world, but its impacts on BC metastasis are not well studied.
Aim 2.2 will use mouse models of NAFLD to study its effect on BC dormancy and metastasis. Aim 2.3 will use
innovative ex vivo whole tissue slice cultures to study the signaling networks regulating BC dormancy and
immune evasion. Aim 2 will provide training in cancer immunology, advanced cancer models that accurately
model the TIME, and analytical techniques capable of single-cell resolution. The proposed studies will offer
insights into the causes and therapeutic vulnerabilities of metastatic disease and will provide a multidimensional
training program that will prepare me for a career as an independent cancer researcher."

We are proposing a competitive revision for R01 HL163085, that will address in vitro and ex vivo the contribution
of systemic vs pulmonary circulation conditions on the mechanisms of structural degeneration of implanted
biomaterials for left and right side cardiac reconstruction approaches.
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) affect nearly 1% of?or about 40,000?births per year in the United States. More
than 40% of CHD patients require the replacement of one of the valves. Congenital lesions of any of the heart
valves are associated with a wide spectrum of cardiac malformations, impacting both the left and right side of the
heart. Left-side anomalies may involve any component of the Aortic or Mitral valve apparatus that result in stenosis,
regurgitation, or mixed hemodynamic disturbances. In adulthood, common diseases of the mitral valve include
degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) and ischemic mitral regurgitation (IMR), for the Aortic Valve, Aortic
Insufficiency (AI), or stenosis. Several CHD primarily affect the right heart including Tetralogy of Fallot,
transposition of great arteries, septal defects leading to pulmonary vascular disease, Ebstein anomaly and
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
For both Left and Right sided CHD reconstructive surgeries, the biomaterials have several important limitations,
impacting long-term biocompatibility and durability. The primary goals of the parent award HL 163085 are: to
understand the mechanisms of accelerated structural degeneration of implantable biomaterials in pediatric and
young adults by assessing the role of protein absorption on implanted biomaterials and to test mitigation strategies
to extend the lifespan of these biomaterials in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo by using juvenile and adult rat models. In
this revised supplement we address how systemic vs pulmonary circulation conditions (including the different blood
biochemistry and hemodynamic conditions) is impacting the materials used for reconstructive heart surgery."
10995039,"SUMMARY
Aging is the most powerful risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and it contributes to the odds of type-2
diabetes mellitus (T2D) as well. Aging is also associated with a decline in the brain’s use of glucose, its most
important fuel. Astrocytes play a key role in shuttling glucose from the bloodstream to where it is needed by
the neuronal units of activity deeper in the brain tissue. We find evidence of a defect in a key glucose transport
molecule of astrocytes in AD and in a mouse line genetically modified to reproduce some aspects of AD. This
mouse line, overproducing the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), exhibits dysregulation of circulating glucose, as well as
a decline in brain glucose use. These effects are correlated with poor performance in a test of spatial memory.
Further mimicking human AD, the mice show these problems in the absence of obesity, hyperglycemia,
disruption of appetite, changes in physical activity, pancreatic abnormality, or insulin resistance. Together,
these findings inspire the hypothesis that Aβ, the levels of which begin to rise in the aging brain even without
frank AD, perturbs the ability of astrocytes to bring peripheral glucose to neurons, where it is needed for the
increased neurological activity associated with memory and other functions. This idea will be tested through
studies of the status and function of glucose transport proteins in aging mouse and human brains, along with
comparisons between normal aging, AD, and T2D. Through genetic modification of mice, we will modulate the
levels of the most important astrocytic glucose transporter to determine if it is i) sufficient to bring about
interrupted glucose delivery and memory deficits, and ii) necessary for the presentation of these problems in
an AD model. These studies thus explore a novel hypothesis about a specific element of energy utilization in
the aging brain and its connection to age-related cognitive impairment. As such, the project may provide
innovative strategies for therapeutic intervention."
11000399,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Education is among the most important predictors of cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment (including
MCI and AD/ADRD). However, because scientists do not know how or why education matters for these cognitive
outcomes, it is difficult to design effective interventions. There is currently very little information about (a) the
specific aspects of education that prevent or provide resilience to cognitive impairment and (b) the pathways
through which those effects operate. A major reason for this lack of information about how or why education
matters for these cognitive outcomes is that data on educational opportunities, environments, and attainments
have mainly been gathered via retrospective reports. To know how and why education matters for cognitive
functioning and impairment, the scientific community needs high quality prospective studies that follow young
people through schools and throughout adulthood, measures key and modifiable aspects of education, and then
assess cognitive functioning later in life.
This project brings together an interdisciplinary team of leading neurologists, neuropsychologists, sociologists,
education scientists, and survey methodologists who will design protocols to re-contact all ≈25,500 surviving
members the High School & Beyond (HSB) cohort—a nationally representative random sample of Americans
first interviewed in high school in 1980—and use the resulting data to conduct transformative analyses of the
effects of education on cognitive function and risk for impairment at midlife. The project has five aims: (Aim 1)
To estimate the effects of (a) adolescent cognitive and non-cognitive skills, (b) secondary school course taking
and college field of study, and (c) other school structures and social environments on cognitive functioning and
impairment at midlife; (Aim 2) To assess the degree to which racial/ethnic differences in those aspects of
education explain racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive functioning and impairment; (Aim 3) To assess the degree
to which the effects of education are mediated by educational attainment, economic strain, and the cognitive
complexity of paid jobs at midlife; and (Aim 4) To assess the degree to which race/ethnicity and genetic risk
factors moderate the effects of education on cognitive functioning and impairment. To gather the data required
to pursue these Aims, the investigators will conduct an internet/phone survey and gather genetic material via a
mail-back saliva kit. (Aim5) The resulting database and associated documentation and metadata will be made
freely available to the research community to facilitate scholarship on the development of MCI, AD/ADRD, and
cognitive decline."
11000513,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this project is to harness the untapped reactivity of abundant feedstock materials and
renewable natural products to enable the production of useful synthetic intermediates and the late-stage
functionalization of biomedically relevant molecules. In particular, we have recently formulated new approaches
for selective C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond functionalization of alkenes, using a combination of O3-mediated oxidation and
Fe(II)-mediated reductive fragmentation–radical capture. The net result has been replacement of the alkene
C(sp3)–C(sp2) bond with C(sp3)–H, C(sp3)–S, C(sp3)–O, C=O, and C(sp3)–C(sp2) bonds. This redox-based
dealkenylative radical chemistry has allowed us to employ readily available natural products (e.g., terpenoids)
as starting materials to streamline the chemical synthesis of biologically active natural product targets and active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). While many synthetic methods rely on the functionalization of C(sp2)–C(sp2)
double bonds, generalized methods for functionalizing alkene C(sp3)–C(sp2) linkages remain elusive. Our
reaction is the first generalized functionalization of the C(sp3)–C(sp2) single bond; therefore, we envisioned that
it would have broad impact on total synthesis, the late-stage diversification of pharmaceuticals, and the
preparation of value-added compounds from abundant starting materials. Going forward, we propose to develop
Fe(II)- or Cu(I)-catalyzed functionalization of alkene C(sp3)–C(sp2) bonds for the construction of C(sp3)–C and
C(sp3)–heteroatom bonds. Our inspiration for these transition metal–catalyzed dealkenylative cross-coupling
strategies originated from the bio-pathway for H2O2 decomposition catalyzed by Cu- and Fe-containing
peroxygenases. Furthermore, Cu possesses exceptional capacity for both the radical capture and reductive
elimination steps necessary for radical cross-couplings. We have used these catalytic strategies for modular
construction of C(sp3)–N bonds within terpenes and terpenoids, affording artificial terpenoid alkaloids, and to
provide a new vision for the editing of all-carbon frameworks. We will expand this strategy to C(sp3)–C bond-
forming processes related to, for example, Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, the Sonogashira reaction,
trifluoromethylation, and cyanation. We will expand the source of alkyl radicals to include carbonyls and phenols,
both of which can be converted into α-alkoxy hydroperoxides—the pivotal reaction intermediates. Finally,
leveraging the power of well-established enantioselective allylation, we will seek to establish a divergent route
to access a wide variety of enantiopure molecules featuring chiral quaternary centers. Realization of these
proposed aims would substantially impact the sustainable synthesis of fine chemicals. These studies will also
provide new visions and strategies for the editing of alkenes and other natural products. While our program does
not target a specific disease, collectively it could impact a variety of therapeutic areas by producing valuable
synthetic intermediates for and facilitating divergent modification of biomedically relevant molecules."

Candidate: Nicole DePasquale, PhD, MSPH, is an Assistant Professor at the Duke University School of
Medicine and is fully committed to becoming an independently-funded investigator at the intersection of
dyadic science and disease management. Her long-term career goal is to develop family-centered interventions
to optimize individual and dyadic health among older adults with chronic disease and their family care
partners. Dr. DePasquale’s interdisciplinary background makes her an ideal candidate to merge these two
largely separate areas of inquiry. Her previous scientific training spans multiple fields of study, and her
research experiences have been both quantitative and qualitative in nature.
Career development and training plan: Dr. DePasquale’s career development and training plan feature a
multidisciplinary mentoring team comprising a general internist/clinical epidemiologist, geriatrician, health
services researcher, social/health psychologist, biostatistician, and board-certified nephrologist. This team will
support her pursuit of 5 training areas chosen to provide targeted theoretical, methodological, and practical
expertise needed to complete the K01 research and facilitate her transition to complete independence: 1) the
fundamental aspects of caring for aging patients with kidney disease, 2) dyadic disease management, 3) applied
research design and advanced quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques, 4) the development and
testing of family-centered interventions, and 5) professional development (best research practices, research
collaborations, leadership, and grant writing). Additional resources to foster her career development include
Duke’s Claude D. Pepper Center; Edward R. Roybal Center; Offices for Faculty Development, Scientific
Integrity, Research Mentoring, and Research Development; and Clinical Research Training Program.
Research plan: The proposed research will use different methodological approaches to understand ways in
which older patients and their family care partners manage the full course of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
together, and how dyadic management affects individual and dyadic health. This research has 3 aims: 1)
quantify associations of care partner contributions to disease self-care with patient CKD self-management self-
efficacy and depression over time (secondary data analysis); 2) investigate the interrelations of dyadic disease
appraisal, disease management, and health along the continuum of CKD progression (primary data collection
through patient and care partner interviews and surveys); and 3) adapt and pilot test the feasibility of SHARE
for CKD, a care planning program to support care dyads’ management of CKD, with CKD care dyads. The goal
of this work is to move beyond individual experiences and outcomes related to CKD self-management by
focusing on shared management within the care dyad, which will assist research, clinical care, and health
policies in better supporting patients and care partners alike. Findings will provide Dr. DePasquale with
preliminary data to refine SHARE for CKD and test its effectiveness in a R01-funded trial."

10984801,"Abstract
Cognitive impairment is a significant source of neurological disability, and a majority of cases are caused by
vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Differences
in the incidence among Black individuals compared to White individuals lead to a disproportionate burden of
cognitive impairment in this group. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS)
Study is a longitudinal multi-racial study of 30,239 community-dwelling participants designed to enhance the
understanding of these conditions and identify potential contributors to racial disparities. Using our metabolomics
platform, our previous studies have shown that metabolites are independent risk factors for stroke and many of
these markers are synthesized by gut microbiota. Our studies further highlighted that metabolites can illuminate
racial differences in disease risk, and that gut microbiome-related metabolites are modifiers of the relationship
between dietary intake and stroke. In the current proposal, we will expand upon our findings and unravel the
relationships between gut microbiome-related metabolites, VCID and AD biomarkers, and subsequent cognitive
impairment. We seek to address our hypothesis in the following aims in the REGARDS study, with replication in
the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort: 1. To examine the association between
gut microbiome metabolites and CSVD brain MRI phenotypes in REGARDS and CARDIA, and assess for
differences by race. 2. To determine the association between gut microbiome-related metabolites and the
incidence and trajectory of cognitive impairment. 3. To determine the association between biomarkers of brain
amyloid β (Aβ+) status and cognitive impairment in REGARDS, and assess for effect modification by gut-related
metabolites. Collectively, these aims will provide insight into the relationships between diet and circulating
metabolites on the progression to cognitive impairment through CSVD and Aβ+ pathways. Our multidisciplinary
collaboration includes investigators who bring collective expertise in metabolite profiling, imaging markers of
VCID, epidemiology cohort studies, cognition and aging, and health disparities. Identifying markers that provide
insight in these mechanisms may provide actionable leads for future interventional studies, inform personalized
treatment targets, and ultimately may lead to novel gut microbial engineering therapeutics."

Medication nonadherence leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and costs the US healthcare system
hundreds of billions of dollars annually. While there have been decades of research regarding nonadherence,
newer research shows that interventions that focus on behavior change, and specifically, habit-building, have
the most potential to result in improvement. Given their higher rates of nonadherence and decreased self-
management skills, adolescents with chronic conditions will benefit most from medication adherence
interventions. Our prior work shows that adolescents with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) – a chronic immune-
mediated inflammatory disease of the esophagus with a rapidly rising incidence – have low medication
adherence rates secondary to lack of planning and forgetfulness. Thus, we created a prototype of a clinical tool
(a habit-based medication “Action Plan”) and iteratively modified it using stakeholder engagement. The specific
aims of this proposal are to: 1) establish an optimal version of this tool - the “Medication Habit Action Plan
(MHAP)” – through usability testing (end-user testing with patients and nurses), 2) conduct a pilot randomized
controlled trial of the MHAP to determine feasibility and inform a larger multicenter future hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial, and 3) measure the effect of dupilumab on adherence and EoE clinical outcomes in
nonadherent adolescents using a prospective cohort study design. This career development award is designed
to support the transition of Pooja Mehta, MD, MSCS, an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the University of
Colorado, into an independent clinician-scientist and to achieve her long-term career goal of improving
outcomes in children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Guidance from a multidisciplinary mentorship team
(Dr. Glenn T. Furuta- renowned EoE clinical researcher, Dr. Bethany Kwan- dissemination and implementation
scientist, and Dr. Sheana Bull- user-centered design and technology expert) will be coupled with training in 1)
clinical trial design and conduct, 2) dissemination and implementation science, and 3) healthcare data
integration across multiple institutions. Together, these will provide Dr. Mehta with the foundation needed to
successfully create and test adherence-related interventions in large-scale multi-center pragmatic trials. The
University of Colorado provides a unique environment to conduct pragmatic research and is supported by
collaborative partnerships between The Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and
Delivery Science, The University of Colorado Mobile Health Impact Laboratory, Children's Hospital Colorado
Gastrointestinal Eosinophilic Diseases Program, and Denver Health (Denver's safety net hospital). EoE serves
as an ideal disease model to study habit-based medication adherence interventions and will have widespread
applicability to a broad range of chronic pediatric gastrointestinal diseases. Ultimately, completion of this
research proposal and career development plan will help Dr. Mehta achieve her overall career goal of
addressing treatment nonadherence in children with chronic diseases to improve child health outcomes."
10984126,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
My research proposal addresses the critical health issue of insufficient human milk production. Only a quarter
of mothers in the U.S. meet recommended breastfeeding targets, resulting in significant costs and infant
mortality. Low milk production is a prevalent reason for early cessation of breastfeeding, yet the physiological
factors contributing to this problem remain poorly understood, and as a result diagnosis markers and
treatments are limited. This proposal utilizes my molecular biology expertise, in conjunction with clinical
studies, to illuminate the physiological and transcriptional aspects of human milk production regulation. In my
preliminary work, I generated genomic datasets, including bulk RNA-seq and single cell (sc) RNA-seq, from
human milk samples obtained from a cohort of individuals with low, normal, and high milk production and found
several differentially expressed genes, including a yet to be characterized gene called C6orf15. In this
proposal, I will characterize the function of C6orf15 using cell line and mouse models to understand how it is
involved in increasing milk production. Using samples collected from a cohort of breastfeeding mothers I will
explore the factors influencing infant weight gain by conducting a comprehensive analysis, including a 24-hour
test weighing and milk composition. In addition, I will use transcriptomic profiling of mammary gland to identify
additional markers and better understand the molecular changes under low milk production. In my independent
phase of this award, I will characterize the efficiency of commonly used breast pumping protocols to increase
milk supply. A randomized controlled trial will determine the optimal frequency of pumping required to enhance
milk production and will also determine if lower frequency of pumping increases compliance of mothers to the
protocol and leads to a better breastfeeding experience and longer breastfeeding duration. Finally, I will identify
molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the observed increased milk production through bulk RNA-seq
on samples collected before and after intervention and will be analyzing milk composition (inflammation
markers, milk maturation, and macronutrient) and hormonal regulation. This work will uncover the changes in
the mammary gland transcriptome and milk composition under different pumping protocols. In summary, my
application combines clinical and molecular studies to shed light on the factors influencing human milk
production. The results will improve the diagnosis and treatment of insufficient milk production, addressing a
significant women's health issue with far-reaching implications for infant and maternal well-being."

 Chlamydia species are important pathogens that represent a paradigm for understanding
successful obligate intracellular parasitism. C. trachomatis is a prevalent human pathogens,
whereas C. muridarum is a murine-specific pathogen often used to study chlamydial disease in
a small animal model. Species-specific variability in coding capacity within the so-called
plasticity zone of the chlamydial chromosome is thought to be one source dictating differences
in infection biology. The presence/absence of genes encoding glycosyltransferases designated
as putative cytotoxins represents an intriguing example of this diversity. C. muridarum express
multiple homologous proteins that also show similarity to a family of larger cytotoxins. The
plasticity zone of common urogenital C. trachomatis serovars express a truncated protein while
ocular serovars of members of the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar lack the toxin
genes completely. These cytotoxins have been proposed to mediate immediate toxicity in highly
infected epithelial cells by interfering with actin polymerization. Lack of tractable genetics in C,
muridarum and urogenital C. trachomatis, in particular has previously confounded definitive
studies, leading to a paucity in details regarding molecular mechanisms of infection. We have
overcome this barrier by deletion of putative cytotoxin genes in C. muridarum. Our data
indicated that these proteins were dispensable for immediate toxicity. Combined with analysis of
C. trachomatis CT166, our data implicate an alternative function for these proteins. We propose
to apply genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate molecular function(s) of these
putative glycosyltransferases and address their contribution(s) to species-specific infection
biology."

SUMMARY AND SPECIFIC AIMS OF PARENT GRANT (R21CA282629, PI: KATZ). Although T cell mediated 
immune responses are critical for successful immunotherapy, T cells associated with malignant lesions are 
typically dysfunctional and fail to control tumor growth. Treatment with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that 
are isolated, activated, and expanded ex vivo has proven effective in some melanoma patient populations. 
However, many patients do not respond, presumably due to one of several host immune factors. Current 
understanding of TIL mechanism of action suggests both an early robust expansion of tumor-specific effector T 
cells and transfer of less differentiated cells with long-term survival capacity are key to successful therapy. 
Evidence for the former includes the need for high dose exogenous IL-2 at the time of TIL infusion, correlation 
of response with a high frequency of effector T cells, and majority of tumor killing occurring early after the initiation 
of therapy. Evidence for the latter is found in many pre-clinical experiments as well as clinical observations where 
the presence of TILs from the central memory subset in the infusion product correlates with tumor regression. 
Our overall goal is to improve TIL therapeutic efficacy through generation of TIL products with both the transient 
ability to effectively immediately kill tumor cells and the long-term ability to persist and maintain durable antitumor responses. We have developed robust methods to reprogram TILs with mRNA-mediated gene therapy. 
The use of our mRNA approach has the advantages of increased safety, high efficiency, rapid production, tightly 
controlled expression levels, and simultaneous multi-factor reprogramming. In preliminary work, we developed 
a system that increases mRNA lifespan by an order of magnitude. Our single cell analysis of patient TILs preand post-expansion has identified two specific pathways deficient in the expanded TIL product that likely 
contribute to their poor immediate efficacy and absence of memory fate. Both will be augmented by TIL mRNA 
reprogramming. By leveraging our multidisciplinary team and existing infrastructure, the knowledge gained from 
this project will be quickly translatable into clinical trials to examine the efficacy of mRNA reprogramming of TIL 
to improve treatment of patients with advanced melanoma. We will complete the following Specific Aims: 
Aim 1. Determine the ability to enhance post-expansion TIL survival. 
1.1. Increase TIL durability by expression of an anti-apoptotic protein with a novel long-lived (loli) mRNA 
expression system. 
1.2. Augment TIL efficacy by reprogramming with supportive cytokine mRNAs. 
1.3. Analyze efficacy of TILs reprogrammed with survival and cytokine mRNAs in patient derived xenografts. 
Hypothesis: TILs encounter a large bottleneck of elimination upon infusion as they adapt from ex vivo culture 
conditions to the harsh tumor microenvironment. By reprogramming with survival mRNAs that have long-lived 
expression, the total, diverse TIL population will be able to acclimate with amplified efficacy.
Aim 2. Define the ability to produce post-expansion central memory (TCM/SCM) TILs. 
2.1. Stimulate TCM TILs through enhancing OX40-OX40L interactions. 
2.2. Steer TIL phenotype to TSCM by expression of Notch1 ICD mRNA. 
2.3. Analyze efficacy of TCM/SCM-guided TILs in patient derived xenografts. 
Hypothesis: Although the TCM/SCM phenotype is important for improved immunotherapy outcomes, our preliminary 
data support that post-expansion TILs are predominantly TEM (effector memory). However, we also find that 
OX40L identifies small populations of TCM/SCM and that loss of TCM/SCM in post-expansion cells corresponds to loss 
of Notch1 activating ligands. Augmenting these pathways may enrich for this desirable phenotype."

As the U.S. population ages, the number of individuals living with dementia is rapidly increasing, making the
identification of modifiable risk factors more urgent than ever. Recent research, including our own studies,
suggests a significant association between poor oral health, such as periodontitis and tooth loss, and an
increased risk of developing dementia. However, the specifics of how poor oral health influences dementia,
particularly its association with two different subtypes of dementia, like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular
dementia (VaD), remain largely unexplored. The systemic inflammatory responses caused by periodontal
diseases will lead to the formation of amyloid-beta peptides (Aβ) and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles,
contributing to the progression of AD. Our prior study also found subgingival periodontal bacteria at both genera
and species levels is associated with reduced cerebrospinal fluid Aβ-42. However, the biological mechanisms
underpinning the relationship between oral health and different subtypes of dementia are understudied. It is also
unknow how social determinants of health (SDoH) impact the link between oral health and dementia. Our study
aims to address these knowledge gaps by analyzing multiple extensive population-based datasets, including
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-2018) and Health and Retirement Study (2006-2020),
both linked to Medicare claims data (available up to 2021), Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (2004-2021),
UK Biobank (UKB, 2006-2021), and Genome-Wide Association Study datasets (i.e., UKB, FinnGen Biobank,
and MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit). These datasets offer a comprehensive view, encompassing large,
diverse racial/ethnic samples, and providing unique insights into the association between oral health and
dementia. Our specific aims include Aim 1: Establish the relationship between poor oral health and clinical
biomarkers of dementia (Aβ, tau proteins, and brain atrophy) and AD or VaD. We hypothesize that poor oral
health will be associated with the presence of clinical biomarkers of dementia and incident AD or VaD. Aim 2:
Test the three hypothetical biological pathways (i.e., systemic inflammation, accelerated biological aging, and
dysbiotic oral microbiome) linking oral health with AD and VaD. We hypothesize that systemic inflammation and
accelerated biological aging will mediate the association between poor oral health and incident AD or VaD. We
will conduct exploratory analyses of the links among poor oral health, dysbiotic oral microbiome, and AD/VaD.
Aim 3: Determine potential moderators that can influence the relationships of poor oral health with AD and VaD.
Key SDoH will be included as moderators. We hypothesize that females, racial/ethnic minoritized older adults,
and those with lower social support and higher social isolation, residing in impoverished areas, would face higher
AD/VaD risks with poor oral health exposure. The findings will illuminate the causal relationship between poor
oral health and dementia, guide targeted interventions to reduce dementia risks, and contribute to dementia
prevention and control strategies including early diagnosis, management, treatment, and genetic counseling."
10994353,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity (MoTrPAC), Nutrition for Precision Health (NPH), and the Human
Health Exposure Analysis Resource (HHEAR) are NIH-funded national projects (three originating from NIH
Common Fund initiatives) that measure thousands of metabolites in large cohorts of human subjects under
exercise, diet, environmental exposure conditions respectively. The Common Fund initiated Metabolomics
Workbench, which serves as the data repository, the metabolomics harmonization center and the data analytics
workbench for deep analyses of human metabolomics and provides the infrastructure to develop the concept of
human metabotype. We characterize the metabolomic state of groups of individuals with common homeostatic
points for a collection of metabolites as “human metabotypes”. More precisely, the metabotype defines a
collection of metabolites or metabolite classes that is unique (in the metabolomic hyperspace) to a class of
individuals – defined in this project through metabolomics measurements from humans subject to exercise and
diet perturbations and humans subject to distinct environmental exposures. Human subjects can be classified
as belonging to one of several distinct groups (e.g., clusters in a UMAP) defining the metabotype for a chosen
set of metabolites in a class. At the quantitative level, the distinct groups are defined by distinct profiles of
metabolites or metabolite classes.
The major goal of this project is to use the three national projects to develop the “metabotype” concept into a
concrete set of points in the metabolomics hyperspace that define the human physiological state. Towards this,
we harmonize the metabolomics data across the national projects, identify the clusters of metabolites/metabolite
classes that define a group of human subjects, and provide the biological context to the metabotype. The tools
we will develop will enable an end user to analyze and decipher the physiological function that further defines
the metabotype and explore perturbations such as exercise, diet, or changing environment to see how the
homeostatic endotype points change into another possible homeostatic state.
Most importantly, given that the definition of the endotypes in the MoTrPAC, NPH and HHEAR projects largely
refer to healthy human subjects, we will develop the ability for any individual with their metabolomic
measurements to map their data on the metabotype space. Using such a “Metabotype Calculator”, the most
valuable product of this project, a human subject will be able to assess their “state of health” and assess how
perturbations such as exercise or diet will alter their homeostatic metabotype states. We anticipate that the
“Metabotype Calculator” will serve as a dynamic living counterpart to the genotype in defining the human
subject’s state of physiology. All the resources developed in this project will be available on the Common Fund
Data Ecosystem Data Repository Center (CFDE DRC). The Principal Investigator (PI) of this U24, also the CFDE
DRC PI, will facilitate making this resource available to the user community."

This competing renewal of CA119171-17 “Nutrition and Physical Activity Assessment Study” (NPAAS)
continues to focus on dietary biomarker discovery and application of these biomarkers to investigations of diet
and risk of cancer and other chronic diseases in the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI). In our recent funding
cycles, we developed novel metabolomics and stable isotope ratio biomarkers of diet in the NPAAS Feeding
Study and the NPAAS Observational Study and used these biomarkers to model diet-chronic disease
associations in older women. We now turn to the WHI Dietary Modification (WHI-DM) Trial where gaps remain
in understanding the biology of the intervention effects (both a priori hypothesized and those observed with
further interrogations of the data) and in the interpretation of intervention effects on clinical outcomes. Our
goals for this renewal are to use targeted metabolomics to delineate effect biomarkers and biological
mechanisms underlying WHI-DM intervention effects and to elucidate the role of the dietary fat reduction
intervention component in observed findings. The WHI-DM, a 2-arm randomized controlled trial in 48,835
women, was designed to test whether a low-fat (20% of total kcal) dietary pattern including 5 daily servings of
fruits and vegetables and 6 daily servings of grains would reduce risk of invasive breast and colorectal cancers
in postmenopausal women. While neither invasive breast nor colorectal cancers were significantly reduced by
the ~8.5 y intervention (P=0.09 and P=0.45, respectively), women in the intervention arm experienced
numerous clinically meaningful effects on important measures of metabolic health and long-term health and
mortality outcomes. Many differences in clinical factors (e.g., metabolic syndrome, body weight) between
intervention and comparison groups were detected early in the trial and are risk factors for several cancers.
Metabolomic profiling may uncover mechanistic underpinnings of these findings since these small molecules
are responsive to diet change and reflect biological phenotype. Our specific aims are 1) Evaluate the effect of
the WHI-DM intervention on the targeted serum metabolome and lipidome and biochemical pathways; 2)
Investigate how the metabolites mediate intervention effects on body measurements and intermediate
biomarkers of metabolic health; and 3) Elucidate the contribution of the trial’s fat reduction to intervention
effects. In collaboration with the Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, we will use established targeted
metabolomics platforms to interrogate archived serum collected at baseline and year 1 among 1000 WHI-DM
women (500 intervention arm/500 comparison arm) and in a subset (n=465) of this 1000 at end of intervention.
Results will elucidate biochemical pathways related to downstream risk for breast, colorectal, endometrial, and
total cancer, as well as obesity and other chronic diseases. Results are expected to reveal metabolic pathways
that explain the clinically meaningful effects from a large low-fat, high fruit and vegetable dietary pattern
intervention and to provide insight into the dietary fat reduction in yielding these intervention effects."
10980670,"A major problem in research and practice is that bilingual students in the U.S. are often misidentified having
language and reading disorders. Both over- and under-diagnosis of disorders have serious consequences,
including long-term reading difficulty and potential high school dropout. This highlights a critical need for valid,
accurate diagnostic protocols to reliably identify language and reading disorders among young bilingual learners.
Consequently, the long-term goal of the proposed research is to establish practical, accurate diagnostic protocols
for identifying language and reading disorders among bilingual learners early in children’s development.
Representing the next step toward this goal, the overall objective of this project is to generate assessment
protocols that have evidence of reliability and validity for identifying language and/or reading disorders among
Spanish-English bilingual learners in kindergarten to 2nd grade. Through annual assessments of children’s
decoding and linguistic comprehension skills in Spanish and English, we will integrate information from static
bilingual assessment, learning-based dynamic assessment, and parent/teacher report to identify accurate,
reliable markers of language and reading disorders. Three specific aims will be addressed. First, we will develop
an empirically derived protocol to identify word reading difficulty (WRD; also, dyslexia) among Spanish-English
bilingual children across kindergarten through second grade. Second, we will develop an empirically derived
protocol to identify developmental language disorder (DLD) among Spanish-English bilingual children across
kindergarten through second grade. Third, we will identify how heterogeneity in reading ability influences links
between word reading, oral language, and reading comprehension, measured continuously. This work is
significant because it will substantially advance diagnostic practice for identifying language and word reading
disorders among bilingual learners, contributing to accurate diagnoses to prevent students from falling behind
their peers during the early elementary years. Early identification of bilingual students likely to have difficulty in
school allows educators to allocate specialized resources and individualized instruction to maximize gains for
those students. This work is innovative because it fills a critical need to establish classification protocols for both
WRD and DLD with evidence of reliability and validity for young bilingual children, focuses on bilingual learners
with a wide range of English and Spanish exposure, use, and proficiencies, and integrates cutting-edge dynamic
and static assessment procedures (including consideration of student responsiveness to intervention) to improve
the reliability and validity of diagnostic classification, and considers language and reading development
simultaneously to improve identification of subgroups of children with reading difficulty."

Acute hyperglycemia following an ischemic stroke is a significant contributor to poor clinical outcome, even
though it is temporary. While intensive insulin treatment can correct hyperglycemia, it does not necessarily
improve patient outcome, suggesting the presence of early hyperglycemic injuries that are resistant to glucose
control. Red blood cells (RBCs), often overlooked in stroke research, are particularly vulnerable to
hyperglycemia due to their exclusive reliance on glucose for energy and limited adaptability to metabolic
disturbances in high glucose condition. Our pilot study has identified abnormal RBC indices in stroke patients
experiencing acute hyperglycemia, which, in turn, were predictive of poor stroke outcome. Further analyses
revealed that acute hyperglycemia may initiate a shift in RBC glucose metabolism from the pentose phosphate
pathway (PPP) towards the hexosamine pathway, potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress within
RBCs. Notably, these RBC changes were unresponsive to glucose normalization, but were able to impair the
function of brain endothelial cells, indicating their novel role in acute hyperglycemic injury in ischemic stroke. In
this multiple PI project, we aim to investigate the role of RBCs in stroke-related hyperglycemia through
translational research and mechanistic studies. We will characterize acute hyperglycemia-related RBC
alterations in clinical stroke patients, with specific focus on RBC glucose metabolism and the consequent
oxidative stress (Aim 1). We will then delve deeper into the mechanisms of RBC alterations in in vitro
hyperglycemic models and assess their impact on brain endothelial functions (Aim 2). Finally, we will validate
our findings in a well-established acute hyperglycemic stroke mouse model and explore the potential of
modifying RBCs to mitigate brain injury and improve stroke outcome in the context of acute hyperglycemia
(Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will yield a comprehensive understanding of the effects of acute
hyperglycemia on RBCs and their consequences on vascular function, ultimately translating into enhanced
clinical care and patient will-being."

Cancer-associated RAS mutants were once considered oncogenic equivalents. However, it is increasingly clear
that mutants of the same RAS isoform (H-, K- or NRAS) and amino acid (codon 12, 13) can exhibit distinct
GTPase, effector binding, signal transduction, and tumorigenic properties. These distinctions may contribute to
disparities in therapeutic response as well as the enrichment of specific RAS isoforms and amino acid
substitutions in each cancer type. Thus, a deeper understanding of how each amino acid substitution influences
RAS structure, biochemistry, and function could yield meaningful biological and clinical advances.
KRAS mutants are well-studied, but whether the biochemical consequences of an amino acid change in one
RAS isoform can be extended to another is unclear. In particular, research into the mutant-specific functions of
NRAS, the dominant RAS oncoprotein in thyroid cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and melanoma, is limited.
Here, we examine the ability of eight different oncogenic NRAS oncoproteins to induce spontaneous melanoma
in mouse models. We find that oncogenic substitutions, even in the same amino acid of NRAS, have distinct
melanomagenic potential. Our preliminary data link the greater melanomagenic potential of these mutants to
structural features that enhance BRAF affinity, activation, and Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling. These observations are consistent with studies linking increasing MAPK activity to melanoma
progression in human nevi. Furthermore, we provide evidence that current knowledge of KRAS mutants cannot
be translated to NRAS. Based on these data, we hypothesize that melanoma formation depends on
substitution- and isoform-specific structural differences in NRAS that enhance BRAF dimerization and
MAPK>ERK signaling. In Aim 1, we propose integrated X-ray, NMR, computational, and biochemical
approaches to determine the structural ensembles and biochemical properties of NRAS oncoproteins of varying
melanomagenic potential and compare these profiles to similar KRAS mutants. In Aim 2, we describe a
combination of structural, biochemical, and live-cell reporter experiments to determine how NRAS mutants
differentially recognize and promote BRAF activation. In Aim 3, we will test the concept that a transient
pharmacological approach could prevent melanoma by eliminating NRAS-mutant cancer precursors with
elevated MAPK>ERK signaling from the skin.
If successful, these studies will uncover distinguishing structural and biochemical features of the NRAS
oncoproteins that may lead to the identification of new interfaces for drug targeting, determine the molecular
basis for NRAS-driven melanomagenesis, elucidate RAS isoform-specific mechanisms of RAF activation, and
test a potential prevention strategy for NRAS-mutant melanoma."

 Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign smooth muscle cell (SMC) tumors of the myometrium.
Leiomyomas represent the most frequent clinical indication for hysterectomy that often prematurely ends a
woman's reproductive capability. In the year 2010, the estimated annual cost of uterine fibroid tumors in the
United States was $5.9-34.4 billion. Yet in spite of this, there are currently no approved drugs that can provide
effective, long-term treatment for these tumors. There is an unmet need to identify molecular targets for the
development of therapies to treat uterine fibroids. The major goal of the project is to understand the role of REST
and MED12, tumor suppressors functionally lost or mutated in uterine fibroids, in the molecular pathogenesis of
uterine leiomyomas. The two participating laboratories have made important discoveries on the role of REST
and MED12 in the pathogenesis of UL utilizing genetically modified mouse models for the loss of REST and for
the most common missense mutation in the MED12 gene respectively. Crucially, data from Rest conditional
knockout in the mouse uterus showed that the loss of REST expression leads to UL tumor formation, increased
estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) pathway activation and revealed a direct role for REST in regulating progesterone
receptor function in the uterus. Additionally, UL tumorigenesis in the Med12 mutant mouse model is uniquely
dependent on both progesterone and estrogen. Importantly, REST, an epigenetic regulator, is known to interact
with MED12. The current proposal brings together two of the most critical tumor suppressor molecules in UL for
a comprehensive investigation into their role in the dysregulation of estrogen – progesterone pathways in uterine
fibroids. The project will define molecular hallmarks for the development of tissue selective progesterone and
estrogen receptor modulators in the future."

The incidence of chronic diseases such as metabolic disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer,
neurodegenerative disease remain persistently high in South Carolina and are disproportionally greater in the
central region of the state-called the Midlands. The overarching goal of this Center for Translational Research

translational research capacity at the University of South Carolina (USC) which is geographically positioned in
the middle of the state (Midlands), namely the Center for Clinical and Translational Research at USC-
CLINTRUSC. We will leverage existing clinical/translational research expertise within the USC School of
Medicine, nationally recognized health science research within the USC School of Public Health, the School of
Pharmacy, College of Nursing and the School of Social Work, which will allow us to tap into an important research
work force that extends beyond the usual confines of academic medicine-based clinical trial infrastructure. This
also will allow us to engage meaningfully with high-risk communities that may be inaccessible or resistant to
more conventional approaches. Moreover, we will engage our health systems partners; Prisma Health (the
largest health care provider in the state) and the Veterans Administration (VA) Health System to develop a
centralized, cohesive approach to perform clinical and translational research throughout the Midlands of South
Carolina. The CLINTRUSC program will develop the 5 essential cores required for a CTR-D which will result for
the first time at USC, a cohesive infrastructure to quickly deploy clinical/translational research projects within the

The Administrative Core (AC) of the Center for Clinical & Translational Research at the University of South
Carolina (CLINTRUSC) aims to improve incidence, survival, and mortality of preventable diseases, including
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its precursor conditions, cardiovascular disease, cancer,
neurodegenerative, and infectious diseases. We have documented disparities in African Americans and other
socioeconomically marginalized and medically underserved individuals in our region and have made some
progress in reducing disease incidence and improving survival.1-20 However, much more needs to be done.
Over several decades we have discerned that the major impediment to making additional progress concerns
our inability to create a cadre of physician scientists and other healthcare providers committed to serving in our
community who can conduct community-relevant research, including both primary, mechanism-focused studies
and dissemination and implementation science. As described in the Overall, we have many of the pieces
necessary to create a high-impact clinical and translational (C&T) research program that will benefit our most
vulnerable citizens. These assets include core resources developed by other IDeA programs, including INBRE
and COBRE. They also include structures and programs developed within the Arnold School of Public Health,
School of Medicine, Colleges of Pharmacy and Nursing and other units within the University of South Carolina
that can be used to support broad-based efforts at creating a cadre of physician scientists and conducting
population-relevant research.
The AC is committed to concentrating effective action undertaken through the CLINTRUSC Cores to deepen
the understanding of the role of modifiable risk factors in modulating disease incidence and severity and to
devising innovative means to translate findings to places of effective action. The AC will oversee a
comprehensive effort to build (C&T) research capacity by expanding and developing infrastructure, expertise,
and a workforce willing and able to address health disparities in our region. The AC will coordinate the
activities of all organizations and entities shown in Figure 1, including participating academic units, committees,
and boards. We also will marshal existing USC core resources and monitor and manage the CLINTRUSC
budget, prepare accurate and timely program and financial reports, and conduct annual performance
evaluations of Cores. CLINTRUSC leaders are strongly committed to ensuring that all research findings are
translated to places of public health and clinical need where they will be directly and immediately relevant to
our high-risk populations. This means that all interventions and other research aimed at reducing disease
incidence and severity and increasing disability-free survival. To achieve our goals and specific aims, are
committed to ensuring that the results emanating from CLINTRUSC will be designed for dissemination."
10982236,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Myelin is essential for rapid and precise nerve signaling, and its loss in diseases like multiple sclerosis causes
profound disability. Classically, myelin was considered to be inert—hardwired during development to maximize
conduction velocity. However, over the last two decades, myelin has been revealed to be surprisingly dynamic
in the adult brain and to possess broader roles in plasticity and metabolic support of neurons. We recently
discovered that when mice learn a new motor task, the local pattern of myelin remodels in the motor cortex,
specifically on neurons activated during learning. Remodeling occurs in two stages: existing sheaths shorten
during learning, then new sheaths form after learning. The role of myelin remodeling in learning remains a
major knowledge gap, largely due to our lack of tools to experimentally perturb sheath dynamics. In this
application, we propose to investigate the cellular mechanisms that drive learning-induced sheath remodeling,
then use this knowledge to test the extent to which remodeling is required for learning. Our central hypothesis
is that oligodendrocyte calcium signaling is the key mechanistic link by which neural activity is sensed and
translated into sheath dynamics—sheath elongation and/or shortening. The objectives of this proposal are: (1)
Determine whether calcium signaling is require for myelin sheath shortening during learning. (2) Determine
whether calcium signaling is required for new myelin sheath formation after learning. (3) Determine whether
calcium signaling-dependent myelin remodeling regulates motor behavior. By combining our labs’
complementary expertise in longitudinal in vivo imaging of myelin dynamics during learning, myelin cell biology,
and genetic tool building, our team is uniquely positioned to address these aims and make significant
contributions to our understanding of the cell biological mechanisms that control myelin remodeling and its role
in learning. Approaches used in this proposal will build a platform from which additional molecular mechanisms
of myelin plasticity can be evaluated. These studies will thus provide important, novel insights into mechanisms
underlying brain plasticity and may lead to therapies to promote the regeneration of lost myelin and recovery of
function in diseases like multiple sclerosis and after stroke."

Fibrosis is defined as excess deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), resulting in tissue scarring and organ
dysfunction. In the heart, fibrotic remodeling in the context of chronic comorbidities such as hypertension and
metabolic disease is associated with increased passive myocardial stiffness and the development of diastolic
dysfunction (DD), a contributor to the pathogenesis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The
adult heart contains resident cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), which, in response to stress, undergo a cell state transition
to become activated fibroblasts, sometimes referred to as myofibroblasts. Activated CFs are characterized by
transcriptional reprogramming that results in enhanced production and secretion of fibrotic ECM proteins.
Despite the well-recognized roles of CFs in fibrotic remodeling of the heart, there are no targeted therapies to
prevent or reverse the phenotypic conversion of these cells into an activated state.
Recently, we demonstrated that inhibition of the eicosanoid-degrading enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin
dehydrogenase (15-PGDH), using SW033291, potently suppresses murine and human CF activation, and blocks
cardiac fibrosis and ameliorates DD in vivo in mice. Eicosanoids are 20 carbon-containing lipid signaling
molecules that are produced by a variety of cells. Our data support a model in which stress signals trigger 15-
PGDH-mediated degradation of eicosanoids in CFs, resulting in reduced ERK1/2 signaling and subsequent
activation of the cells to promote fibrosis. SW033291 treatment prevents degradation of eicosanoids, resulting
in increased secretion of these fatty acids, which function in an autocrine and paracrine manner to promote
antifibrotic ERK signaling in CFs and ameliorate fibrosis of the heart. Three specific aims are designed to extend
this new field of cardiac research and test the overall hypothesis that inhibition of 15-PGDH promotes signaling
events that prevent and reverse the transcriptional reprogramming that typically culminates in CF activation and
pathological fibrosis of the heart."
10990047,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endolysosomal dysfunction is a convergent mechanism in many brain disorders. We are studying genetic con-
ditions caused by mutations in the endosomal Na+/H+ Exchanger 6 (NHE6). Through our work with affected
families in the International Christianson Syndrome and NHE6 Gene Network Study, we have found three phe-
notypes associated with NHE6 mutations: 1) Christianson Syndrome (CS), a profound intellectual disability af-
fecting males with loss-of-function mutations; 2) the Female-specific NHE6 Mutation Carrier Syndrome (FCS);
and 3) Non-Syndromic ID/Autism (NS-ID/ASD) which occurs in males who carry putative hypomorphic muta-
tions in NHE6. The objective of this R01 renewal proposal is to define pathogenic mechanisms that cause
NHE6-related disease, as well as to develop mechanistic linkages to other related developmental and degen-
erative disorders. We find a high degree of relevance to Lysosome Disorders, as well as, Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD). Our central hypothesis is that loss of NHE6 leads to abnormal endo-
some-lysosome fusion, thereby causing: 1) cell-autonomous defects, such as aberrant retrograde axonal
transport and lysosomal deficiency; and 2) cell non-autonomous pathology, such as toxic exosome release,
and activation of disease-associated glial. Our research team is in an excellent position to study NHE6-related
disease bench-to-bedside. We have unique resources, including: NHE6 mutant mice and human stem cells; as
well as an NHE6-null rat that shows endogenous tauopathy. We also have a long-standing relationship with the
family-led Christianson Syndrome Association, as we lead the natural history studies. There are four Aims: Aim
1 focuses on defining the molecular mechanism whereby loss of NHE6 leads to an endosome-lysosome fusion
defect. In Aim 2, we define molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of disease-associated astrocytes
and microglia in NHE6-mutant brains. The impact of this Aim, in part, involves the strong overlap of disease-
associated glial states with AD/ADRD. In Aim 3, we will define the mechanism whereby putative hypomorphic
NHE6 mutations in patients with NS-ID/ASD cause developmental delays and behavioral regressions. In this
Aim, we will dissect biological mechanisms in developmental regression, which are common but have re-
mained largely undefined. In Aim 4, we will focus on FCS, and define potential cell non-autonomous disease
mechanisms in female NHE6 mutation carriers, including assessment of tau toxicity. In this Aim, through study
of patient-derived iPSCs and the female carrier rat, we will contribute to knowledge of the understudied female
carrier syndrome, and also to elucidating disease mechanisms related to X-chromosome inactivation in female
brain. Overall, this research will define mechanisms in new genetic diseases in males and females, and will
establish linkages with more common disorders, including AD/ADRD, potentially identifying new therapeutic
targets. Additionally, our research uses a powerful integrated translational approach, bridging patient-oriented
studies to experimental models, thereby contributing to robust research outcomes with high societal impact."
10990721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pulmonary fibrosis is a complex disease that limits lung function through development of collagen-rich
scar tissue. Although there are currently two FDA-approved therapies for fibrosis patients, these drugs are
capable of extending life only months and do not reverse the progression of the disease. The research described
in this proposal would build upon evidence that reprogramming cellular fate through modulation of the
epigenetic enzyme EZH2 can ameliorate several phenotypes of pulmonary fibrosis, including aberrant
alveolar cell fate and pro-fibrotic cytokine signaling. Specifically, the aims will test if the FDA-approved EZH2
inhibitor, tazemetostat, will allow for prevention or reversion of these cellular phenotypes. The model systems to
be used include both human and mouse organotypic cell cultures and two established in vivo models of
pulmonary fibrosis, namely lung instillation of the chemotherapy bleomycin or adeno-associated virus (AAV)
expressing TGFβ. For Aim 1, we will quantify the extent of aberrant basaloid/alveolar transition cells in lung
epithelial cultures that are depleted for EZH2 activity genetically or pharmacologically, and assess rescue of this
phenotype by deletion of the transcription factor FOXP2. FOXP2 deletion and knock-down will also be used to
understand this important transcription factor’s role alveolar cell fate. We will also assess the down-regulation of
IL1β by EZH2 inhibition, and its effects on both murine and human epithelial and fibroblast cells. The influence
of TGFβ on fibroblasts and epithelial cells in the presence of EZH2 inhibitor will be tested. In Aim 2 in vivo lung
injury models will be used to examine both prevention and treatment of lung fibrosis, and to characterize specific
changes to the epithelial, fibroblast, and myeloid cell populations driven by EZH2 inhibition. Lung function
testing, histology, scRNA-seq and flow cytometry will be used to characterize the lung phenotypes. Patient
tissues will be used to understand if EZH2 activity is high and FOXP2 expression is low in aberrant
basaloid/alveolar transition cells in vivo. We expect that this research could validate the use of EZH2 inhibition
as a treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, and will expand our knowledge in the field of lung epigenetics and stem
cell biology."
10992795,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represents 10 to 20% of all dementia cases. GRN mutations account for up to
20 percent of familial and 5 percent of sporadic FTD. Homozygous GRN mutations cause the rare lysosomal
storage disease ceroid lipofuscinosis. Dysfunctional lysosomal degradation pathways due to reduced granulin
function can lead to TDP-43 proteinopathy. TDP-43 has been implicated in regulating transcription, alternative
splicing, and mRNA stability. GRN-FTD manifests as the behavioral variant (bvFTD), primary progressive
aphasia, and movement disorders with extrapyramidal features such as parkinsonism and corticobasal
syndrome. It is unknown what brain circuits cause motor symptoms and aphasia in GRN-FTD patients. Basal
ganglia are involved in both motor and language functions. It is unknown whether and how GRN mutation
affects basal ganglia, leading to motor symptoms and aphasia. We obtained a line of Grn (mouse homolog of
human GRN) knockin (KI) mice with the most common GRN-FTD mutation found in human patients.
Preliminary studies of Grn KI mice showed earlier onset motor coordination and balance deficits, accompanied
by altered firing patterns of striatal neurons. Our long-term goal is to use mouse models to elucidate the
pathophysiology of motor symptoms and language deficits associated with FTD. The specific objective of this
proposal is to determine the effect of Grn knockout restricted to the striatum on motor and non-motor
symptoms in mice. We hypothesize that heterozygous striatum-specific loss of function of the progranulin
protein leads to TDP-43 proteinopathy and reduced hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)
mRNA and protein expression, in turn results in motor and communication deficits accompanied by anatomical
and functional deficits in the basal ganglia, especially in the striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) and medium
spiny neurons (MSNs). The rationale for the proposed research is that once the mechanisms of the altered
striatal neurons and motor and aphasia symptoms in FTD are clarified, novel therapeutics can be developed to
treat motor and non-motor symptoms in FTD patients. We plan to test our hypothesis with the following
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that the heterozygous striatum-specific Grn knockout mice have
deficits both in motor and non-motor behaviors, we will examine the mutant mice with a behavioral test battery.
Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that altered striatal neurons in the heterozygous striatum-specific Grn knockout
mice contribute to motor and non-motor symptoms in FTD, we will a) quantify the number of striatal ChIs by
immunohistochemistry, b) analyze the in vitro activity and morphology of striatal neurons, and c) quantify
proteins involved in striatal cholinergic metabolism and HCN expression. The successful completion of the
above aims will allow us to determine how the altered properties of striatal neurons can lead to motor
dysfunction and aphasia in FTD. Characterizing these neurons will provide novel targets for treatment and offer
great promise for developing targeted therapies for motor dysfunction and aphasia associated with FTD."
10993269,"ABSTRACT: Although schizophrenia (SCZ) is highly heritable, the genetic underpinnings of SCZ are largely
unknown. Over the last decade, genome wide association (GWA) studies have made huge strides in identifying
non-coding loci associated with increased risk of SCZ. However, our ability to interpret this data and identify
causal variants has significantly lagged behind our ability to identify associations with this disorder. Work in our
lab utilizes CRISPR-Cas9 technologies to dissect disease-associated variants and loci at large scale to
determine if they function in gene regulation. Our current goal is to utilize high-throughput CRISPR screens to
characterize SCZ-associated variants that map within regulatory elements and link them to their target genes.
This proposal outlines the use of epigenetic CRISPR screens to dissect SCZ-associated loci that have been
detected by both common variant GWA and rare variant whole exome sequencing (WES) studies, as well as loci
that contain a single gene. Successful completion of this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of SCZ
GWA regions and will provide an optimized strategy for tackling complex disease genetics."
10993429,"Fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are killing thousands of Americans each year. The overall goal of this
research is to better understand the role of the primary central noradrenergic system in fentanyl withdrawal. We
have known for decades that increased locus coeruleus-noradrenergic (LC-NE) system activity is critically
involved in both stress-induced increases negative affect and is potently modulated by withdrawal from opioids.
However, there is extensive, long-term controversy over the contribution of the LC-NE system to opioid
withdrawal-related behaviors. Critically, opioid withdrawal increases glutamate efflux into the locus coeruleus.
This fundamental feature of opioid withdrawal was identified and rigorously studied for many years, generating
potential therapeutic interventions that never reached the clinic. Study on this topic went largely quiet after lesions
studies indicated an intact LC-NE system was not necessary for the withdrawal-induced place aversion or
somatic signs of withdrawal. Despite these important findings, relatively little is known about afferent
glutamatergic regulation of LC-NE neurons in opioid withdrawal-induced negative affect. We will determine
whether a newly identified midbrain glutamatergic input to LC-NE neurons contributes to negative affective
behaviors associated with opioid withdrawal. We have now identified a largely unstudied afferent projection to
the LC from excitatory neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region critical for processing reward and
motivation. While projections from these glutamatergic VTA neurons to the nucleus accumbens and lateral
habenula have opposing valences on aversion in mouse models, we hypothesize that VTA glutamate projections
to the LC-NE system produce negative affect and will be modulated by opioid withdrawal. Our preliminary
electrophysiology data suggests that this glutamatergic input to the LC amplifies other sources of glutamate. In
this proposal, we begin by seeking to determine whether withdrawal from fentanyl selectively modifies this
excitatory input the LC compared to other well-established excitatory inputs. Here, we will use brain slice
electrophysiology and in vivo microdialysis to test the hypothesis that excitatory VTA-LC activity is selectively
enhanced in opioid withdrawal. In the second aim, we will conduct behavioral studies modulating this excitatory
VTA-LC projection to determine whether it is needed for natural avoidance behaviors that guide actions away
from risk. Our preliminary data shows these behaviors that are amplified following fentanyl withdrawal. Together
these experiments will generate previously unattainable information about fentanyl-induced plasticity in VTA
glutamate inputs to LC-NE neurons and the negative affective behaviors these neurons generate. These studies
will clarify function of the excitatory VTA-LC projection by determining 1) whether fentanyl withdrawal alters their
input to the LC-NE system and 2) their role in fentanyl withdrawal-induced avoidance behaviors. This information
will be critical for translational research targeting noradrenergic and/or glutamate systems in the treatment of
opioid withdrawal and related neuropsychiatric disorders."
10995258,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Transgender Veterans die by suicide at twice the rate of cisgender (non-transgender) Veterans.
Depression is a risk factor for suicide. Neither the mental healthcare utilization patterns of transgender
Veterans with depression, nor the barriers to care experienced by these Veterans, are well understood.
Significance/Impact: A 2018 VA directive, Providing Health Care for Transgender Veterans, affirmed the VA’s
commitment to addressing health disparities among transgender Veterans. As the number of transgender
Veterans increases, so too, does the importance of this commitment. Addressing the mental health needs of
transgender Veterans is timely, given the high prevalence of depression and suicidality in this population. The
results of this pilot will inform efforts to meet the goals of the directive.
Innovation: This pilot study will be the first study to describe the mental healthcare utilization patterns of
transgender Veterans with depression using VA data. It is innovative in its focus on a marginalized population
for whom the barriers to, and utilization of, mental healthcare, have not been well understood. Furthermore, it
is innovative in its examination of potential of communication technology to address barriers to care.
Specific Aims The proposed work has the following three specific aims.
Aim 1: Characterize mental health utilization patterns of transgender Veterans diagnosed with
depression. We will identify and compare the mental healthcare utilization rates of transgender Veterans with
depression and a matched cohort of cisgender Veterans with depression.
Aim 2: Identify and describe the facilitators and barriers for transgender Veterans in accessing
depression treatment, and their experiences using communication technology to access or coordinate
related care. We will conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews with transgender patients to understand
their care experiences, and the role that communication technology plays, if any, in those experiences.
Aim 3: Design and plan an intervention to overcome barriers to mental healthcare for transgender
Veterans with depression. We will elicit iterative feedback from key stakeholder groups to inform the design
of a strategy to address barriers identified in Aim 2.
Methodology: This project has a mixed-methods design. In Aim 1, the mental healthcare utilization patterns of
transgender and cisgender patients diagnosed with depression will be compared. In Aim 2, we will elicit the
perspectives and experiences of transgender Veterans with depression, to inform the patterns we observe in
Aim 1, and conduct in-depth interviews to contextualize the care-seeking experiences of transgender Veterans
with depression, to identify and understand their facilitators and barriers to care. In Aim 3, the quantitative
results of Aim 1 and the qualitative results of Aim 2 will be integrated and incorporated into the design of an
intervention strategy sensitive to the needs of this population.
Implementation/next steps: The expected outcome of this pilot will be the formulation of an intervention
strategy to address an important barrier to depression care for transgender Veterans. Following successful
completion of Aim 3, we expect to pursue funding to test and then expand the intervention, and evaluate its
efficacy."
10996575,"ABSTRACT
Natural killer (NK) cells are key mediators of anti-tumor immune responses, acting to directly kill cancer cells
(CD56dim subtype) and recruit pro-inflammatory immune populations (CD56bright subtype). Recent discoveries,
however, have revealed other NK cell subtypes with properties of tissue-resident and adaptive, memory-like
phenotypes. Tissue-resident NK cells have been shown to have elevated production of chemokines, such as
CCL3 and XCL1 that, in turn, recruit conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) and CD8+ T cells to tumors.
Adaptive NK cells have been shown to persist for months longer than conventional NK cells and display
enhanced tumor cell killing. Given the diversity of the NK cell repertoire, it is crucial to identify which NK cell
subtypes exist in tumors and are key to anti-tumor responses. To address this, our group has generated a pan-
cancer atlas of NK cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from 326 patients across 17 cancer types. In
doing so, we identified prominent populations of CD56bright NK cells that display gene signatures suggestive of
both tissue-resident and adaptive NK phenotypes (bright-taNKs). We found bright-taNKs to display higher
expression of chemokines and cytokines, such as CCL3, XCL1, and IFNG, suggesting a functional role in
immune cell recruitment to tumors. Using a gene signature to estimate the relative abundance of bright-taNKs
in bulk RNA-seq data, we found that bright-taNKs are associated with significantly longer disease-free survival
in cancer patients. Thus, bright-taNKs may be critical for anti-tumor immunity and represent attractive
phenotypes to mimic for the next generation of engineered NK cell therapies. As little is currently known about
bright-taNKs, this proposal aims to advance our understanding of the functions of bright-taNKs in tumors and
identify mechanisms promoting their distinct phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will use orthogonal methods to determine
whether bright-taNK populations are associated with increased recruitment of anti-tumor immune populations,
such as cDC1s and CD8+ T cells. We will develop a bioinformatics tool that can be paired with well-established
tools to estimate fractions of different NK cell subtypes and other immune cell types in bulk RNA-seq data.
Additionally, we will apply highly-multiplexed spatial imaging tools to interrogate the spatial distribution of bright-
taNKs, and other NK cell populations, in tumors and their associations with other immune cell types. In Aim 2,
we will use gene delivery platforms to screen for transcription factors that promote features of tissue-resident
and adaptive phenotypes in CD56bright NK cells. We will then transition the most promising gene targets to our
clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem cell to NK cell (iNK) platform to holistically evaluate the effects on anti-
tumor functions. Altogether, this proposal aims to advance our understanding of bright-taNKs, and other NK cell
subtypes, in tumors. Ultimately, drivers of favorable NK cell properties can be readily integrated into our group’s
bench-to-bedside pipeline for NK cell therapies to enhance their efficacy and durability."
11000602,"Project Summary/Abstract
The aging brain is increasingly susceptible to cognitive decline and dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a main
form of dementia, is an extreme, pathological manifestation of brain aging. However, the etiology and
pathogenesis of AD are not well understood, causing the dearth of effective treatments. Mounting evidence has
implicated epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, in neuronal aging and
degeneration, raising the hypothesis that resetting these epigenetic changes and restoring a youthful epigenome
may increase neuroplasticity and forestall disease. We have recently discovered that epigenetic reprogramming
by coexpression of three Yamanaka factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (OSK), can induce axon regeneration in retinal
ganglion cells (RGCs), a type of central nervous system (CNS) neuron, after acute injury. Furthermore, OSK
expression in RGCs of old mice reversed aging-associated transcriptome changes, reset the DNA methylation
age of the cells, and restored vision to a level similar to young mice, suggesting neuronal rejuvenation.
Importantly, cell cycle, cell identity, and intrinsic electrophysiological properties of postmitotic neurons were not
affected by OSK reprogramming. In this proposal, I seek to identify the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie
OSK-mediated axon regeneration (Aim 1), determine whether epigenetic reprogramming in brain neurons
reverses age-associated cognitive decline and epigenomic changes (Aim 2), and investigate the role of
epigenetic changes in the progression of AD (Aim 3). A new mouse model that allows temporal control of
epigenetic reprogramming in the forebrain neurons will be used to evaluate the therapeutic effect of epigenetic
reprogramming in AD through a combination of molecular, physiological, behavioral, and histological techniques.
Based on our preliminary results, I hypothesize that reversal of the aging epigenome in CNS neurons will improve
neuronal plasticity and restore cognitive function that are impaired due to aging and Alzheimer’s disease. This
work will provide novel insights into the etiology of AD, identify the epigenetic links between aging and AD, and
may reveal a new realm of therapeutics. Aims 1 and 2 will be performed predominantly during the K99 phase
under the mentorship of Dr. David Sinclair, a leader in aging and epigenetics; Dr. Edward Boyden, a world-
renowned neuroscientist; and Dr. Steve Horvath, an expert in DNA methylation and aging. Aim 3 will be
performed predominantly during the R00 phase. The mentorship program and proposed research will allow me
to gain rigorous scientific training in neuroscience and bioinformatics, specializing in neurodegeneration,
neurophysiology, and genome-wide epigenetic analysis. In addition, in conducting the K99 phase at Harvard
Medical School, my work will benefit from the highly collaborative research environment, state-of-the-art
technologies and facilities, and world-renowned experts available for collaboration and consultation. The award
will enable an in-depth career development plan for me to expand the scope of my research and launch an
independent research program focused on studying epigenetic mechanisms of neuronal aging and degeneration."
10985367,"SUMMARY
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide. In the vast majority of patients, AD
develops sporadically in the absence of any known etiology other than advanced age and is further influenced
by a plethora of etiological mechanisms. Old age stands out as the most important risk factor for the
development of AD in most cases. The first pathological events leading to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) start
many years before the onset of symptoms. Identification of the mechanisms that cause MCI, and those that
trigger the conversion of MCI to AD, are of major interest, as they promise strong therapeutic benefit via halting
or slowing disease progression. However, a much better understanding of how the multiple heterogenous risk
factors for MCI/AD, which include polygenic risk variants and biological aging, converge on key molecular
pathways that initiate and drive MCI are needed.
 The teams around Dr. Mertens have established that direct conversion of human patient fibroblasts into
induced neurons (iNs) preserves signatures of cell aging and sporadic AD, and allows for the detection of
cellular pathologies and disease drivers. Patient-derived iNs reflect an adult-like neuronal identity, and they
stand out as a unique and complementary model system to animal and iPSC-based models to study the age-
dependent pathogenesis of MCI/AD. Importantly, patient-specific iNs capture the strongest risk factors, the
genetic makeup and the biological age, of a patient at a given stage, and we here harness MCI patient iNs as a
disease stage-specific model system to investigate the early trajectory of MCI/AD in human neurons.
 Preliminary evidence indicates marked MCI-related signatures in iNs that intersect with the
transcriptomic, epigenetic, and metabolic signatures of accelerated aging, and partially overlap with signatures
of AD iNs. This project will integrate polygenetic risk scores for AD with deep and unbiased multi-omic
phenotyping, and will assess effects of impaired MCI neurons on human astrocytes and microglia in 3D
microcarrier-based co-cultures. The teams will further assess how the underlying epigenetic landscapes and
DNA binding patterns of disease factors associate with age acceleration and MCI neuronal phenotypes, and will
provide a deep functional characterization of the cells. The goal is to better understand early MCI/AD disease
ethology, and to exploit the comprehensive multi-layered information emerging from this project for new
treatment strategies."

10980716,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Loss of vestibular function causes visuospatial misperception, imbalance, and decreased visual acuity during
head motion, leading to severe impairment of daily activities. Vestibular rehabilitation therapy is the standard of
care for treating these associated symptoms, but it is not universally effective and there are no objective means
for identifying mechanisms that contribute to the recovery when it is successful. Following loss of vestibular
function, each patient may have a distinct predisposition toward relying on one or another sensory modality (e.g.,
vision or somatosensory inputs), or may adopt a different strategy to cope with the aberrant vestibular information
(e.g., blink during head rotation). These intricate responses can result in different patterns of sensorimotor
reorganization during recovery. Another major constraint rerated to vestibular recovery is the lack of objective
assessments of otolith and semicircular canal function, as the current outcome measures instead rely on the
clinician judgment. Such lack of quantitative measures of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and other sensory
substitutions preclude the ability to predict functional outcomes and identify those patients who could benefit
most from rehabilitation. To address this issue, the objective of this project is to examine whether novel video-
oculography (VOG) measures of the VOR can be used as valid markers of functional outcome following
vestibular loss. To this end, we will use the video head impulse test (vHIT) to measure semicircular canal
function. For assessment of the otolith function, we have developed a VOG method based on ocular counter-roll
(vOCR), during which the torsional VOR is quantified with lateral head tilt.
Our preliminary results show recovery in vOCR with vestibular compensation over time, whereas the VOR gain
as measured by vHIT remains abnormal in all stages of recovery following vestibular loss. Some patients
however generate compensatory saccades that conceal their VOR deficit, suggesting a saccade strategy that
may be related to the adequacy of vestibular compensation. In addition, we have found that the difference in
vOCR during en bloc head-and-body tilt versus head-only tilt can be used as a measure of sensory substitution
for vestibular loss during recovery. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that vOCR with whole-
body/head-only tilt and compensatory saccades with vHIT can be used as novel markers to (i) measure recovery
and (ii) predict functional outcomes following vestibular loss. We expect that the findings in this project will also
provide the basis for a future grant that investigates customized vestibular rehabilitation using discrete and easy-
to-apply VOG measurements in individual patients rather than applying a fixed treatment protocol in all patients."
10981647,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since the 1990s, pediatric oncology has made sustained strides in understanding the biology that drives
children’s cancers, but these understandings have not yielded significant therapeutic gains. Approximately 20%
of children diagnosed with cancer today are not cured with current standard regimens and cancer remains the
leading cause of disease related death in children in the US and other high-income countries. Nearly all current
standard treatments are cytotoxic regimens, which are associated with shortened lifespans, high rates of severe
late effects and second malignancies and diminished quality of life. There is an urgent need to develop safer and
more effective, targeted therapeutics for treatment of children’s cancers. During the last three decades, the
Mackall lab has made sustained contributions to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that
immunotherapies can selectively target even the most aggressive cancers, raising the prospect that
immunotherapies specifically designed for children’s cancers could improve cure rates and diminish toxicity.
This program will build upon deep understandings of fundamental cellular and molecular immunology in the
Mackall lab and recent progress in defining mechanisms of immune evasion and resistance to current
immunotherapies to create next generation immunotherapies for children’s cancer that manifest enhanced safety
and potency and potentially enhance access to patients. We will leverage a surfeit of emerging synthetic biology
and protein engineering platforms emanating from scientific labs at Stanford University which have been, and
continue to be, integrated into the Mackall laboratory. This work will occur within the enabling ecosystem
provided by the Stanford Center for Cancer Cell Therapy, which is led by the PI and supports infrastructure to
enable rapid forward and reverse translation of promising therapeutics. Areas of focus will include, but are not
limited to, developing new approaches to overcome the suppressive tumor microenvironment in pediatric solid
tumors, optimizing multi-specific CAR T cells, using combinatorial engineering to create uber potent T cells while
enhancing understanding of toxicities that may limit application of these enhancements. We also will enter the
promising new arena of in vivo gene delivery to engineer immune populations without the need for cumbersome
and expensive ex vivo manufacturing. We have already demonstrated expertise in utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 for
screens and therapeutic manipulation and are routinely employing synthetic biology technologies including
CRISPR/Cas13 to regulate RNA, base editing to knockout genes without double strand breaks, mutagenesis
combined with yeast display to create proteins with unique and specific properties, drug regulatable platforms to
control protein expression and viral free cell engineering. Biopharma does not prioritize development of
therapeutics for children’s cancers, and thus this Program addresses a critical unmet need to leverage the latest
advances to develop more effective and less toxic immunotherapies for children’s cancers."
10981709,"Summary: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 10% of the world’s population and is characterized by
progressive fibrosis and loss of kidney function, leading to end stage renal disease. Effective therapies to prevent
or curtail the advancement of fibrosis remains a major clinical challenge. Kidney proximal tubule cells (PTC)
have the remarkable ability to respond to injury by entering an earlier developmental state, termed
dedifferentiation, and dividing to replace lost cells. PTCs then redifferentiate to resume normal function. For over
100 years, however, it has been known that a subset of PTCs never fully redifferentiate, and these chronically
injured PTCs are a main driver of fibrosis and CDK progression. Although recent studies have better
characterized these cells, it remains unclear why these chronically injured PTCs can’t recover from injury, while
neighboring cells can. In studies funded by this award, we made a breakthrough by discovering key players that
regulate G2/M arrest, dedifferentiation, senescence and fibrosis in CKD, the atypical cyclin, cyclin G1, and its
cyclin dependent kinase (CDK5). Using cyclin G1 or CDK5 knockout kidneys as tools, we experimentally
dissected G2/M arrest from dedifferentiation and fibrosis. Surprisingly, we found that while G2/M arrest was more
common in maladaptively repaired cells, its functional role in CKD progression was limited. Instead, we
discovered cyclin G1/CDK5 induced a state of profibrotic dedifferentiation that led to senescence and CKD we
termed ‘maladaptive dedifferentiation.’ In the current proposal, we aim to test the therapeutic potential of
redifferentiating maladaptively dedifferentiated cells. In our preliminary data we found that the cyclin G1/CDK5
pathway regulates dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) mediated mitochondrial fission. In vitro, we discovered that
maladaptive dedifferentiation could be reversed by targeting the cyclin G1/CDK5 pathway or mitochondrial
dysfunction via Drp1. If the PTCs progressed to senescence, however, they became much harder to
redifferentiate. Importantly, these findings translated in vivo. In animal models we found selective deletion of
Drp1 after recovery from AKI induced redifferentiation and prevented senescence. These data indicate that
redifferentiation of maladaptively repaired PTC is possible. Based on these data, cyclin G1/CDK5-induced
mitochondrial dysfunction promotes and extends maladaptive dedifferentiation in PTCs, preventing
redifferentiation and promoting irreversible senescence. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1. Determine the ‘point-
of-no-return’ for PTC redifferentiation. We will test if and when targeting the cyclin G1/CDK5 pathway promotes
redifferentiation and prevents AKI-to-CKD transition using Cre promotors to target dedifferentiated or senescent
cells specifically. 2. Determine if restoration of mitochondrial morphology is necessary for PTC redifferentiation.
Using conditional knockout mice, specific inhibitors, and metabolic flux assays we will examine whether
restoration of FAO promotes redifferentiation. This proposal represents a new direction for the field of CKD
research by directly targeting the maladaptive dedifferentiated PTCs with redifferentiation therapies."
10982137,"A process of cell competition can remove cells that differ genetically from neighboring
cells in the same tissues. Cell competition helps to eliminate sporadic aneuploid cells
that have abnormal chromosome numbers. Aneuploidy contributes to almost all
carcinogenesis and is a hallmark of aging, contributing to cellular senescence. The
current project investigates the mechanisms by which genes that encode ribosomal
proteins, by virtue of their wide distribution in the genome and stoichiometric
requirement for ribosome biogenesis, are used as sensors for altered cellular
chromosome content, using fruitflies as a genetic model system. Importantly, cells with
single mutations in ribosomal protein genes can also be recognized and removed from
developing tissues by the process of cell competition with nearby normal cells, related
to the elimination of aneuploid cells. This project will further define the molecular
mechanisms of cell competition pathways by gain and loss of function genetics targeted
specifically to aneuploid cells within otherwise normal tissues, and characterize the
alterations in gene expression that result from cell competition on a single cell level.
The relationship of specific chromosome gains and losses to tumor formation will be
defined. The mechanisms whereby the p53 protein protects the genome from
progressive genome damage, and the route by which genomic changes accumulate in
the progression towards cancer, will be elucidated. These studies aim to define the
molecular basis for the cellular recognition and elimination of aneuploid cells in
developing tissues, its role in maintaining genome integrity at the tissue level by
selection against abnormal cells, and its role in tumor surveillance and the development
of cancers."
10981475,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission, underlie high cognitive
processes, and contribute to nearly all aspects of the central nervous system (CNS) development and function.
The fastest iGluRs, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors (KARs), play key roles in generation of
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), regulation of synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter release, and
nervous system development. They are also implicated in numerous psychiatric, neurological, and
neurodegenerative diseases, including epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, schizophrenia, obsessive-
compulsive, mood and bipolar disorders, mental retardation, depression, autism, Huntington's and Alzheimer’s
diseases, ischemia, and pain. However, development of drugs targeting AMPARs and KARs has been
hindered by limited knowledge about their structure and function. For example, most published structures of
AMPARs and KARs are structures of homotetrameric receptors, while the overwhelming majority of iGluRs in
the CNS are heterotetramers. Several noncompetitive inhibitors and ion channel blockers of AMPARs and
KARs have been identified as promising candidates for drug development but structural mechanisms of their
action remain poorly understood. This missing information is absolutely critical for the future structure-based
rational drug design. We plan to study the structure and function of AMPARs and KARs using a combination of
biophysical and biochemical approaches, including modern cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques,
fluorescence-based methods, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology. Our specific aims are to (1) determine
structures of heteromeric iGluRs, (2) uncover the molecular basis of noncompetitive inhibition, and (3)
establish the structural mechanisms of ion channel block. To reach our research goals, we will optimize
AMPAR and KAR constructs for cryo-EM experiments, develop protocols of their expression and purification
and solve structures of heterotetrameric receptors, with or without auxiliary subunits, in complex with
noncompetitive inhibitors or ion channel blockers. We will test our models using a combination of mutagenesis
and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We will combine the results of structural, functional and mutagenesis
experiments to propose molecular models of iGluR heteromeric assembly, noncompetitive inhibition, and ion
channel block. Reaching our research goals will provide molecular level knowledge essential for the design of
new molecules that can become safe and efficacious drugs for treatment of epilepsy and other disorders
associated with excitatory neurotransmission."
10982340,"A simple arithmetic of life is this: if cells in a tissue divide more frequently than they die, the tissue grows; if
cells die more frequently than they divide, the tissue shrinks. This basic principle is enshrined as a “hallmark”
of cancer—for a cancer to exist it must evade cell death mechanisms that would shift this equation to attrition.
For three decades my laboratory has worked to understand the core pathways of regulated cell death and how
they are controlled at the molecular level. This program of research, the continuation of which is proposed in
this application, explores the processes of regulated cell death in the forms of apoptosis and necroptosis, and
seeks to understand how they are tied to other cellular physiologies, as they must be. Three general goals of
this research are outlined as questions, as follows. A. What are the mechanisms of cell survival in
apoptosis/necroptosis and how do these integrate with cell life? Here we use the concept of “flatliners,” cells
that survive the activation of core apoptotic or necroptotic pathways, to probe the pathways that, when
engaged, restrict these core pathways to enable transient resistance to this and subsequent stimuli. We have
found that cancer cell survivors of the apoptotic pathway display increased aggressiveness in vivo and we
have found signatures of these cells in minimal residual disease. Our flatliners are tested in cancer allograft
and xenograft models. We will extend our studies to cells that survive necroptosis. B. What are the
consequences of surviving a cellular “near death experience (flatlining)? Cells that survive engagement of a
cell death pathway (flatliners) resemble, in all aspects, cancer persister cells that survive a therapeutic
treatment without selection for resistance mutations. While the definitions are distinct, we propose that flatliners
can take on the properties of persisters. These include genomic stability. We have found that Gasdermin E, a
caspase substrate that causes lytic cell death, limits the generation of flatliners, and thus prevents caspase-
induced DNA damage and mutation, with consquences for human cancers. C. How do diverse processes of
cellular life integrate with the mechanisms of necroptosis? Necroptosis is a form of regulated necrosis that is
actively inhibited by the action of a caspase, normally associated with apoptosis (but here with cell survival).
We will continue our studies into regulation of necroptosis in relation to cellular physiology and develop tools to
probe its activation in the context of cancer and other pathologies. Surviving necroptosis involves repairing
membrane damage inflicted by the necroptosis process (a function of ESCRT) and reversing the activation of
its executioner. While the understanding of the core pathways of cell death have led to one approved cancer
therapeutic, our continued “life and death” efforts set the stage for future success in this critical arena."

The brain shows marked plasticity across a variety of learning and memory tasks as well as during
recovery after injury. Many have proposed to leverage this innate plasticity using brain stimulation
to treat neural disorders. Implementing such treatments requires advanced engineering tools as
well as a solid understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network
dynamics and connectivity at a large scale and across multiple brain areas. Here, I propose to
use our novel engineering tools to precisely manipulate neural activity in macaque sensorimotor
cortex to investigate and induce targeted cortical reorganization. I hypothesize that a closed-loop
optogenetic stimulation of somatosensory cortex based on the natural functional connectivity of
the sensorimotor system can drive cortical plasticity and induce functional recovery. The
functional connectivity maps of the somatosensory and motor cortical areas will be estimated as
a guide for targeted stimulation. In Aim 1 the effectiveness of volitional control of activity-
dependent stimulation will be investigated to both strengthen the natural existing connections and
to induce new connections. In Aim 2 the volitional control of activity-dependent stimulation will
be evaluated to induce new connections in the presence of an ischemic lesion. These aims are
designed to provide us with both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to assess the
targeted cortical reorganization. The combination of these measures can shed light on different
aspects of brain plasticity and functional recovery mechanisms. The results of these aims will be
a proof of concept for the power of refined stimulation patterns for targeted rehabilitation and
rewiring of the brain that not only can be used for neurorehabilitation but also can help understand
the circuits and connectivity in these cortical areas."
10993053,"Project Summary/Abstract
Malignant tumors escape immune surveillance by evading, suppressing, or distorting immune function. The
recent success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy relies on targeting suppressive mechanisms affecting
effector function of cytotoxic T cells. However, the majority (60%) of patients with advanced melanoma fail to
respond to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, and many of those that do respond ultimately go on to
develop resistance and disease progression.
While the ability to promote immune responses to tumor has largely focused on tumor specific factors (e.g.
tumor mutational burden), variability in the host immune repertoire may also explain the heterogeneity of
responses seen from ICI treatment failure. ICI therapy works through multiple pathways to release the
immunosuppressive brake on innate and adaptive immune cells. A very important mechanism of action of ICI is
the targeting of inhibitory receptors on CD8+ T cells, which potentiates effector anti-tumor CD8+ T cell function.
Although ICI can renew the effector function of CD8+ T cells, most patients with metastatic melanoma do not
respond to checkpoint blockade due multiple mechanisms spanning both adaptive and innate immunity. A
recently described cell population, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), are present in secondary lymphoid organs,
peripheral blood, and tissue, and have been described to modulate adaptive immune responses. Type 3 ILCs
(ILC3s) can create immunosuppressive microenvironments through the secretion of Interleukin-17 (IL-17)
leads to the recruitment of immunosuppressive cell populations and creation of an immunosuppressive
microenvironment. ILC3s are the “first responders” to inflammation/tumor and dictate further innate and
adaptive responses that may ultimately determine effectiveness of ICI therapy. However, the role of ILC3s in
the mechanisms behind ICI failure and CD8+ T cell activation is currently not well understood. The ability to
more specifically define the function of ILC3s in the melanoma tumor microenvironment (TME) has the
potential to inform novel combination treatment strategies and dictate the downstream innate and adaptive
cellular responses that drive ICI therapy effectiveness. However, this is currently not well understood."

Falls are a significant concern in persons with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS) leading to adverse health outcomes
and a diminished quality of life. Fear of falling (FOF) is a heightened emotional response to the possibility of
losing balance, accompanied by an inclination to avoid such situations. FOF impacts over 60% of pwMS and
traps individuals in a vicious cycle of reduced balance confidence, avoidance behavior, physical deconditioning,
and subsequent increased fall risk. The FOF cycle leads to downstream negative consequences in cognition,
social isolation, psychological distress, and overall life quality. Therefore, FOF is viewed as a complex construct
associated with motor, cognitive, and psychological factors; however, the neural correlates remain largely
unknown. While limited research has explored neural underpinnings of FOF in healthy older adults, it primarily
focused on brain regions related to general motor function, neglecting associations with regions underlying
cognitive and emotional functions. Intriguingly, the association between FOF and motor regions among older
adults is partially dependent on neuroticism and anxiety, underscoring the multifactorial nature of FOF. These
neural and psychological contributors to FOF are understudied in pwMS. Without a comprehensive
understanding of these underlying factors, the development of successful interventions to break the FOF cycle
in pwMS is unlikely. Therefore, the specific aims of this project are to 1.) Identify the contributions of motor and
cognitive functioning and key brain regions associated with these processes to FOF 2.) Determine the effect of
psychological functioning and key brain regions involved in emotion to FOF; and 3.) Determine the predictive
utility of baseline imaging and clinical performance measures to predict FOF, and in turn physical activity and
falls over time. My central hypothesis is that neural and behavioral factors related to motor, cognitive, and
psychological functioning will contribute to FOF and serve as predictors of long-term physical activity and falls. I
will test this hypothesis in 40 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS. In a single session, participants are
undergoing an MRI and a comprehensive battery of motor, cognitive, and psychological assessments. After the
visit, participants are monitored for 6 months to obtain longitudinal FOF, prospective falls, and physical activity
data. This proposal provides an important scientific advancement in understanding mechanisms underlying FOF
by bridging together neuroimaging, clinical assessments, and prospective data. The sponsor and advisory
committee are exceptionally qualified to provide scientific, clinical, and professional guidance. Mentor Fritz is an
established researcher in MS neurorehabilitation and fall prevention. The advisory committee consists of
accomplished researchers who will provide complementary expertise in neuroimaging, FOF psychopathology,
fear-related neurocircuitry, and statistical analyses. This training project will provide me with the critical skills and
research training to subsequently expand on this work as a postdoctoral research fellow, ultimately leading to a
career as an independent neuroscientist committed to identifying targets for FOF and fall prevention."
10994355,"ABSTRACT
Infection induced host cell stress underlies many host-pathogen engagements, yet the mechanisms by which
host cell stress influences the innate immune response to infection remain poorly understood. The Integrated
Stress Response (ISR) is an evolutionally conserved intracellular signaling pathway allowing cells to adapt to
environmental and pathological conditions. Upon activation of one or more of the four stress sensing kinases,
the signaling cascade converges into one central pathway and the ISR quickly controls cellular programming
through transcriptional and translational regulation to stimulate cellular repair, metabolic reprogramming, and
cell to cell signaling in an effort to return to homeostasis. My preliminary data demonstrate that the human
adapted pathogen, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (STY), activates the murine macrophage ISR during
infection. As the causative agent of typhoid fever, STY is a global health burden with millions of cases per year
and tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. By using a maladapted host model of infection, this
research aims to understand STY-restricting host factors typically evaded in human macrophages, allowing for
future targeted drug development against this global pathogen. Further preliminary findings demonstrate that
induction of the ISR by STY requires the ISR kinase GCN2, a sensor of nutrient stress and ribosomal dysfunction.
I find that BMDMs lacking GCN2 produce lower levels of inflammatory cytokines and permit higher STY burden
during infection than WT controls. Additional preliminary data suggest that GCN2 controls macrophage
polarization and metabolic reprogramming in response to STY. Together, these data inform my hypothesis that
S. Typhi activation of the macrophage ISR shapes the innate immune response and infection outcomes. To test
this hypothesis, I will perform two aims that reveal the role of GCN2 in shaping macrophage metabolism and the
macrophage functions impacted by ISR activation in response to STY. Using cell culture, metabolomics, and in
vivo infection techniques, this proposal will capture how cellular stress defines the potential of a critical innate
immune cell during STY infection. Discoveries made through completion of these aims will be significant as
studies of S. Typhi infection biology have limited due to STY’s human-restricted host adaptation."

Degeneration of neuronal axons is a hallmark of diverse neuropathological conditions, ranging from acute nerve
injuries to chronic neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases. If we better understood the mechanisms of
axon degeneration, we could devise new therapies to potentially slow or prevent axon degeneration and
ameliorate a range of neuropathologies. Recent findings suggest that one key event in axon degeneration is the
loss of ‘axon survival factors’, labile proteins whose continuous supply from neuronal cell bodies to distal axons
normally ensures axon integrity. The damage to axons that occurs after injury, or in chronic neuropathies,
disrupts the supply of survival factors and triggers distal axon degeneration. The best-known axon survival factor,
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyl transferase-2 (NMNAT2) requires the protein-lipid modification
palmitoylation for its fast axonal transport, but how palmitoylation contributes to NMNAT2 degradation is not fully
clear. I identified previously unrecognized phosphorylation sites on NMNAT2, whose phosphorylation by c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK) triggers selective degradation of palmitoyl-NMNAT2 in cultured cells. While addressing
this question, I also realized that several other regulators of axon degeneration are palmitoylated, in addition to
NMNAT2. Given that palmitoylation is the only reversible protein-lipid modification, I asked if acute
depalmitoylation of NMNAT2 and/or other axonal proteins is important for axon degeneration. My results
revealed that pharmacological inhibition of protein depalmitoylases indeed protects axons from degeneration
and additional preliminary genetic data ascribe this protection to block of a recently described depalmitoylase,
ABHD16A. However, axon protection by depalmitoylase inhibitors is independent of NMNAT2 and other known
axon survival factors, suggesting that additional protein(s) are depalmitoylated after axonal damage to drive
subsequent degeneration. The hypothesis that underlies this proposal is that palmitoylation plays broad,
previously unrecognized roles in the control of axon degeneration. Experiments in Aim 1 will use a recently
generated phospho-mutant knockin mouse to define the importance of phosphorylation by JNK for NMNAT2
degradation and subsequent axon degeneration, both in cultured neurons and in vivo. Aim 2A will determine
whether ABHD16A is indeed the key depalmitoylase whose activity is required for axon degeneration and will
provide the first cell biological characterization of ABHD16A localization in axons. In Aim 2B I will break new
ground by comprehensively identifying axonal proteins that are rapidly depalmitoylated after axonal injury, in
order to identify those protein(s) whose acute depalmitoylation drives axon degeneration. Together, the results
of these studies will provide new insights into the cell biology of axonal (de)palmitoylation, will define key events
that drive axon degeneration, and could reveal new therapeutic strategies to ameliorate a host of
neuropathological conditions."

During the previous funding period, we made important strides in answering the fundamental mechanistic
question of how TET2, DNMT3A and ASXL1 mutations give rise to clonal hematopoiesis (CH), cancer and
inflammation. We performed biochemical and genomic analyses that linked TET deficiency to an unexpected
loss of DNA methylation in heterochromatin. Given that DNMT3A and TET proteins have opposite biochemical
functions, our finding of decreased DNA methylation in heterochromatin of both Dnmt3a KO and Tet2 KO cells
is the only common feature that explains the unexpectedly greater disease severity of Dnmt3a KO, Tet2 KO
(DKO) mice compared to mice with individual Dnmt3a or Tet2 gene disruptions. We also showed that CH- and
cancer-associated mutations in ASXL1 result in reduced histone 3 lysine methylation (H3K9me2/me3) in hetero-
chromatin, thus linking all three of the top proteins mutated in clonal hematopoiesis – TET2, DNMT3A and ASXL1
– to the fundamental process of impaired heterochromatin integrity due to reduced DNA or H3K9 methylation in
heterochromatin. Interference with DNA or H3K9 methylation in heterochromatin has been known for decades
to result in increased expression of transposable elements, genome instability and inflammation, all common
features of cancer, inflammation and aging. Finally, we showed that OGT normally restrains TET activity in
mESC, and that consequently, OGT deficiency increases TET activity genome-wide and results in genome-wide
DNA demethylation. In this renewal application, we will ask how the TET-OGT interaction regulates DNA
methylation, focusing on the protein-protein interactions and regulatory mechanisms that operate within TET-
OGT complexes in mESC and hematopoietic-lineage cells. We will define how DNMTs and TETs cooperate to
reduce DNA methylation in heterochromatin by examining DNMT3A redistribution and DNMT1/UHRF1 stability.
We will explore the mechanism of how CH-associated mutations in ASXL1 lead to reduced H3K9 methylation in
heterochromatin, again focusing on protein-protein interactions and regulatory mechanisms that operate within
two distinct ASXL1-associated protein complexes that we have recently defined. We will identify individual
members of TE families that are uniquely upregulated in TET2, DNMT3A and ASXL1-mutant cells, so as to
determine how increased TE expression can have potentially indirect and stochastic effects on the expression
of nearby genes by acting as promoters, enhancers or both. Lastly, we will perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to
elucidate how TET deficiency and ASXL1 mutations are linked to inflammation. Our studies will illuminate the
mechanistically elusive connections between DNA and H3K9 methylation, clonal hematopoiesis, cancer,
inflammation and aging, and improve our understanding of heterochromatin, a compartment of the genome that
is very poorly understood."

 The proposed diversity supplement extends the parent grant's research on magnesium
(Mg) supplementation in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF), examining its
differential impact across diverse racial, ethnic, and gender groups. This research addresses the
knowledge gap surrounding the safety and efficacy of dietary supplements, particularly in the
absence of FDA approval and comprehensive post-marketing surveillance. Preliminary data from
the parent grant's pilot study suggest that Mg supplementation may reduce HF risk in patients
with DM and enhance outcomes in those with HF. Given the substantial impact of HF and DM on
millions of Americans, further investigation is essential. The diversity supplement comprises three
specific aims to investigate Mg supplementation's role in diverse subpopulations. Aim 1 focuses
on patients with DM from the parent grant, investigating whether oral Mg supplementation is
associated with reduced incident HF risk, varying by race, sex, and ethnicity, with sub-hypotheses
examining differences among African-American, Hispanic, and male Veterans. Aim 2
concentrates on patients with incident HF, exploring the relationship between oral Mg
supplementation and the risk of death and hospitalization among HF patients, considering diverse
populations. Aim 3 seeks to understand provider and patient perspectives on self-reported
consumption of over-the-counter Mg supplementation in the context of HF prevention and
management. Aims 1 and 2 will be achieved by interrogating the Veterans Affairs (VA) national
EHR data that includes over 2 million Veterans with DM and 1 million with HF with ~20 years of
longitudinal data on Mg supplements, serum Mg, and outcomes. As for Aim 3, in identifying and
recruiting participants for the provider group, we will employ a strategic snowball sampling
approach, guided by local champions. This method will facilitate the formation of two distinct focus
groups: one comprising patients and the other consisting of physicians. The findings generated
by this proposed supplement will offer valuable insights into the disparities in HF incidence and
outcomes among different demographic groups, particularly those defined by race, ethnicity, and
gender, while shedding light on the potential influence of mg supplementation in mitigating these
disparities. This research addresses a critical gap in cardiovascular literature and has the potential
to inform targeted interventions for at-risk populations and promote health equity in the context of
HF."

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepacivirus that chronically infects an estimated 58 million people worldwide and
can result in end-stage liver disease. It has been well established that ineffectual T cell responses contribute to
the establishment and maintenance of chronic HCV infection. Namely, T cell exhaustion, wherein T cells lose
effector and proliferative functions due to chronic antigen stimulation, is a common phenomenon observed in
chronic HCV patients and is known to enable viral persistence. However, it has proven difficult to define
mechanistically different aspects of immune dysfunction in chronic hepacivirus infection, in part due to a lack of
animal models that can support chronic HCV infection and elicit a similar immune response. Norway rat
hepacivirus (NrHV) is a close relative of HCV that can establish chronic infection in immunocompetent mice and
recapitulate key features of chronic HCV, thus serving as a physiologically relevant and experimentally tractable
model for studying the immune response to chronic hepacivirus infection. Despite its promise as a model for
studying various aspects of the immune response to chronic hepacivirus infection, an in-depth characterization
of the immune landscape over time in chronic NrHV infection in mice has yet to be performed.
Here, I propose performing high-resolution immunological characterizations of this novel murine model of chronic
hepacivirus infection to study the evolution of immune dysfunction over the course of infection and to better
understand the molecular drivers of T cell exhaustion and viral persistence in chronic hepacivirus infection. First,
I will model transcriptional regulatory networks in chronic hepacivirus infection and other contexts of T cell
exhaustion to identify common and distinct transcriptional programs defining immune dysfunction (Aim 1). My
preliminary findings from existing transcriptomic data on this model suggest that there are two distinct lineages
of exhausted T cells in NrHV infection which may recognize viral antigen. Therefore, I will define the phenotypic
features of the two exhausted lineages in this model to elucidate the relationship between TCR specificity and
cellular phenotypes of virus-specific exhausted T cells (Aim 2). These studies are expected to ultimately
contribute to our understanding of the immunological mechanisms that drive T cell exhaustion, hinder hepacivirus
clearance, and contribute to the pathogenesis of viral liver disease in chronic HCV infection. The proposed
project provides an excellent training opportunity and environment that encompasses mastering cutting-edge
single cell and immunological techniques, professional development, and mentorship that support my goals and
growth as an independent research scientist."

In the United States, 3 million people have received dental implants, and it is predicted that 500,000 dental
implants will be newly placed every year. While dental implants have been a popular option to replace lost teeth,
peri-implantitis (PI) is getting more prevalent, affecting 24% of dental implant patients. PI is an oral inflammatory
disease causing soft and hard tissue breakdowns around dental implants. PI is challenging to treat because of
its irreversible aspect, aggressive progression, and difficulty in cleaning implant surface. The current treatment
modalities for PI are mainly limited to surgical interventions, which are generally more invasive, painful, and time-
intensive. Moreover, these treatments fail to address the host’s uncontrolled immune response and subsequent
microbial dysbiosis. In light of previous studies showing that altered host-microbiome interactions may play key
roles in PI pathogenesis, I propose to study immunomodulatory strategies as potential treatment options. The
objective of this study is to determine the protective role of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) on host-
microbiome interactions through direct polarization of macrophages into M2-like anti-inflammatory phenotypes.
The murine ligature-induced PI is used as a model for an inflammatory disease where tissue destruction is driven
by a breakdown of host-microbe homeostasis. In this study, I hypothesize that the local delivery of CCL2-
releasing microparticles (CCL2 MPs) into peri-implant tissues will restore the balance of M1/M2 by polarizing
macrophages to M2-like phenotype, create an anti-inflammatory environment, and reverse disease-associated
microbial changes in PI. This proposal aims to 1) unravel the immunomodulatory effects of CCL2 on immune
cells and their downstream pathways and 2) determine the effects of CCL2 on disease-associated bacteria and
microbial dysbiosis. In aim 1, the murine ligature-induced PI model will be used with or without local delivery of
CCL2 MPs. Then, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) will be performed to acquire in-depth data about the
PI pathogenesis and mechanistic CCL2’s function on immune cells by evaluating pathways and differentially
expressed genes. In addition, scRNA-seq data will be complemented by Flow Cytometry data. In aim 2, 16S
rRNA gene sequencing analysis on peri-implant plaque buildup will be conducted to assess CCL2’s therapeutic
effects on PI-related bacterial species and microbial dysbiosis by modulating the host’s inflammatory response.
I will evaluate the total bacterial load and shifts in microbiome compositions with or without CCL2 MPs. The
overall goal of this proposal is to challenge the unmet need for effective therapies to treat PI by applying a novel
immunomodulatory therapy. Successful completion of this proposed study will expand our understanding of PI
pathogenesis and support the therapeutic potential of local immunomodulation in PI."

Despite increases in suicides among children, we have no available developmentally and culturally informed
measures of childhood suicide ideation (SI) to inform risk assessment. In addition, there is little information
about how to integrate caregiver reports into assessment of child SI subtypes (based on frequency) and
pathways of suicide risk (based on thematic analysis) among adolescents. A recent study on the severity of SI,
revealed that the most common form of SI among children who had attempted suicide was nonspecific active
SI (without plan, method, or intent). In the absence of a plan, a method, or intent as markers of risk,
assessments may need an approach that focuses on expressions of distress preceding the SI or attempt,
which may be more easily reported by children and detected by caregivers. Body mapping is a “ground-zero”
assessment of expressions of distress that is low in cultural bias and can complement data from verbal reports.
The overall goal of this R01 is to characterize childhood SI and expressions of distress – as assessed by child
and caregiver report – to improve prediction of SI severity and suicide attempts among ethnoracially diverse
children. In consultation with a Community Advisory Board of youth, caregivers, and health workers, we will
conduct a mixed methods study of a diverse sample of 150 children, ages 8-12, with recent SI or SA, and their
caregivers, recruited from emergency departments in New York City and Austin, Texas. Dyads will be
interviewed within two weeks of the child’s SI or attempt, and three and six months later. This project aims: 1)
To identify profiles of SI among ethnoracially diverse children using mixed methods; 2) to test how child SI
profiles predict SI severity trajectories over time; and 3) To test whether child SI profiles show differences in
expressions of distress, as reported by children and caregivers. This project aligns with the NIMH mission of
designing culturally and developmentally informed suicide risk assessments for children. Our findings will
reveal profiles of SI and expressions of distress that children display when they are thinking about suicide or
just before they attempt suicide. The combination of verbal and nonverbal methods, quantitative and qualitative
approaches, and caregiver and child reports overcome limitations of traditional assessments that are mostly
based on verbal responses to a few questions about the presence or absence of suicide ideation or attempts."
10989355,"Filoviruses emerge nearly annually and cause hemorrhagic fever with high mortality, and frequent unpredictable outbreaks. Development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents is needed and will be guided by a clear understanding of the structures and assemblies of essential viral machinery. The filovirus nucleocapsid forms the core of the virion and is essential for replication and transcription of the viral genome and host immune suppression. The viral replication and nucleocapsid assembly occur in viral replication factories in host cytoplasm. Assembly of these nucleocapsids in replication factories and their subsequent transport to the cell surface, and packaging into virions are all critical steps in the filovirus life cycle. Much about these essential processes, however, remains unknown, because the assembly processes happen inside cells, and traditional structural biology approaches involved use of purified, often recombinant, samples outside cells. Thus, we do not yet have structural understandings of what filovirus assembly, transport, matrix-interaction and virion-recruitment processes look like. For example, structures are available for the recombinant N-terminal half of the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) coiled with cellular RNA, but we don’t yet understand the structure of the C-terminal half of NP that recruits the other NC proteins, nor do we understand how other viral proteins assemble to form complete nucleocapsid structure or how the nucleocapsid interacts with the virus matrix. A new technology, in situ cryo-electron tomography, now allows us to carry out structural biology analyses inside cells and allows us to collect previously inaccessible information about the structure of the assembling nucleocapsid inside infected cells. The goal of this project is to apply cryo-focused ion beam (FIB) milling-enabled in situ cryo-electron tomography (cryo-FIB-ET) to understand how the Ebola virus nucleocapsid is assembled inside cells and how the structures change before and after virion incorporation. Study of these complexes inside cells, from both transfected and infected cells, will provide us our first information about the assembly process of virus replication factories inside cells and complete structural model of filovirus nucleocapsid structure. The fundamental structural organization and critical protein interfaces revealed in this study are likely conserved among all filoviruses. Hence, the proposed work will provide insight into the fundamental structural principles of filovirus assembly. The knowledge and expertise gained here may also be relevant for understanding the structures of other negative-strand RNA viruses that have a similar protein structural organization."

 The science is overwhelming that our planet is changing, and these climatic changes are exerting
catastrophic pressures on local communities, with little time to reverse course. In the US, climatic variability
and associated changes in weather patterns are creating new health risks and exacerbating existing health
disparities in overburdened communities across the Nation. Local health departments and health care systems
are front line defenders of the population’s health and play a key role in a community’s resilience to climate
change. Yet climate-related health threats are not currently prioritized in local or regional community health
assessment efforts, particularly in rural areas like Southern Appalachia. Partnerships between hospital, public
health, community members, and environmental health scientists are often underutilized channels in examining
the health impact of climate change as an environmental determinant that works independently and jointly with
other social determinants to amplify local health risks. The overarching goal of this community-driven
project is to integrate climate change impacts into a regional health assessment framework to enhance
the capacity of local public health systems to protect the health of rural communities. We will achieve
the following specific aims: Aim 1. Integrate climate change data into the regional community health
assessment and examine climate sensitivities in priority health concerns; Aim 2. Engage regional hospitals,
public health departments, and community members in the co-design of visual storytelling of local climate and
health priorities; and Aim 3. Co-design targeted communication messaging to advance awareness on regional
climate impacts on health. Our expected outcomes will include the: (1) integration of climate data into a
regional community health assessment planning process; (2) identification intrinsic rural community health
networks that will inspire commitment and foster capacity for community-wide participation in present and
future climate resilience planning; and (3) targeted communication trainings and public health messaging to
advance awareness on current and future climate impacts in the region. This work has the potential to be
transformative to the field by providing a public health model for integrating climate change impacts in a
regional community health assessment process for rural and historically marginalized communities. The long-
term goal is to advance a national model that demonstrates the identification, prioritization, and implementation
strategies to help communities address climate change impacts on health. This project will leverage WNC
Health Impact, a partnership and coordinated process in existence for over a decade, to engage hospitals,
public health agencies, and key regional partners in a 16-county region in rural Appalachia around a vision of
improved community health. Results will address a well-cited research need from the NIH Climate Change and
Health Strategic plan to identify and develop local and regional interventions to monitor and reduce the
adverse health effects of climate change in rural populations."

Nicotine is the primary addictive agent driving chronic smoking/vaping. Women experience greater nicotine use
vulnerability, insofar that they become addicted to nicotine faster than men and exhibit higher smoking relapse
rates. Women are also at greater risk of smoking-related heart attacks, cancers, and mortality. Hormonal
contraceptives typically contain a synthetic estrogen (e.g., ethinyl estradiol or EE) and/or a progestin (e.g.,
levonorgestrel or LEVO), and are taken by 50% of premenopausal smokers. Contraceptive hormones are
associated with higher smoking rates, enhanced nicotine reward, and a greater risk of smoking-related illness
and mortality. Hormonal contraceptives are thus clearly linked with the public health burden of smoking. A
better understanding of factors driving enhanced nicotine use vulnerability amongst women, and how hormonal
contraceptives work to augment that vulnerability, would be of enormous benefit. The reinforcing effects of
nicotine are weak compared to the tenacious addiction that nicotine maintains, leading the field to seek other
factors involved in the development of nicotine use disorder. Indeed, environmental stimuli that commonly co-
occur with nicotine (e.g., smell, taste, or sight of cigarettes/vapes) have been found to play a large role in
smoking/vaping maintenance, particularly for women smokers. The enhanced import of environmental factors
in nicotine intake extends to female rats, suggesting this sex-linked disparity may be rooted in biology more
generally, or perhaps sex hormones more specifically. One such environmental factor is the enhancement by
nicotine of the reinforcing value of other rewarding stimuli. In rats, the species studied here, our lab and others
have found that responding for nicotine infusions alone was not reliably above saline suggesting a lack of primary
reinforcement by nicotine. However, when nicotine infusions co-occurred with weakly reinforcing visual stimuli
(e.g., a brief light presentation), nicotine-maintained responding increased up to eight-fold. This synergistic
effect of nicotine reward-enhancement on nicotine intake was more prominent in female rats. Using a preclinical
model of the role of reward-enhancement in nicotine intake, the proposed studies will test whether contraceptive
hormones alter nicotine intake via the direct primary reinforcing effects of nicotine, or rather via augmenting the
role of reward-enhancement in nicotine self-administration. The Specific Aims will examine the separate effects
of EE (Aim 1) and LEVO (Aim 2) on the role of reinforcement and reward-enhancement in an intravenous
nicotine self-administration task. To this end, separate groups of ovary-intact female rats will respond for
nicotine or saline infusions and will receive daily EE (Aim 1) or LEVO (Aim 2) injections before self-
administration sessions. Each rat will undergo separate conditions with access to infusions alone or infusions
delivered with a moderately reinforcing visual stimulus. We hypothesize that EE will increase and LEVO will
decrease nicotine self-administration and do so via modulating the role of reward-enhancement in nicotine self-
administration."

ABSTRACT
 Women’s reproductive health plays a pivotal role in regulating overall well-being. Unfortunately, about 12%
of reproductive-age women experience infertility. One of the most common causes of infertility is anovulation or
oligo-ovulation, supporting the paramount role of the ovulatory process in female reproductive success. Although
a few key ovulatory mediators induced by LH have been established, new and innovative research techniques
continue to discover new players in the ovulatory process. Using RNA sequencing, we have identified several
long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, transcripts >200 nucleotides) that are regulated during the periovulatory period
in mouse granulosa cells. In past, these lncRNAs were considered as junk DNA and believed to be transcriptional
noise and functionless. But, in recent years, evidence has accumulated showing that lncRNAs are widely
expressed, are tissue-specific, and have key roles in gene regulation by interacting with DNA, RNA, and proteins.
However, the role of lncRNAs in the ovary and specifically the ovulatory process has not been well explored.
From our novel RNA sequencing data, we have found 10 lncRNAs transcripts that are increased in granulosa
cells collected at 4h and 12h after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG: LH analog) administration. Amongst
these 10 lncRNAs, Gm12648, a 656-nucleotide lncRNA was the most highly induced by hCG (160-fold).
Although very little is known about Gm12648, it is located directly upstream of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor
2A which encodes the cell-cycle inhibitor p16 in the mouse. Moreover, the RNA-RNA interactome shows that
Gm12648 can interact with transcription factors (TFs) that are essential during the ovulatory process. Thus, it is
possible that Gm12648 may exert some regulatory control of genes and TFs and thereby possibly contribute to
ovarian cell fate during the periovulatory period. Similarly, other hCG upregulated lncRNAs could also exert their
regulatory role on adjacent protein-coding genes. Thus, our goal is to identify the top 5 most highly LH/hCG-
regulated candidate lncRNAs and investigate the function of these lncRNAs in the ovary, specifically their role
in the ovulatory process. To achieve our goal, mouse ovaries, granulosa cells, and COCs collected across the
periovulatory period will be utilized to characterize the expression of lncRNAs that were discovered in our
preliminary study (Aim 1), determine the target genes of Gm12648 in the granulosa cells using a RNA-seq and
RNA-RNA interaction assay approach after knocking down the expression of Gm12648 (Aim 2), and begin to
elucidate the function of Gm12648 by characterizing the proteins coded by the target genes, and identify post-
translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (Aim 3) in the
ovulation process. We will use a high-impact, translational mouse model in this study. The proposed project will
lay a foundation for future studies examining lncRNA function in the human ovary. These discoveries will further
improve our understanding of the ovulatory process which provides a fundamental platform to improve infertility
treatments and/or to develop the contraceptive measures that specifically target ovulation inhibition."

Respiratory viruses, such as Influenza A virus, rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and
coronavirus, trigger innate inflammation and lung tissue damage in patients of all ages, particularly premature
infants and elderly adults. During respiratory viral infection, interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a pivotal role in promptly
and transiently activating and regulating the proper mucosal antiviral immunity to fight and clear the pathogen.
However, excessive and persistent IL-6 production may promote virus survival and exacerbation of clinical
symptoms. Therefore, the regulatory mechanisms that shape and fine-tune the precise IL-6 response to
respiratory viruses needs to be well understood. In order to gain insight into the genome-wide control of gene
transcription in mucosal epithelial antiviral response, we applied precision nuclear run-on next generation
sequencing (PRO-Seq) to human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs) infected with RV. In the IL-6 gene
locus, we have identified an upstream cis-regulatory element (URE) that resides within an open chromatin
domain and encodes noncoding RNAs bidirectionally. Our preliminary data showed that this unannotated URE
is a dual-function regulatory element of IL-6 expression, acting as a silencer in normal airway epithelial cells
but as an enhancer in epithelial cells that undergo cellular plasticity to develop mesenchymal characteristics as
seen in chronic airway remodeling. In this R21 application, we will investigate the hypothesis that the IL-6 URE
is an epigenetic silencer of IL-6 expression in mucosal epithelial cells, and that the silencer-enhancer transition
dysregulates IL-6 expression in response to cellular plasticity. Our project seeks to understand how the
functional switch of the IL-6 URE from silencer to enhancer activity associates with IL-6 expression, either
through chromatin interactions with IL-6 promoter (chromatin looping) or via functions of its bidirectional non-
coding RNAs. We have assembled a highly skilled interdisciplinary team to dissect the contributions of our
identified IL-6 URE in two specific aims: Aim 1, the chromatin interaction between IL-6 URE and promoter
determines its function as a silencer or enhancer in different cellular contexts. Aim 2, the bidirectional non-
coding RNAs transcribed at IL-6 URE serves as docking sites to recruit epigenetic regulators that affects the
transcriptional elongation of IL-6. We are the first to identify IL-6 URE and its derived noncoding RNAs that will
advance us to understand how dynamic interactions between cis-regulatory elements facilitate precise gene
regulatory response to epithelial cell plasticity. Our final goal is to offer novel translational targets that
selectively alter IL-6 expression in certain cell settings while not in others, therefore significantly reducing side
effects for therapeutics of IL-6 associated clinical disorders."
10988787,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given our obesogenic environment with abundant access to energy-dense foods, parents often feel lost about
how to help their kids make healthy food choices. This can lead to overly restrictive food parenting practices
that can have negative consequences on child eating and weight outcomes. There is some evidence that
positive food parenting practices (i.e., structure-based and autonomy supporting feeding practices that are
responsive to child needs) are associated with healthy child eating and weight outcomes. In the ongoing K01,
food parenting is being experimentally-manipulated in two conditions, coercive control and structure-based
feeding, with objectively measured child eating behavior assessed in the laboratory after each condition.
Preliminary data suggest that children with overweight consumed fewer calories after the structure-based
feeding condition than they did after the coercive control feeding condition. This suggests that the use of
positive food parenting may support healthier eating behaviors, but more work is needed to examine long-term
impacts on eating and weight outcomes. Taken together, parents need effective tools to help encourage
healthy eating and growth while reducing the risk of obesity. The goal for this program of research is to develop
an evidence-based positive food parenting (i.e., high in structure, autonomy promoting) intervention to give
parents the tools to promote healthy child growth and improve diet quality in children to prevent obesity. To
achieve this goal, there is a need to: identify a novel treatment target (i.e., positive food parenting practices,
focus of the K01); develop and pilot the acceptability and feasibility of this intervention (focus of this R03
proposal); and test the efficacy of this intervention (future R01 proposal). To achieve this, the R03 has two
specific aims. The goal of Specific Aim 1 is to develop a positive food parenting intervention with a focus on
structure-based and autonomy promoting practices. The intervention will be developed based on review of the
research on positive food parenting and feedback from a survey of parents of children ages 5-11. Curriculum
will also be developed to cover the most common feeding challenges mentioned by parents in the survey (e.g.,
child refusing to eat what is served, parent not having time to cook). In Specific Aim 2, the intervention will be
piloted and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated. This will be done by enrolling
32 parent-child dyads in the 12 session (8 group, 4 individual) intervention using a waitlist control design. Once
the intervention is designed and has been shown to be both acceptable to parents and feasible to conduct, the
efficacy of this intervention will be evaluated in a fully powered R01. This R03 is a critical first step toward
developing an efficacy trial and fully powered randomized controlled trial testing the impact of positive food
parenting practices on child weight and eating behavior in children at risk for obesity."
10991057,"HIV incidence remains high for women in Southern Africa and HIV acquisition risk doubles during pregnancy
and postpartum compared to non-pregnant periods. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is promising, with oral
PrEP pills and the dapivirine vaginal ring (DPV-VR) recommended by WHO and national HIV programs. Yet,
research to improve PrEP use in pregnant and postpartum women lags behind other populations, creating
inequitable PrEP access during periods of high HIV risk. PrEP delivery integrated into antenatal care yields high
oral PrEP uptake among women with known HIV risk, though discontinuation and sub-optimal adherence are
common. Low perceived HIV risk, pill burden, side effects that overlap with pregnancy symptoms (e.g., nausea),
and infant safety concerns are key reasons for declining and discontinuing oral PrEP during pregnancy. Refining
risk perception with diagnostic testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may increase PrEP uptake, yet
syndromic STI management persists as standard of care in the region. Pill burden could be addressed by offering
DPV-VR which also has less systemic side effects, like nausea. Bolstering the safety profile of DPV-VR use in
pregnancy could inform messaging for PrEP choices and scale-up in antenatal care. Strategies to optimize PrEP
use in pregnancy with rigorous safety evaluation are needed to advance delivery of expanded PrEP options. Our
team found high STI prevalence among pregnant women in Botswana, making antenatal STI testing a potentially
high-yield strategy in this setting. Botswana is ideal for expanding PrEP options beyond oral pills in antenatal
care and co-delivering STI testing given its high antenatal care coverage, commitment to improve the HIV/STI
care cascades, and proof-of-concept data for antenatal STI testing. In collaboration with the Botswana Ministry
of Health, we propose a randomized trial to determine the effect of co-offering STI testing with enhanced PrEP
options on PrEP use in pregnancy through postpartum. We will also prospectively gather safety data and
implementation outcomes to expedite translation into practice. Our overarching hypothesis is that STI testing
with expanded PrEP options will improve PrEP use in pregnancy and lactation, will be safe, and will be
acceptable in antenatal care. Aim 1 will conduct a randomized trial among women without HIV seeking antenatal
care at public clinics in Botswana to determine whether the addition of STI testing to antenatal PrEP delivery
with expanded PrEP options improves the proportion of pregnant women who initiate PrEP when offered, persist
with use at 9 months postpartum after self-selecting daily oral PrEP or the DPV-VR, and adhere (quantified by
drug levels). Aim 2 of this study will utilize hair samples collected from mother-infant pairs enrolled in Aim 1 to
quantify DPV exposure and to prospectively evaluate pregnancy and infant safety outcomes following DPV
exposure. Aim 3 will assess implementation outcomes to inform scale up of integrating STI testing and the DPV-
VR into antenatal care. Our study is designed to inform STI testing and DPV-VR delivery for pregnant women
and provide necessary evidence to inform policy decisions in Botswana and other HIV high-burden settings."

We propose to establish the National Center for In-situ Tomographic Ultramicroscopy (NCITU) to be based at
the Simons Electron Microscopy Center (SEMC), which is a part of the New York Structural Biology Center
(NYSBC), based in New York, NY. NCITU will be dedicated to developing and providing access to both standard
and advanced methods for in-situ cryoET specimen preparation, and to disseminating this expertise through a
cryoET cross-training program designed to serve a wide variety of skill levels and career goals.
The primary goal of NCITU will be to provide user access and service towards preparing specimen for direct
visualization of macromolecular associations and organization, particularly in native cells. A highly qualified
technical team will provide direct hands-on service, guidance, and assistance to ensure that samples and grids
are prepared with the highest quality and in the shortest time possible. An already well established cross-training
program will be expanded and extended to provide training in every aspect of the cryoET specimen preparation
pipeline. The operations at NCITU will build on already established practices at SEMC/NYSBC and benefit from
the overall vibrant environment as well as the expertise of the highly trained staff already in place.
NCITU will provide a full range of services for in-situ sample preparation for tomography including: culturing
biological samples, plunge freezing and high pressure freezing, cryo-light microscopy (cryoLM), cryo-
ultramicrotomy, focused ion beam milling (FIB-milling) including lift-out, and initial cryoTEM screening prior to
submission of specimens to the network Hub for high-resolution cryoET data collection. We have already
established workflows for many of these activities and have active research projects focused on expanding
capabilities for automating and streamlining the entire workflow. We will continue to stay at the forefront of new
developments in this area and we will incorporate new methods, technologies and workflows into the standard
NCITU operating procedures as soon as these are stable and robust.
While the goals of NCITU are not innately innovative, it is our intention to set the standard as one of the first
world class, nationally accessible cryoET sample preparation facilities, to provide access and training that is
freely and fairly available to all researchers in the US, and to continually strive to improve methods and enable
science of the highest quality and value."
10991189,"Abstract
 Homicide, often at the hands of intimate partners, is a leading cause of pregnancy-related death.
Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread and serious public health problem. Globally, 30% of ever-
partnered women experience physical or sexual IPV, and over one third of female homicides are perpetrated
by intimate partners. Significant evidence demonstrates that IPV is a preventable cause of maternal mortality,
and poor health before, during, and after pregnancy, including severe maternal morbidity, especially for
populations that are disproportionately affected by maternal mortality and severe morbidity. The evidence base
on IPV has yet to translate evidence into effective interventions to improve maternal health and safety and
promote health equity. A core competency for maternal health researchers is understanding how to best
measure IPV and conduct IPV-related research in accordance with ethical protections specific to this topic.
These skills are critical building blocks to integrate IPV concepts within clinical, epidemiological, and
intervention research and practice in maternal health. Yet to date, dedicated IPV-related coursework in health-
related graduate and professional programs is quite limited. IPV is often included only peripherally within
coursework, and does not cover the nuances of measurement across populations, necessary ethical
protections, and importantly, the culturally-specific assessments and interventions necessary for successful
implementation and impact to achieve health equity. IPV-related training is thus an actionable gap in our
national ability to understand and address IPV as a threat to maternal health and health equity. Our
experienced, multidisciplinary team thus proposes a 2-year training project to: 1) develop an applied
educational curriculum to advance IPV measurement and research skills for diverse populations, 2) pilot and
implement the curriculum through an online accelerated short course within the Johns Hopkins University
Institute series, and 3) accelerate IPV research skills application by fostering community among trainees, and
providing ongoing mentoring and technical support as they build and apply their new skills. Our project fills a
critical gap in available training and accelerates progress on national goals of improved maternal health and
pregnancy outcomes through equipping the clinical and research workforce with specific skills and knowledge
necessary to integrate IPV-related experiences within maternal health research. The training will accelerate
the quality and impact of IPV-related clinical and intervention-related maternal health research for populations
in greatest need. In doing so, we advance national capacity to mitigate preventable maternal mortality,
decrease severe maternal morbidity, and promote health equity."
10997269,"Project Summary/Abstract of Parent R01 “Synergistic killing of bacterial pathogens by histones”
(1R01AI163196)
 The effective treatment of bacterial infections of skin, deep soft tissues and wounds continues to be a
major unmet challenge in healthcare settings, especially among patients with chronic diabetes. Staphylococcus
aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most common bacteria that are isolated from chronic, non-
healing wounds. Antibiotic resistance has arisen in these particular bacteria, causing these infections to
become increasingly difficult to treat and giving rise to multi-drug resistant strains, including Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
 The goal of the proposed work is to develop the next generation of antimicrobials for which the design
is inspired by a better mechanistic understanding of mammalian antimicrobial defense pathways. We focus our
attention on the antimicrobial activities of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which use histones to kill or
suppress microbial proliferation. The antimicrobial mechanism of histones has not been understood. The
Siryaporn and Gross labs recently reported that the pairing of histones with an additional component found in
NETs – the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 (cathelicidin) – produces potent antimicrobial synergy. LL-37
forms pores in the bacterial membrane, which enable histones to enter the bacterium and interfere with gene
expression. This has an irreversible bactericidal (killing) effect on bacteria. The work proposed here will exploit
this discovery by identifying combinations of human histones and membrane-/cell wall-targeting antimicrobials
(MTAs) that produce potent antimicrobial activity and synergy. The overall objective of the project is to better
understand the mechanism of antimicrobial synergy between histones and MTAs, and to harness it to establish
a class of new therapeutics for the treatment of skin infections and wounds.
 We will accomplish this objective by identifying combinations of human histones with LL-37 and other
MTAs that produce the greatest antimicrobial activities and synergies. We will test these against S. aureus, P.
aeruginosa, and communities of skin bacteria in vitro (Aim 1). We will attempt to augment the antimicrobial
activity by engineering in factors that impact histone function in NETs, specifically chemical modification
through citrullination and tethering histones to DNA fibers (Aim 2). To validate our approach, we will test the
combinations of histones and MTAs identified in Aims 1 and 2 in a standardized mouse skin infection model
(Aim 3). To additionally address the unmet challenge of treating skin infection and wounds in diabetes patients,
we will perform the tests in a diabetic mouse model.
 The results of this work will provide a mechanistic understanding of antimicrobial synergy and develop
a strategy to combat the rise of antibiotic resistance. The results of the study could create a new class of
antimicrobial therapeutics for the treatment of skin infections and wounds in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
This would represent a game-changer in the approach to antimicrobial treatments."
10995920,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This research aligns with the National Institute of Nursing Research’s (NINR) strategic plan to conduct research
through the lens of health equity and social determinants of health (SDOH) to inform practice for community
health. Even though it is well-established that type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease, there is substantial variability in risk and life expectancy across differing cardiovascular
health (CVH) factors and behaviors, in those identifying as a racial or ethnic minority (referred to herein as
“people of color”), and among individuals living in socially vulnerable areas. Ideal CVH includes 4 health
behaviors (diet, physical activity, nicotine exposure, and sleep duration) and 4 health factors (body mass index,
glucose, low density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and blood pressure [BP]) at optimal levels. Ideal CVH is
associated with greater cardiovascular disease-free survival, longevity, and higher quality of life. Disparities in
CVH and CVH outcomes among individuals living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have evolved from social inequality.
The goal of this F31 project and training plan is to develop expertise in the social and environmental determinants
of cardiovascular health equity and disparities. The purpose of this F31 training plan and proposed descriptive
study is to examine the associations among social and environmental determinants of CVH equity as well as
describe the lived experience of discrimination stress among young adults aged 18-31 years with T1D at
University Hospitals, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. In aim 1, we will examine the
association between social vulnerability and perceived discrimination stress (a path); 1a. perceived
discrimination stress and cardiovascular health (b path); 1b. social vulnerability and cardiovascular health (c
path); 1c. the role of perceived discrimination stress as a mediator; and 1d multiple oppressed identities in these
associations among 125 young adults ages 18-31 years with type 1 diabetes living in Ohio. In aim 2, we will
describe the lived experiences of perceived discrimination among 15-22 young adults with type 1 diabetes
residing in Ohio. We will prospectively enroll adults with T1D from University Hospitals a large regional healthcare
system in Ohio. Our central hypothesis is that higher individual- and area-level social vulnerability and
discrimination stress are associated with lower cardiovascular health among young adults with T1D. These novel
mechanisms may serve as key targets to reduce preventable health disparities and improve overall health in this
high-risk group where such clinical gains might otherwise be difficult to achieve."
10995530,"Project Summary: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a devastating psychiatric condition that exhibits robust
comorbidity with other mental health disorders. In 2021, approximately 1.4 million people faced cocaine use
disorder in the United States. There are no FDA approved treatments for cocaine use disorder, which presents
a major unmet medical need. Stress exposure can precipitate or worsen many mental health conditions and is
a barrier to recovery for individuals with SUD. Thus, addressing the negative consequences of stress exposure
is a critical target for therapeutic intervention in SUD. Stress acts in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a
corticolimbic node involved in motivation and reward, to influence neuronal activity and changes in dendritic
architecture. Microglia are innate immune cells in the brain whose actions contribute to stress-induced dendritic
remodeling in rodents following chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Alterations in dendritic spine morphology
are implicated in the behavioral sequelae of chronic stress exposure. Interestingly, chronic cocaine use results
in similar dendritic remodeling and prefrontal cortex deficits. The role of microglia in this process is largely
unknown. In this proposal, I will use a rat model of CUS concurrent with cocaine self-administration (SA) to
recapitulate a clinical presentation of cocaine addiction complicated by ongoing stress exposure. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that when cocaine SA is paired concurrently with CUS, rodents display increased drug seeking
in an extinction-reinstatement model. I hypothesize that cocaine SA in the context of CUS produces robust
activation of microglial machinery involved neuronal remodeling, leading to prefrontal cortex dysfunction and
facilitation of drug seeking behavior. In Aim 1, I will use flow cytometry, qRT-PCR, and advanced spine
morphometry to study microglial activity profiles and dendritic spine architecture after CUS, chronic cocaine SA,
and concurrent CUS/chronic cocaine SA. Existing literature and preliminary data demonstrate that CUS alone
causes marked changes in microglial profiles, dendritic spine morphology, and mPFC function. However, little is
known about how chronic cocaine SA or chronic cocaine SA complicated by CUS affects microglia and spine
morphology. In Aim 2, I will use a novel drug vs. non-drug choice paradigm to elucidate changes in motivation
after CUS exposure, while additionally employing a pharmacological approach to inhibit microglial contributions
to stress. During this fellowship period, I will relish the opportunity to gain technical expertise and develop
investigative acuity, to facilitate my future success as an academic physician-neuroscientist. My sponsors and I
have assembled a diverse mentorship team with a wide range of expertise. As a vital part of my professional
development, I will interact with this group of highly talented scientists, as they push my scientific capabilities
and foster my excitement for discovery. MCW offers the infrastructure and, more importantly, the people that will
offer growth opportunities and outlets for creative collaboration, as evidenced by my desire to explore the
intersectional field of neuroimmunology."
10995615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Currently, more than 6 million Americans are suffering from clinical Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's
related dementias (AD/ADRD). By 2050, this number is projected to rise to 13 million. Due to this expected
increase, there is a great need for sensitive, easily implemented, objective, and scalable methods to identify
cognitive change and differentiate individuals along the AD continuum. Neuropsychological assessments are
useful for characterizing dementia symptoms, clinical diagnosis, and monitoring, but they involve burdensome
procedures and lack ecological validity. Neuroimaging and blood markers of proteins associated with risk of
clinical AD/ADRD are often inaccessible, expensive and/or invasive, and their link to patient behavior is
inconsistent. To address these drawbacks, digital phenotyping is a novel approach that allows for passive and
continuous monitoring of behaviors and physiological metrics in everyday life using technology such as a
smartphone or smartwatch. In this study, the construct validity of smartwatch-derived metrics will be
investigated against conventional neuropsychological measures and questionnaires across preclinical
AD/ADRD stages. A diverse sample of 90 participants aged 55 and older with either healthy cognition or mild
cognitive impairment will be recruited from the Philadelphia region. Participants will be given a Garmin
Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and will wear it 23 hours/day to passively monitor sleep, heart rate variability, and
physical activity data, which then will be deidentified and transferred to a secure server daily for 30 days. A
daily survey will be completed through study software that is downloaded on participants' smartphones to
contextualize passive data collection metrics. At the first study visit, participants will complete conventional
neuropsychological tests and self-report measures of everyday function. The primary aim will examine the
validity of a smartwatch-derived digital phenotyping protocol against conventional clinical measures.
Exploratory aims will investigate 1) associations between smartwatch metrics and demographic and contextual
factors and 2) meaningful groupings of participants with unique patterns of smartwatch metrics (i.e.,
phenotypes) and their relations to clinical status and conventional cognitive measures. The proposed training
plan was developed with input from a team of interdisciplinary experts in everyday cognition in aging, digital
ethics, longitudinal statistical methods, and engineers studying physiology with the goal of developing a high
level of competence in statistical methods for wearable devices, understanding physiological measurement,
knowledge on ethics and privacy in the wearable space, and the application of digital phenotyping in a diverse
aging population."
10978426,"Project Summary
Our project focuses on the high prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) among the
Hispanic population in the United States. In 2014 ADRD affected nearly half a million Hispanic adults aged 65+
(12% of Hispanics in this age group), and this number is expected to double by 2030.
Because ADRD has limited effective interventions, we are mainly concerned with two significant risk factors:
low language acculturation and hearing loss. Low language acculturation affects over 60 million Hispanics,
hindering their participation in cognitively stimulating activities and potentially accelerating cognitive decline.
Hearing loss has recently been identified as a modifiable risk factor for ADRD. Hearing loss is associated with
cognitive function and structural brain outcomes that may be early indicators of ADRD. Notably, hearing aids
have proven to slow cognitive decline among older at higher risk for ADRD. Despite this, few Hispanic adults
with hearing loss use hearing aids. Our research aims to investigate the potential effect modification of low
language acculturation on the association between hearing loss, and cognitive function in Hispanic adults.
Using data from two studies of Hispanic adults—the Hispanic Community and Health Study/Study of Latinos
(HCHS/SOL), and the Northern Manhattan Study of Metabolism and Mind— we have three specific aims:
Aim 1. Examine whether the association between hearing loss and cognitive decline over approximately six
years among Hispanic adults in the U.S. differs by levels of language acculturation.
Aim 2. Investigate the association between hearing loss and brain health markers on MRI scans and whether
language acculturation moderates these associations.
Aim 3. Explore the link between hearing loss and Alzheimer's disease pathology markers in a different sample
from the NOMEM study and assess the role of language acculturation.
Our research will inform public health efforts and raise awareness about interventions that can mitigate the
effects of hearing loss and cognitive decline in the Hispanic community. It will have a significant impact on
healthcare providers, community organizations, and families, helping them address communication barriers
and improve access to necessary support systems."
10978451,"Heart failure (HF) is a common cause of progressive disability and death. Increased plasma renin activity (PRA)
levels are among the earliest biomarkers and modulators of HF with reduced ejection fraction (rEF). Renin is a
protease that activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to regulate salt-water homeostasis,
myocardial contractility, blood pressure, and vascular wall integrity. Chronic overactivation of the RAAS harms
the heart and circulatory system, promotes salt-water retention (edema) and cardiac remodeling, and contributes
to early mortality in HFrEF. Renin itself is activated by the cleavage of pro-renin, but despite its crucial role as a
master regulator of RAAS, the mechanism(s) responsible for pro-renin activation in the circulation remain
unknown. Insights into the mechanism of systemic renin activation could lead to novel strategies to prevent
HFrEF progression and death. We recently discovered a novel harmful role of proteinase Factor XIIa (FXIIa) in
HFrEF. We hypothesized that in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), FXIIa contributes to the development of
progressive HF in vivo and that the adverse effects of FXIIa may be mediated through its enzymatic cleavage of
pro-renin in circulation. To confirm or refute our hypotheses, we will combine enzymology, biomarker analysis,
and HFrEF modeling in vivo with relevance to human disease. To understand the mechanism of FXIIa in DCM-
HF, we will imply FXII-targeting molecular interventions and perform randomized, blinded trials to longitudinally
evaluate cardiac dysfunction, edema, cachexia, and other detrimental physiological outcomes and clinically-
relative biomarkers of HFrEF. We will explore our hypotheses in two Specific Aims: 1) define the newly
discovered role of FXIIa in modulating the progression of DCM and HFrEF; 2) test the hypothesis that in DCM,
FXIIa enhances the progression of HFrEF through increased levels of PRA to activate RAAS. Completing the
proposed study will define the mechanisms of FXIIa’s contribution to HFrEF and discover novel therapeutic
strategies needed to block or prevent the progression of HFrEF."
10983056,"ABSTRACT
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in patients with refractory
epilepsy. SUDEP is second only to stroke in years of potential life lost to neurological disease and is a
major public health problem. Several etiologies have been proposed for SUDEP including cardiac and
respiratory dysregulation. Another that is postulated is impaired arousal. Seizures impair arousal. Among
arousal stimuli, one that may be particularly relevant to SUDEP is CO2. CO2 rises following seizures and
is part of the seizure cessation mechanism. Seizures are frequently associated with ictal and post-ictal
central and obstructive apneas. Apnea further exacerbates the accumulation of CO2. Impairment of CO2-
arousal is proposed as an etiological factor in another sudden death entity, sudden infant death
syndrome, which has many parallels with SUDEP. We discovered that seizures impaired CO2-arousal in
seizure naïve mice and those that do not have a particularly profound death rate. Whether this is true in
mouse models with strong SUDEP phenotypes is unknown. Thus, our goal in this proposal is to determine
how seizures in different sleep states impair CO2-arousal in mouse models of temporal lobe epilepsy
(TLE) and the genetic epileptic encephalopathy, Dravet Syndrome (DS). In Aim 1 we will determine the
extent to which CO2-arousal is impaired in epilepsy models. We will focus on the pilocarpine-TLE model
as many patients that die of SUDEP have TLE, and the DS model, as patients with DS have a
disproportionately high SUDEP risk. We will also determine whether simply having epilepsy in these
models impairs CO2-arousal as a potential easily measurable biomarker for SUDEP risk. In Aim 2 we will
determine whether neuronal function, assessed via fiber photometry, of arousal system components in
the dorsal raphe nucleus and parabrachial nucleus, two important contributors to sleep-wake regulation
and key nodes in CO2-arousal, is impaired by seizures and epilepsy. In Aim 3 we will determine whether
optogenetically stimulating a DRN-PBN circuit in DS mice, using a novel mouse model, prior to seizures
prevents seizure-induced death lending direct insights into possible therapeutic measures. Since the
models employed have known death rates, we will be able to compare findings between mice that die
and those that survive making these studies more relevant to SUDEP. Combining these findings with our
previous work, we will have a powerful, rigorous, translatable approach to identify convergent and
divergent mechanisms across models for how impaired CO2-arousal in epilepsy contributes to SUDEP
risk. We expect to be able to leverage these mechanisms to identify at-risk individuals and reduce death
from this devastating disease."

This proposal describes a research and training program to advance my academic career in biofilm treatment
and facilitate my transition towards independence. Over the past years, I have acquired a broad scientific
background and extensive research experience in multiple fields, including synthesis of nanomaterials,
chemistry, substrate-based nanocrystals, nanomedicine, in vitro and in vivo imaging. My long-term career goal
is to develop nanomaterials with different shapes, sizes, and compositions for biofilm-associated diseases. This
proposal was therefore designed to strengthen and diversify my nanomaterial synthesis and characterization
skills, complementing them with training in infection diseases and therapies.
During my postdoctoral training period, I have developed a unique structure termed Wulff in cage
nanoparticles (WICN) that integrate the competencies of both cage and core structures to allow their use as
contrast agents for photoacoustic imaging, computed tomography and photothermal therapy (PTT). Using these
structures, I have shown that their PTT properties are critically affected by shape, size and the plasmonic
properties of nanoparticles. Therefore, systematically studying the therapeutics applications of these unique
morphologies, particularly towards infection diseases, is an imperative step towards improving nanotherapeutics.
To that end, here I propose to exploit new photothermal nanoparticles (PTNP) with nanoshell, nanocage or
nanoframe morphologies and different compositions (Ag, Au, Pt, and Pd) which enhance photothermal behavior
and result in effective and rapid dental caries, wound and skin infection treatments (Aim 1, K99). This
photothermal effect of nanoparticles enables both precise spatial control and whole tissue irradiation, while being
a rapid treatment. The developed morphologies will be used to examine the anti-biofilm efficacy and
biocompatibility of the PTNP in vitro. In this aim, PTNP will be assessed for their antibacterial properties to reduce
oral and wound infections while accelerating the photoablation rates (Aim 2, K99-R00), I will select the most
effective formulation to follow the in vivo research in (Aim 3, R00). The knowledge acquired in Aims 1 and 2 will
be applied to enhance the photothermal ablation of biofilms in vivo as a flexible, fast and low cost treatment
method. We will test PTNP in an animal model using rodent models of dental caries and excisional wound model
to investigate the effect of light and heat generation on biofilms in vivo. We will confirm that photothermal
treatment and the anti-biofilm effect of developed structures could be a substitute to the use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics to heal wound infection, prevent dental caries and kill the bacteria while irradiating with NIR light.
To guide me in this undertaking, I have assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team. At University of
Pennsylvania, Dr. Cormode (Primary Mentor, a leading scientist in Nanomedicine) from the Radiology
department , Dr. Koo (Co-mentor, biofilm-associated oral diseases expert) from the Department of Orthodontics
and Dr. Grice (Co-mentor, biofilm-associated skin diseases expert) from the Department of Dermatology will
continue mentoring me on in vitro and in vivo experiments. They will support my research activities and also
guide my transition to independence. These departments will provide resources and support to conduct
laboratory research, and foster my career development to achieve my goals."

 The legalization of cannabis in several states across the US has increased the need to better understand
its effects on the body, brain, and behavior. Rodent models are particularly valuable in this respect because they
provide precise control over external variables and the rodent brain shows structural and functional homology
with the human brain in regions relevant to drug dependence and emotional behavior. However, obstacles to
establishing preclinical animal models that more closely resemble human patterns of cannabis use have limited
our ability to study the biological consequences of real-world cannabis use and misuse. To address this critical
barrier in the field, the McLaughlin Laboratory recently developed and validated a novel vapor inhalation model
for delivering cannabis extracts in an experimenter-controlled or response-contingent manner in rats. Although
this model has provided valuable opportunities for examining cannabis-seeking behavior, the relatively limited
genetic toolkit available in rats has hindered the use of cell type- and circuit-specific approaches. Conversely,
the cutting-edge genetic tools available in mice make them an attractive model for studying how cannabis use
impacts various biological endpoints in the brain and periphery. To implement an ecologically valid mouse model
of cannabis use, we must first establish optimal cannabis vapor dosing parameters across conditions of age,
sex, and strain and determine the feasibility of self-administration in mice to ensure replicability for future studies.
Thus, the objective of this R21 proposal is to establish this model of cannabis use in inbred and outbred strains
of male and female mice during adolescence and adulthood. In Aim 1, we will use an experimenter-controlled
cannabis vapor delivery approach to determine the pharmacokinetic and behavioral effects of cannabis vapor
exposure in inbred (C57BL/6) and outbred (CD-1) mouse strains of both sexes during adolescence and
adulthood. In Aim 2, we will use these dosing parameters to determine whether cannabis vapor supports stable
cannabis-seeking behaviors in mice of both sexes, ages, and strains. Together, these aims employ a technically
innovative approach and will establish vital working parameters that will afford rigorous characterization of the
pharmacokinetic and cannabimimetic effects of acute exposure to vaporized cannabis. Funding this R21
proposal will be the first step in generating necessary pilot data in mice that will support many future collaborative
proposals from our multidisciplinary group of investigators (McLaughlin, Delevich, and Hayashi). Moreover, it will
provide a valuable starting point for others in the WSU community and beyond that are interested in employing
cannabis vapor delivery approaches in mice."

Communication disorders (CDs) have long-term impacts on young children and can exacerbate health
inequities in marginalized communities, especially for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) children
who have experienced historical trauma. Dr. Joshuaa Allison-Burbank, a member of the Navajo Nation and
Acoma Pueblo, aims to become an independent developmental scientist who conducts rigorous mixed-methods
research with AI/AN children with CDs. He aims to investigate the language development of young AI/AN youth
and how to best support positive developmental trajectories and mental health while responding to the harmful
effects of structural racism that exists in early childhood programs. CDs are conditions causing difficulty
producing or understanding speech and/or language, including autism spectrum disorder, hearing impairment,
and primary developmental speech and language disorders, and are the most prevalent class of disability in
early childhood, affecting about 1 in 5 children before age 6. As communication skills are essential to academic
and social-emotional development, CDs in early childhood are consistently linked to long-term costs to health
and well-being. Therefore, it is vital that CDs be addressed early in childhood to foster healthy developmental
trajectories for young children from communities that experience disproportionate health inequities. Aligning with
the purpose of PA-21-071, this diversity supplement builds on research from the parent award, Project ASCEND,
to specifically explore inequities in federally funded IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) Part C early
intervention (EI) systems, specifically for AI/AN children. This diversity supplement aims to identify and disrupt
sources of structural inequity (e.g., differential referral, historical trauma, racism, and funding limitations) in early
care for AI/AN children with CDs to provide solutions that improve equity in EI programs, and support child and
family health outcomes. This supplement's goal will be to evaluate aggregated data on AI/AN families utilizing
IDEA Part C systems' data and interviews with AI/AN families and providers serving AI/AN families to identify
actionable steps in EI where inequity can be disrupted. In addition, there is limited data on how AI/AN families
who live on tribal lands specifically are accessing and experiencing EI programs. Understanding how AI/AN
families are navigating EI systems on tribal lands can help us to better understand the unique sociocultural
factors that influence developmental outcomes of young AI/AN children. Most critical is addressing CDs in AI/AN
families where the incidence of CDs is high. Our analysis will determine how access to community resources
and geographic factors can influence provision of EI services for AI/AN families, which can help the research
team to address structural factors that impact access to EI services through research and advocacy. This mixed
methods study includes the largest-ever analysis of available EI service use data for AI/AN child (N =
approximately 2050) in Arizona, Oregon, Indiana, Minnesota, and Florida (5 partner states with data on AI/AN
children) in conjunction with AI/AN families and providers."
10999871,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition characterized by affective instability,
interpersonal dysfunction, and impulsive and self-harming behaviors. Individuals with BPD often make
disadvantageous decisions in response to negative interpersonal events, yet little is known about decision
processes that precipitate maladaptive behaviors. The past two decades of neuroscience research has
provided overwhelming evidence that decision-making can be understood in terms of Pavlovian and goal-
directed computational systems that are implemented in specific cortical-striatal-limbic circuits. Supported by
our preliminary data, we propose that in BPD, the cingulo-opercular network’s role in goal-directed learning is
vulnerable to disruptions by social-emotional cues that exert Pavlovian influences on decision-making.
Although BPD has historically been diagnosed in adults, symptoms often emerge in adolescence and their
severity may peak in early adulthood. The maturation of the cingulo-opercular network from adolescence to
early adulthood underlies developmental improvements in the integration of motivationally salient cues with
goal-directed behavior. We will test the hypothesis that in BPD, both approach- and avoidance-related
Pavlovian computations dominate the cingulo-opercular network via the phylogenetically old pathway from the
central nucleus of the amygdala to the nucleus accumbens core, which underpins emotion-driven Pavlovian
responses. The proposed case-control study will characterize abnormalities in Pavlovian and goal-directed
decision-making in 49 young adults with BPD symptoms compared to 49 matched individuals with social
anxiety disorder and 49 healthy controls. Studying these processes in early adulthood is essential because
BPD symptoms change rapidly during this period, which may reflect neurodevelopmental maturation of
emotion- and decision-related circuits. At the behavioral level, we will characterize participants using a decision
battery and corresponding hierarchical Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) models that span social and
nonsocial contexts (Aim 1). We will link decision signals, particularly the effects of social cues on goal-directed
learning, with their neurocomputational correlates using Bayesian RL models and model-based fMRI analyses
(Aim 2). Finally, to characterize separable circuits involved in maladaptive Pavlovian computations in BPD, we
will conduct a high-resolution resting-state fMRI study of the integration of the cingulo-opercular network with
specific limbic and striatal regions (Aim 3). Altogether, our computational psychiatry approach builds on the
unique strengths of our investigative team in BPD and neurodevelopment (Hallquist), Bayesian methodology
(Oravecz), and decision neuroscience (Hallquist, Dombrovski). This work aligns well with the NIMH Strategic
Plan for Research objectives to describe the neural circuits underlying mental illness (Strategy 1.1) and to
identify biomarkers and behavioral indicators that predict change in illness (Strategy 2.2)."
10996441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this proposal is to define how novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histones are
regulated by neuronal activity and to test their role in learning and memory. In the brain, gene expression
changes facilitate essential neural processes such as memory formation. PTMs like acetylation are known to
regulate these processes. This proposal focuses on crotonylation, a recently discovered histone PTM in the acyl
family. Histone crotonylation impacts gene expression in multiple cell types, generally upregulating expression.
While it is not yet clear whether histone crotonylation also regulates neuronal gene expression and function,
there is evidence showing that it can influence the development of psychological disorders as well as
neurodevelopmental disorders. For instance, several acetyl-lysine readers have a specific preference for
crotonyl-lysine over acetyl-lysine, and mutations in the genes encoding these proteins cause
neurodevelopmental syndromes characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disability. Thus,
understanding the regulation and function of histone crotonylation in the brain has the potential to illuminate
mechanisms by which epigenetic regulators influence disease. To date, the study of crotonylation has been
hindered by a lack of specificity in the reagents that detect crotonylation and by a lack of tools to specifically
manipulate it in physiological contexts. This proposal will leverage novel tools including a crotonyl-specific probe
and crotonyl-specific enzymes to gain an understanding of how histone crotonylation is regulated by neural
activity and to discern how it functions in the regulation of gene expression and in learning and memory.
 This proposal presents two integrated aims to test the overarching hypothesis that histone crotonylation
enhances transcription of activity-dependent genes to promote learning and memory formation. In Aim 1, we will
use primary neuronal culture systems to study how neuronal activation affects histone crotonylation over time.
The novel approaches used in this Aim will map the broad, dynamic changes in crotonylation induced by neuronal
activation while also quantifying site-specific histone residues with altered crotonylation status during neuronal
activation. In Aim 2, we will utilize viral vectors to express mutant forms of histone acyl- and deacyl-transferase
enzymes that specifically deposit or remove crotonylation. We will use these enzymes in neuronal cultures to
determine how changes in histone crotonylation affect gene expression in response to activating stimuli. We will
also test whether crotonylation plays a functional role in learning and memory in mice by injecting lentiviruses
expressing crotonyl-specific acyltransferase enzymes under the control of a neuron-specific promoter to increase
or decrease crotonylation. We will then evaluate the effects of these manipulations on memory through
behavioral testing. Ultimately this proposal will define how histone crotonylation is regulated in neurons and how
it functions in transcriptional regulation underlying memory formation in the brain, expanding our understanding
of how epigenetic regulators shape cognitive processes."
10996324,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The supramammillary area (SuM) is increasingly appreciated for its role in a variety of functions, including
spatial and social novelty processing via its connections with the hippocampus. Specifically, the SuM has
projections to the CA2 and ventral dentate gyrus (DG), believed to be important for social processing, and to
the dorsal DG, believed to be important for spatial and contextual processing. The hippocampus provides
direct inhibitory input to the SuM, but the nature and function of this connectivity is completely unknown. The
studies outlined in the proposal would provide important basic science groundwork for understanding this
connectivity, with ultimate potential impacts for better understanding and treating a range of neurological
disorders, including but not limited to temporal lobe epilepsy. This includes examining the hippocampal
neurons providing the inhibitory input to the SuM, examining which subpopulations of SuM neurons receive
inhibitory hippocampal input, and the in vivo impact of manipulation of inhibitory hippocampal inputs to the
SuM. Based on our preliminary data, we predict that there are at least two populations of hippocampal
inhibitory neurons projecting to the SuM -- one expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and the other
expressing somatostatin – located in each region and along the entire anterior-posterior axis of the
hippocampus. We further predict the greatest number in the CA3 region. We predict, and our preliminary data
supports, that both SuM cells projecting to the ventral DG and SuM cells projecting to the dorsal DG receive
inhibitory hippocampal inputs. Importantly, we see the strongest connectivity so far from the ventral
hippocampus to SuM neurons projecting to the dorsal DG, arguing against a simple feedback inhibitory role of
this connection. To examine the function of inhibitory hippocampal inputs to the SuM in vivo, we will use
fiberphotometry to record from projection-defined SuM populations, during an assortment of behavioral tests,
while providing closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of inhibitory hippocampal inputs specifically at the time of
object or conspecific investigations. Collectively, the data will provide important insights into the nature of
hippocampal inhibitory inputs to the SuM, including the degree to which specific SuM populations are targeted,
and the functional significance of this connectivity, including as relates to social and spatial processing."

More than 71% of individuals with developmental disabilities are being cared for by familial caregivers, and this
caregiving often extends beyond childhood. It is estimated that 5.5 million people aged 18 and older in the
United States are diagnosed with autism, a number that is expected to increase with rising prevalence rates.
Individuals with autism and very substantial support needs (level 3), also known as profound autism, often
have co-occurring severe intellectual disability, little to no functional communication, and require 24 hour-a-day
care. It is estimated that those with high support needs encompass up to 48% of the spectrum. Many
caregivers are family members, often an aging parent. Parents face many challenges in raising children with
autism, such as lack of resources, lack of support, and financial strain. It is not well known how these
challenges continue or change as the child becomes an adult, and the caregiving needs continue and often
increase. With an economic value estimated at 600 billion dollars, informal familial caregiving is a crucial
component to the healthcare system in the United States. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to better
understand how social determinants of health, caregiving factors, and care-recipient factors impact parental
caregiver quality of life and explore the context and relationship of these factors in-depth to create a better
understanding of the caregivers’ experiences. The proposed research seeks to utilize an explanatory
sequential mixed methods design to better understand the caregiver’s experience. Previous research
highlights the need for increased and improved research into the quality of life of parental caregivers as
improved caregiver quality of life can lead to improved outcomes for the adult-child with profound autism. To
successfully accomplish this research and my future career goals, a training plan with three key areas has
been developed: 1) expand my knowledge of mixed methods study design, data collection, and analysis, 2)
deepen my understanding of caregiving science and how it can be used to understand the needs of those
caring for adults living with autism, 3) strengthen my scientific writing and presenting skills. An interdisciplinary
mentorship team and the strong research infrastructure at Penn State will support the project and my career
development."

Podocyte abnormalities have been identified in many kidney diseases. The structural role of podocytes in the
filtration barrier is known to be a dynamic process in which the podocyte actively restructures its actin
cytoskeleton. Mechanical stress, such as severe hypertension, can have a detrimental impact on this process.
LIM-nebulette is an actin binding protein within podocytes. We hypothesize that this protein helps podocytes
adapt to the mechanical microenvironment in vivo. We have engineered an instrument with deformable surfaces
to simulate the mechanical tensile forces experienced by podocytes in vivo. The goal of this project is to combine
high-content image analysis with a novel mechanical stretch platform to understand how podocytes maintain
their structural integrity against injury and use this system to study the operation of an important cell signaling
pathway in the glomerular environment. Stretched and control samples will also be collected for fluorescent
microscopy, protein expression, phosphproteomics and co-immunopreciptation to determine nebulette’s
signaling network. Understanding the role of LIM-nebulette in maintaining podocyte cytoskeletal integrity could
potentially reveal new avenues for stabilizing these cells and, consequently, preserving kidney function. By
compiling and analyzing this data, we aim to clarify the role of LIM-nebulette in protecting podocytes. This project
will yield cellular level insights into podocyte activity under glomerular environmental stress conditions by
examining morphometric changes and alterations in mechanobiological signaling that may have an impact on
chronic kidney disease."

The axolotl salamander is capable of perfect, scar-free regeneration throughout its body. In order to regenerate
a complex biological structure such as a limb, cells at the site of injury must correctly re-establish axial patterns
such that only the missing tissues regenerate. Retinoic acid (RA) is a pleiotropic morphogen that has long been
studied for its roles in development and regeneration. Intracellular RA can, broadly, be secreted to neighboring
cells, catabolized in the cytoplasm by cytochrome P450 family 26 (CYP26) proteins, or imported to the nucleus.
In the nucleus, RA binds to its family of receptors (RARs) at retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) located in
the promoters of RA-responsive genes. Upon RA binding to RARs, local chromatin remodels to modify
transcription of the primary target. Inhibiting RA breakdown by CYP26 reprograms regenerating distal cells to a
proximal state in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a gradient of RA concentration along the proximodistal
axis maintained by differential RA catabolism. Despite decades of study, few primary targets of RA signaling
have been confirmed, and the exact genetic mechanisms by which RA establishes a proximodistal axis remain
under studied. In addition, connective tissue fibroblasts have been found to be key drivers of axial re-
establishment in regeneration, but their ability to store and confer positional “memory” upon injury is not well
understood. Previous work has also demonstrated that fibroblasts are specifically responsive to supplemental
RA. From these foundational studies, I hypothesize that differential chromatin compaction promoted by RA
signaling in connective tissue fibroblasts establishes the regenerating limb’s proximodistal axis. The proposed
project intends to elucidate the epigenetic regulation by RA signaling in fibroblasts and its spatiotemporal
progression during regeneration through two specific aims. Aim 1 is to use single-nuclear multiomic sequencing
to generate fibroblast-specific candidate genes with putative RAREs and test their responsiveness to RA. Aim 2
is to functionally test candidates through assaying the regulatory activity of RA-responsive genes and functional
ablation of normal RA-driven transcriptional regulation. The proposed experiments will provide deeper insight
into the molecular role of RA in connective tissue fibroblasts that generates proximodistal positional identity
during axolotl limb regeneration. The findings from these experiments will enhance our understanding of the
regulatory conditions behind complex tissue regeneration which promote successful regeneration in some
species, such as the axolotl, but not in humans. These studies will potentially generate novel targets for
regenerative therapies in humans, whose regenerative capacity is largely limited to the distal-most digit tip."

Nearly 400,000 people with an opioid use disorder (OUD) receive OUD treatment each year (19.7% of all
people with an OUD). Community re-entry following residential OUD treatment is a critically vulnerable time, as
risk of return to use, overdose, and death are increased in the 30 days following discharge.
Continuity of care
during re-entry is vital in supporting recovery outcomes, but little is known about treatment utilization during this
high-risk period. Individual and socio-structural factors can influence treatment utilization; however, there is a
dearth of information regarding the factors that predict treatment utilization during re-entry. Characterizing
treatment utilization and identifying predictors of treatment engagement is necessary to detect those who are
at risk for not engaging with treatment during community re-entry and thus address critical gaps in the OUD
treatment pipeline. By defining treatment broadly, inclusive of harm reduction strategies, and combining
intensive longitudinal methods (ecological momentary assessment [EMA]) with innovative machine learning
analyses, this study will both characterize treatment utilization with greater precision and improve prediction of
treatment engagement during community re-entry. Our findings aim to identify (in residential OUD treatment)
those at risk for not engaging with treatment during community re-entry (to inform preventative interventions)
as well as to pinpoint proximal facilitators and barriers to treatment utilization during community re-entry.
 The proposed secondary data analysis aims to characterize treatment utilization and identify individual and
structural facilitators and barriers to, and predictors of, OUD treatment during community re-entry. The target
population is adults with OUD who discharged from residential OUD treatment (N=150). This study uses
innovative methods and cutting-edge data analyses to maximize existing data from the Sponsor’s NIH-funded
study (P20GM125507). Aim 1 uses EMA to accurately and reliably describe experiences with treatment
utilization during community re-entry. Aim 2 applies innovative machine learning modeling approaches to 1)
socio-structural and clinical data gathered during residential treatment to identify those at risk for not engaging
with treatment during community re-entry, and 2) symptoms and behaviors gathered during community re-entry
with EMA to identify facilitators and barriers to treatment utilization the re-entry period. Findings will inform
continuity of care, evidence-based tools to prevent and/or delay return to opioid use, and reduce harms
associated with community re-entry. This proposal addresses critical gaps in my training and knowledge
and will be necessary to develop an independent, NIH-funded research program focused on opioid use
and OUD treatment utilization during high-risk transitional periods, such as community re-entry."
10997574,"Project Summary/Abstract: Over 130,000 Puerto Ricans have migrated to the US since Hurricane María in 2017.
They comprise a growing population of individuals and families who migrate due to threats on their life, safety, or
health (henceforth referred to as crisis migrants). The number of crisis migrants being displaced by cascading
disasters—the accumulation of damage and crises without the capacity to recover from the previous one—is
increasing due to climate change. Studies on the mental health of crisis migrant adults have identified many
challenges faced by displaced individuals, including but not limited to, language barriers, healthcare disruptions,
unemployment, food insecurity, and residential instability. However, research on crisis migrant mental health has
focused primarily on the time immediately following resettlement, with little known about longer-term outcomes.
There is also evidence that the effects of cascading disasters on child mental health are strongly influenced by the
response of adult caregivers, underscoring the need for longitudinal research on crisis migration within family units.
Puerto Ricans currently make up an estimated 5.4% of the Florida population, which is the largest concentration of
Puerto Ricans outside of the island. In the context of crisis migration to the US, very little is known about relationships
between basic needs insecurity, mental health, and family dynamics over time. The proposed R36 will be the first
known study to examine relationships between residential instability, neighborhood cohesion and safety, mental
health, and family functioning of Spanish-speaking crisis migrants in the US. The long-term goal of this research is to
inform policy priorities to improve the mental health and address basic needs of crisis migrant families who
experienced cascading disasters.
The specific aims of this R36 are: (1) To examine how the contextual stressors of residential instability and
neighborhood cohesion and safety predict mental health over time among Puerto Rican crisis migrant adults; (2) To
identify, using latent class growth (LCG) modeling, (a) subgroups by parent/child perceptions of family functioning
and contextual stressors, and (b) their combined influence on individual mental health outcomes; and (3) To explore,
using in-depth qualitative data, the roles of residential instability and neighborhood cohesion and safety in shaping
the lived experiences and family well-being of Puerto Rican crisis migrants. The proposed research is innovative as it
is the first known study to use a mixed methods design to understand residential instability, family dynamics, and
mental health of Puerto Rican crisis migrants. It is significant as results can inform development of evidence-based
interventions and policies to reduce mental health disparities and improve system-level resources for crisis migrant
families who experience cascading disasters. Given the expected rise in climate-related migration, this work is
particularly relevant and timely."

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a condition involving pathologic bone formation in extra-skeletal soft tissues (e.g.
tendons, ligaments, muscle) which can occur following orthopaedic surgeries or injuries such as high impact
trauma and burns. There is an unmet clinical need to develop effective therapies to treat HO, particularly at early
stages post-injury. In this proposed project, our objective is to explore small RNA targeting approaches
(microRNA, siRNA) in a clinically relevant mouse model of trauma-induced HO to: i) develop and test new
nanoparticle-based strategies to treat this debilitating condition, and ii) advance our understanding of the
mechanisms driving HO and identify new potential therapeutic targets.
 From an unbiased microarray study to identify microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures in developing
long bones, we identified miR-138 as being differentially-expressed in distinct regions of the growth plate. We
subsequently showed that miR-138 has bone inhibitory function, including the ability to suppress HO in an
established trauma-induced HO mouse model. Additionally, we demonstrated that a major mechanism by which
miR-138 inhibits osteogenesis is by targeting and suppressing the cytoskeletal regulator, RhoC. We
subsequently showed that direct inhibition of RhoC could also inhibit osteogenesis. Whether or not knockdown
of RhoC alone can also dampen trauma-induced HO in vivo has yet to be investigated.
 Inflammation also plays a critical role in HO formation. Pilot data from our group show suppression of IL-
1-induced catabolic genes by either miR-138 over-expression or RhoC inhibition. In addition, p65 (a
transcription factor component of the NF-kB complex and an important regulator of inflammation) is another
reported target of miR-138, the function of which has not yet been examined in the context of HO. Taken together,
we hypothesize that strategies to modulate miR-138 activity (and its downstream targets) will result in
suppression of trauma-induced HO, including associated inflammation and pain, and also inform new
mechanisms regulating this pathologic process.
 Two specific aims are proposed to address our hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 is focused on developing a small
RNA targeting approach to suppress HO. The effects of over-expressing miR-138 or siRNAs targeting RhoC and
p65 will be tested in the trauma-induced HO mouse model. Nanoparticle-based technology will be utilized to
enhance translational RNA-targeting capabilities. In Specific Aim 2, a multi-omics approach will be used to
determine the effects of nanoparticle treatments and how genetic-based over-expression of miR-138 in specific
cell types can suppress HO. These studies will advance our knowledge on cellular processes driving HO, and
provide evidence to support new therapeutic approaches, involving small RNA nanoparticle targeting, as a
promising treatment for HO."
10997783,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Both healthy individuals and those with addictive disorders experience cravings, a strong urge for a particular
substance. Yet despite this and the recognized impact craving has on some individuals, such as those with food
addiction, leading to overconsumption of highly palatable, high-calorie/high-fat foods, little is known about the
neural mechanisms underlying craving and its impact on decision making. Past fMRI studies have identified
canonical value and emotion/interoceptive processing regions of the brain that are sensitive to craving. However,
these studies rely on cue-reactivity paradigms that do not examine subjective value computations, an essential
component of behavioral intent understood to dictate - and potentially bias - decision making under craving.
Work in my lab has shown craving scales subjective value (i.e., how much an individual feels an item is worth)
in a multiplicative manner along a similarity dimension. Meaning people disproportionately value a craved item
and those similar to it more than dissimilar items during craving. However, the precise neural mechanisms
supporting this biased increase in subjective value in food addiction remain unknown. To address this, I will
induce craving via a multisensory food activity and have subjects complete willingness-to-pay probes during
fMRI so I may track how individuals’ subjective value changes pre- and post-craving. Furthermore, I will use the
Yale Food Addiction Scale to select for normative (control) and addictive food consumption (food addiction)
subjects to compare how craving may differentially exert its effects in food addiction. In Aim 1, to test how craving
differentially exerts its effect in food addiction, I will examine how subjective value changes for craved and non-
craved foods pre- and post-craving induction with the hypothesis that the food addiction group will exhibit more
disproportionate increases in subjective value for both the craved snack and non-craved snacks compared to
controls who will display a more targeted effect. Furthermore, to determine what neural bases may be primed in
food addiction to produce these disproportionate increases in subjective value, in Aim 2 I will assess whether
patterns of neural activity (i.e., neural representations) for the value of the craved and non-craved snacks are
less distinct in food addiction compared to controls, serving to drive more generalized overconsumption. The
training and research outlined in this F31 application will enhance my predoctoral training by: (1) solidifying my
understanding of motivational and decision neuroscience (neuroeconomics) methods and theory and (2)
increasing my competency in craving and behavioral addictions. The activities planned are aimed at advancing
my theoretical understanding of how motivational states interact with decision making, neuroimaging skills, and
clinical knowledge, all of which will be essential to achieving Aims 1 and 2, results from which would provide
novel insights into the precise neural mechanisms that underlie craving in food addiction."
10998089,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neoadjuvant and perioperative chemoimmunotherapy are the standard of care for the treatment of patients with
resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Unfortunately, the majority of patients with resectable NSCLC
do not benefit from neoadjuvant/perioperative immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based therapies for reasons
that are unclear. Efforts to develop more effective treatment strategies that bypass therapeutic resistance have
been hampered by our limited understanding of the mechanisms that govern response to ICIs and that thus
could serve as validated biomarkers to guide neoadjuvant/perioperative ICI treatment. Our long-term objectives
are to develop rational neoadjuvant/perioperative combination therapies that prevent resistance and increase
benefit from ICI-based treatments. Recently, we analyzed NSCLCs from patients treated with chemotherapy
(CT) plus dual ICIs in the phase 2 NEOSTAR trial (PI: Cascone) and found those from responders contained
enhanced B cell fractions and markers of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) compared to nonresponders. These
findings were recapitulated when using neoadjuvant combinations of ICI plus novel immunomodulatory agents
in our recently reported phase 2 trial, NeoCOAST. To build on these observations from our clinical trials, we
performed preliminary spatial-omics analysis of a pilot cohort of NSCLCs from patients treated with neoadjuvant
CT+ICI and with varying response to therapy. We found that pathologic response was associated with
aggregation of B cells into organized structures (e.g., TLS) with elevated expression of anti-tumor B cell
signatures and enhanced cell-cell communication with the tumor immune microenvironment. Preclinically, we
found that neoadjuvant ICI-based therapy was the most effective treatment at reducing frequency of metastases
and prolonging survival in our human-relevant models of spontaneously metastatic NSCLC and therapeutic
efficacy was once again tightly coupled with enhanced B cell infiltration. Consequently, we hypothesize that B
cell transcriptional, immunogenomic, and spatial landscapes in neoadjuvant CT+ICI-treated NSCLC patients
differ by MPR, and that B cell-mediated cytotoxic antitumor responses, including their interaction with T cells,
augment the efficacy of neoadjuvant ICI-based therapy in early-stage NSCLC. We will test our hypothesis by
determining the transcriptional, immunogenomic, and spatial landscapes of B lineage cells in human NSCLC
treated with neoadjuvant ICI-based therapy (Aim 1); interrogating the impact of B cells on T cell-mediated
responses to neoadjuvant ICI-based therapy in murine models of NSCLC (Aim 2); and investigating the utility of
B cell-centric phenotypes in predicting benefit of neoadjuvant ICI-based therapy in resectable NSCLC from
unique clinical trials (Aim 3). This proposal will leverage a platform of unique, global clinical trial cohorts of
NSCLC, novel human-relevant mouse models of NSCLC, as well as state-of-the-art single-cell and spatial multi-
omics technologies to define the role of B cell lineages in antitumor responses to neoadjuvant ICIs and provide
a framework for the development of B cell-associated therapies aiming to cure a greater number of patients."

central nervous system (CNS), however how this happens has not been fully characterized. Olfactory sensory
neurons (OSNs) are neurons whose cell bodies are found within the nasal epithelium, sending projections though
the cribiform plate and onto the olfactory bulbs (OBs) within the CNS. These neurons endogenously sense
compounds in the air to transmit information to the CNS and form a potential direct route for nanoplastics to
travel from the nose to the brain. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize the nose-to-brain pathway that
nanoplastics can be transported into the brain, whether sex, inflammation, age, or known genetic risk factors for
cognitive decline and ADRDs (APOE3/4) influence this pathway, and how microglial dynamics change in vitro,
after intranasal nanoplastic exposure. The first set of experiments will use advanced histological techniques and
confocal microscopy to investigate the cells involved in this pathway and whether sex, age, genotype and
inflammation alter the rate of nanoplastic uptake. The second set of experiments will focus on understanding
microglial dynamics after intranasal exposure to nanoplastics through 2-photon microscopy and utilizing antibody
staining to further investigate microglial dynamics. Age, sex, genotype, and inflammation will be observed to
determine their influence on nanoplastic uptake into the CNS."

In the early stages of human pregnancy, cells from the developing placenta, termed extravillous trophoblast
(EVT) cells, must interact with the uterus. In other species including the rat, this special class of trophoblasts are
generically termed invasive trophoblast cells. The interaction between invasive trophoblast/EVT cells and the
uterus results in the necessary remodeling of spiral arteries to meet the increased demand of blood flow and
oxygen during pregnancy. Once remodeled, these arteries will integrate into the uterus to function in transporting
nutrients and waste to and from the fetus through the maternal bloodstream. Importantly, differentiation into these
specialized trophoblast cell types requires suppression of pathways essential for maintaining the trophoblast cell
stem state and activation of the invasive/EVT cell differentiation program. In this project, we investigate roles for
the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway in the
regulation of invasive/EVT cell development. Roles for LIF/STAT3 regulatory networks in human trophoblast
stem cell models are the focus of Specific Aim 1. In Specific Aim 2, we will leverage a Stat3 conditional rat model
to investigate STAT3 effects on the development and functionality of the invasive trophoblast cells at the uterine-
placental interface. Experimentation includes genome-wide analyses of the transcriptome and the chromatin
landscape. Completion of this research project will facilitate the discovery of molecular controllers responsible
for regulating invasive/EVT cell lineage as well as create a platform for understanding the pathogenesis of early
pregnancy loss. In addition, this proposal will provide the postdoctoral trainee with the mentorship, training, and
skills required to become a successful independent investigator dedicated to human fertility research."
10998579,"Project Summary:
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a solid tumor with limited treatment options and a dismal five-year
survival rate of only 12%, necessitating the development of improved therapeutics for this malignancy. While
cancer immunotherapy has shown promise in hematological malignancies and some solid tumors, the
application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in PDAC faces obstacles due to its unique
characteristics, including desmoplastic stroma and poor T cell infiltration (work by Dr. Lesinski, sponsor). To
overcome these challenges, we propose a groundbreaking approach: using CD4+ T cells expressing high levels
of the enzymatically active molecule CD26 and engineering them with a mesothelin-directed CAR. Previous work
from the Paulos lab (co-sponsor) has demonstrated that CD26 marks T cells with favorable properties, making
them an ideal template for CAR engineering. CD26's enzymatic activity in degrading immunosuppressive
peptides holds promise for remodeling the tumor microenvironment and limiting the myeloid-dominant features
in PDAC. We hypothesize that by engineering CD26+CD4+CAR T cells with a mesothelin-targeted CAR (Meso-
CAR), we can enhance PDAC immunotherapy efficacy. Preliminary data support this hypothesis, with
CD26+CD4+Meso-CAR T cells showing robust activity against PDAC and other mesothelin-positive tumors in
mice. Aim 1 of this grant will focus on assessing the impact of CD26+CD4+Meso-CAR T cells upon remodeling
the tumor microenvironment (TME), including chemokines and myeloid cells that are likely altered by the CD26
enzyme. We will use systemic inhibition and genetic knockout of CD26 to determine the importance of its
enzymatic activity in TME modulation. Aim 2 will elucidate how CD26+CD4+Meso-CAR T cells engage the
endogenous immune response and enhance the efficacy of co-administered, purified CD8+CAR T cells in both
immune-competent and immune-deficient mouse models. The rationale for both aims lies in understanding the
interactions between CD26+CD4+Meso-CAR T cells and the endogenous immune response within the complex
PDAC microenvironment. We propose to deepen this understanding by using congenic orthotopic mouse models
to systematically evaluate the efficacy of CD26+CD4+Meso-CAR T cells and/or CD8+Meso-CAR T cells with
variable CD26 activity (Aim 1) and with alterations in the endogenous host immune system presence (Aim 2).
The anticipated impact of our findings is significant, providing proof-of-principle pre-clinical data supporting the
development of CD26+CD4+ based cell therapy approaches for PDAC patients. Because CD26's enzymatic
action on immunosuppressive peptides may mitigate myeloid-dominant features in PDAC tumors, this approach
offers a promising avenue to improve outcomes in other challenging solid tumors. While we utilize mesothelin
as the target antigen in this proposal, the approach is adaptable to other antigens or neoantigens in PDAC and
other solid tumors. Collectively, we seek to validate and characterize an innovative CD26+CAR T cell therapy as
a platform that can be used to revolutionize solid tumor immunotherapies in the future."

One of the challenges facing treatment of people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) is determining
their likelihood of progression. This is critical since it influences risk-benefit and therapy
selection. We are validating objective state-of-the-art MRI methods (e.g. separation of myelin vs
iron-based signal [chi [ꭓ] separation] with quantitative magnetic susceptibility mapping [QSM],
quantitative T1 lesion mapping [QT1M], multi-shell diffusion MRI [dMRI], and tensor-valued
dMRI) to estimate CNS tissue microstructure (myelin, axons, iron laden microglia [ILM]) to
elucidate mechanisms of neurodegeneration in pwMS, and their clinical relevance, to monitor
and predict MS disease progression. In the past cycle of this grant we demonstrated that
anterograde trans‐synaptic degeneration (TSD) is a mechanism of neurodegeneration after
acute optic neuritis in pwMS that is associated with worse visual outcomes. We have also found
that some pwMS with posterior visual pathway (PVP) lesions exhibit anatomically correlating
homonymous hemi-macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) atrophy (HHA) on
optical coherence tomography (OCT), consistent with retrograde TSD. We found utilizing novel
MRI sequences that oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
(CMRO2) are abnormal in pwMS consistent with cerebral metabolic dysfunction, and that retinal
OCT angiography (OCTA) derived superficial venous plexus (SVP) density provides insight into
cerebral metabolic function. In this current study, we will determine the relevance of TSD in
pwMS, the microstructural features of PVP lesions that cause vs. do not cause TSD, and how
demyelination, metabolic dysfunction, vascular integrity, and axonal loss in the brain and retina
are inter-connected, and their clinical relevance. This will allow the development of novel
outcomes for assessing neuroprotection, remyelination, and ILM in clinical trials and precision
care. Our hypotheses are that HHA is a marker of retrograde TSD that occurs due to destructive
PVP lesions; QSM-based ꭓ separation into positive (ILM) and negative (myelin) susceptibility
provides additional information to QT1M (lesion myelin); and that reduced OEF, CMRO2 and
SVP density identify hypometabolism/neuronal dysfunction. Aim 1: To determine whether TSD
is a predictor of whole brain atrophy and a signature of worsening MS. Aim 2: To determine
whether the microstructural components of neurodegeneration can be estimated within and
distant (TSD) to lesions, and if this predicts global neurodegeneration and future disability in
pwMS. Aim 3: To determine whether reduced OEF, CMRO2, and retinal SVP density are
indicators of metabolic stress that precede neurodegeneration and disability progression in MS."
10980205,"Falls are a major problem for people with Parkinson disease (PD). Falls and their sequelae are the leading cause of hospitalizations, precipitate institutionalization, and increase mortality in PD. No available therapy markedly mitigates fall risk and fall reduction is a major unmet therapeutic need in PD. A considerable body of clinical and preclinical research links fall risk, impaired cognition, particularly impaired attentional function, and brain cholinergic deficits in PD. Approximately two thirds of people with PD at a moderate stage have cortical cholinergic deficits detectable in vivo with [18F]FEOBV positron emission tomography (PET). In broad terms, cholinergic projection system impairments correlate with mild cognitive features in PD and gait impairments, but cholinergic therapeutic development has been hampered to date by the non-specific effects of currently available cholinesterase inhibitors and clinical trial designs that failed to target biologically and functionally relevant outcomes in participants at greatest risk. Preclinical research suggests that stimulation of α4β2 nicotinic cholinergic receptors would enhance attention and diminish fall risk. We performed a successful target engagement study of the α4β2 nicotinic agonist varenicline (VCN; Chantix) in PET confirmed hypo cholinergic PD participants. VCN treatment was well tolerated, had high α4β2 receptor occupancy, and produced relevant physiologic effects on gait and attention including reduced dual tasking cost during normal pace (npDTC) walking. We propose a single-site phase II trial in PD participants with Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) to address a rigorous go/no-go rule determining if a multi-center large scale efficacy trial is justified. PD-MCI participants will be screened with [18F]FEOBV PET at the time of enrollment and only hypo cholinergic subjects will be randomized. In a double-masked, parallel-group trial of VCN vs placebo in PD-MCI participants, our primary endpoint will be the durability of VCN’s effect on relevant gait-attentional dual tasking performance. An important secondary endpoint will be 1 year fall reduction in the range of the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). We will explore the effect of the randomized varenicline intervention on a novel hierarchical composite endpoint of fall-related injuries, falls, and near-falls over 12 months as a future potential endpoint for fall intervention trials in PD. If our hypotheses are verified, we will have critical evidence to justify a multicenter phase III efficacy trial of VCN for fall risk mitigation in PD. Even with a negative outcome, we will introduce and test novel methods for future clinical trials aimed at fall risk mitigation in PD."
10981958,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our project is to elucidate the molecular basis of the poorly understood mechanism of
the RNA synthesis machinery of NNS RNA viruses and to determine the structures of key protein complexes
involved in the RSV RNA synthesis, facilitating the development of antiviral drugs. Despite several decades of
research, the molecular mechanism of RNA synthesis by NNS RNA viruses remains elusive. The catalytic core
of the RNA synthesis machine of NNS RNA viruses is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that
comprises a large 250 kDa protein (L) and a cofactor phosphoprotein (P). The L protein catalyzes three
enzymatic activities: nucleotide polymerization, cap addition, and cap methylation. P is essential for the full
activity of L to act on the viral genome. In some cases, additional viral proteins (VP30 in Ebola and M2-1 in RSV)
are necessary for full RdRP processivity. Several important and long-standing questions for RNA synthesis
by NNS RNA viruses remain unanswered - First, how does L carry out the catalytic reactions of the
phosphodiester bond formation of the first two nucleotides (de novo RNA synthesis), RNA elongation (RNA
extension), and RNA polyadenylation (shutter mechanism)? Second, how does a single protein L coordinate
three distinct enzymatic activities (makes, caps, and methylates RNA), and what determines the switch to the
next process? Third, how do the cofactor P and transcription factor M2-1 regulate the activities of the L protein?
The lack of clear answers to these critical questions represents a major knowledge gap in our understanding
of the mechanism of NNS RNA synthesis. We propose to tackle these challenging questions with a novel hybrid
approach that integrates biochemistry, enzymology, mutagenesis, virology, genetics, crystallography, and cryo-
EM methods. Guided by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the catalytic activities of RNA polymerization,
cap addition, and cap methylation reside within RSV L and that L requires a dynamic assembly with P and M2-
1 to coordinate these activities during RNA synthesis. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate the functional
interplay between the multi-functional enzyme L, cofactor P, and transcription factor M2-1. We will seek to
provide clear answers to the long-standing questions regarding the mechanisms governing RNA synthesis of
RSV and other NNS RNA viruses. The proposed research is significant and groundbreaking because the novel
knowledge and structures obtained from this proposed research will significantly advance our understanding of
RSV and NNS RNA synthesis. Ultimately, such knowledge will provide a framework for developing novel
antivirals to treat RSV infections."

Precision environmental health focuses on individual risk assessment to inform targeted disease prevention strate­
gies. Identifying individuals with increased sensitivity to environmental exposures is especially challenging with
mixture exposures. The health effects of exposure to mixtures are likely to depend on the composition of the
mixture, characteristics specific to the espoused individual including individual­ and neighborhood­level factors,
and the developmental stage at which an individual is exposed. We propose to develop statistical methods for
precision environmental health with mixture exposures. The proposed methods will estimate mixture­exposure­
response relationships that are individualized based on multiple candidate modifying factors. The framework we
develop will allow for data­driven discovery of novel combinations of individual­ and neighborhood­level factors
that define susceptible subgroups. We will address three specific data settings. In Aim 1 we propose a general
framework for effect heterogeneity using established mixture methods including Bayesian multiple index models.
This will include heterogeneous versions of Bayesian kernel machine regression and linear index models. In Aim
2 we develop methods to identify critical windows of susceptibility to mixtures that are assessed longitudinally.
The methods will allow for identification of individualized windows of susceptibility to a mixture and estimation of
individualized mixture­exposure­time­response functions. In Aim 3 we develop heterogeneous mixture methods
for multiple outcomes. The multiple outcome methods will apply to trajectories defined by repeated measures of
common endpoint or pathway as well as shared information across multiple related endpoints, such as multiple
measures of a common pathway. In Aim 4 we will develop software to implement the methods, along with vignettes
and tutorials. We will use the methods developed to analyze air pollution mixtures in a large administrative birth
cohort and in a Northeastern United States longitudinal perinatal cohort drawing from multiple source populations.
We will estimate individualized mixture­exposure­response functions for birth weight and multiple neurodevelop­
mental endpoints assessed at multiple times. The methods we develop will allow for new avenues of precision
environmental health to better identify individuals at increased risk of adverse effects of the environment, which
will better inform targeted disease prevention strategies."
10981586,"Collagen is the most abundant protein in animals, constituting up to one-third of total protein in humans.
As the major proteinaceous component of tissues ranging from bone and skin to cartilage and basement mem-
branes, it constitutes the molecular scaffold for animal life. This ubiquitous protein is uniquely challenging for
cells to produce, requiring highly coordinated intracellular processes of synthesis, folding, assembly, and qual-
ity control. Owing to the hierarchical nature of collagenous extracellular matrices, the physical and biochemical
properties of such tissues are fundamentally defined by these upstream, intracellular processes. Defects,
whether genetic or otherwise, that are detrimental to any aspect of collagen proteostasis can impact the health
or function of collagen-producing cells and also propagate to extracellular matrices, leading to diseases known
as the collagenopathies. Unfortunately, these diseases almost universally lack effective, disease-modifying
therapies.
 Current therapeutic approaches to the collagenopathies focus on regenerative interventions, efforts to
strengthen the extracellular matrix itself, or palliative care. None of these strategies aims to address the up-
stream issue leading to disease: a failure to properly fold and quality control collagen molecules themselves. If
the breakdown of collagen proteostasis could be effectively addressed, the downstream symptoms targeted by
current clinical strategies would be alleviated. Indeed, proteostasis enhancement has proven remarkably effi-
cacious in many other genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis, but it has yet to make serious inroads in the
collagenopathies. One obstacle is inadequate understanding of the critical decision points in the collagen pro-
teostasis network. Another issue is the challenge of pre-clinical testing of proteostasis-targeted interventions in
a disease that requires robust, yet biochemically amenable, tissue model systems for discovery efforts.
 This R01 proposal seeks to address these knowledge gaps, both identifying and elucidating key mech-
anisms of intracellular folding and quality control, and assessing the therapeutic potential of proteostasis net-
work-targeted interventions in the collagenopathies. In Aim 1, functions of the highly conserved procollagen N-
glycan in promoting folding, enabling quality control, and identifying when folded procollagens are ready for
secretion will be elucidated, via comprehensive work both in cells and in vivo that will reveal the molecular
mechanisms of collagen glycoproteostasis. The expectation is to demonstrate that the long-ignored procolla-
gen N-glycan is actually the critical fulcrum of collagen proteostasis. In Aim 2, a state-of-the-art, 3D cartilage-
in-a-dish model system is deployed to enable robust testing of proteostasis network-targeted therapies for the
collagenopathies. Combined with mechanistic studies to elucidate the biochemistry of dysregulated collagen
proteostasis, work in this Aim will provide a strong foundation for a new, proteostasis-focused perspective on
treating the collagenopathies."

Leigh Syndrome (LS) is an inherited mitochondrial disease that presents with prominent neurologic symptoms
and death in childhood. There are currently no effective therapies for this devastating disease, highlighting an
urgent need to identify novel biological pathways that can be targeted therapeutically to treat LS and other
inherited mitochondrial diseases. Over the past 15 years, an emerging body of research, including recent studies
by us (Brestoff et al., Cell Metabolism, 2021 ), indicates that many cell types export their mitochondria for delivery
to neighboring cells, including neurons, in vivo in a process called interce/lular mitochondria transfer. Our
laboratory also recently reported that administering purified mitochondria to Ndufs4-1- mice with LS completely
restores the cell-intrinsic defects in mitochondrial metabolism of macrophages (Borcherding et al., Cell
Metabolism, 2022). However, it is unknown whether intercellular mitochondria transfer can be harnessed
therapeutically to treat LS. In new preliminary studies, we found that weekly systemic administration of purified
wildtype (WT) mitochondria to Ndufs4-1- mice increased their lifespan and markedly reduced their neurologic
morbidity and neurodegeneration. These data provoke our hypothesis that administering exogenous
mitochondria can rescue the metabolism of recipient cells and may be a previously unknown therapeutic strategy
for LS. Exogenous mitochondria appear to be captured first by macrophages, which are mobile cells that can
later export captured mitochondria to neighboring cells. Based on this finding, we transplanted WT bone marrow
into Ndufs4-1
- hosts and found that this intervention led to delivery of healthy donor cell-derived mitochondria to
host cells, ameliorated LS severity, and extended their lifespan. These data suggest that engrafted immune cells
from bone marrow transplantation can provide a systemically distributed, self-renewing supply of healthy
mitochondria to diseased cells in vivo. Collectively. these data provoke our central hypothesis that providing
sources of healthy mitochondria postnatally may ameliorate LS by rescuing cell-intrinsic metabolic defects. We
will address this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, we will determine how administering exogenous mitochondria
improves the morbidity and mortality of LS. In Aim 2, we will investigate how bone marrow transplantation
improves LS by providing a durable, systemically distributed source of healthy mitochondria. This highly
innovative project will leverage our expertise in intercellular mitochondria transfer and new cutting-edge
technologies to establish the efficacy of and identify the mechanisms of these two novel therapeutic strategies
to treat fatal inherited mitochondrial diseases such as LS."

 The mammalian cell cycle is commonly conceived as a well-understood, hardwired,
invariant pathway. Emerging work, however, indicates that the cell cycle is much more plastic
than generally believed, with multiple adaptive routes through the cell cycle under different
conditions. This plasticity makes the cell cycle robust to environmental perturbations, but also
drives adaptive drug resistance to targeted cell-cycle inhibitors. A fresh look at the dynamics and
pliability of cell-cycle progression will reveal new principles that predict dependence on a
particular cell-cycle node and new strategies to suppress adaptive cell-cycle rewiring.
 Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs) are key enzymes that drive cell proliferation, and
consequently, multiple CDK inhibitors are in development to suppress unwanted cell proliferation.
However, cells eventually find a way around these drugs to resume proliferation. A plausible
hypothesis is that cells leverage cell-cycle plasticity to pursue alternative paths through the cell
cycle. In one striking example, inhibition of CDK2 leads to rapid loss of substrate phosphorylation
as expected, but then CDK2 substrate phosphorylation rebounds within several hours. This
rebound depends on CDK4 and CDK6, which insulate the cell from fluctuations in CDK2 activity
by maintaining Rb hyper-phosphorylation and E2F transcription. This enables CDK2 re-activation
and eventual cell-cycle completion, even in the presence of potent CDK2 inhibitors.
 My lab has pioneered the development of a set of powerful time-lapse microscopy tools
to visualize rapid drug responses in single, living cells. Here, we will apply our technology to
determine the mechanisms driving this unusual rebound in CDK2 activity observed upon CDK2
inhibition. First, we will test the role of the p16 CDK4/6 inhibitor protein on the CDK2 activity
rebound. Second, we will test whether CDK2-dependent degradation of Cyclin D modulates the
CDK2 activity rebound. Third, we will identify additional mechanisms underlying the robustness
of Rb phosphorylation to inhibition of CDK2 and show how long-term drug pressure unleashes
the plasticity of CDKs. Since our findings are likely to be broadly applicable beyond CDK2
inhibitors, our proposed work will fill long-standing gaps in our understanding of how the cell cycle
is wired for success in the face of perturbations."

A cancer diagnosis directly threatens sexual and reproductive health (SRH), an essential component of healthy
development in adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Nearly 60% of AYAs undergoing cancer treatment report
a need for SRH counseling, yet this need is rarely met. This gap in care leaves patients at high risk for making
uninformed decisions that can negatively impact short and long-term SRH. Although national guidelines advise
clinician responsibility for discussing SRH, clinicians rarely engage in these conversations. The proposed study
serves as a first step towards improving SRH outcomes for AYA cancer patients and survivors by developing an
intervention to 1) provide individualized, efficient, patient-centered care and 2) enhance patient-clinician
communication. Dr. Frederick will complete formal didactic coursework, workshops, and career development
programs focused on behavioral intervention science, mixed methods analysis, and clinical trial conduct, that
will prepare her to achieve this goal. She is guided by a robust mentorship team consisting of Primary Mentor,
Dr. Freyer (AYA oncology, quantitative research, clinical trials); Co-Mentor, Dr. Quinn (LGBTQ+ AYA cancer
care, oncofertility, mixed methods research, intervention science); and Co-Mentor, Dr. Bober (SRH in cancer,
qualitative methods, intervention science). This team is supported by a scientific advisory committee with
expertise in implementation science, technology-based communication interventions, and mHealth. In addition,
Dr. Frederick will have access to the abundant and diverse resources of Connecticut Children's and the
University of Connecticut School of Medicine. More specifically, the proposed project will develop, refine, and
assess proof-of-concept (POC) of the Reproductive and Sexual health Patient Education and Communication
Tool (ReSPECT), a novel, patient-centered, web-based intervention that allows AYAs to discreetly communicate
SRH questions and concerns to their oncology clinicians and offers a time-saving strategy for clinicians to assess
patient need and individualize counsel. ReSPECT consists of 3 parts: (1) an AYA-centered pre-visit
questionnaire (PVQ) to alert clinicians to a patient's SRH questions/concerns, (2) targeted patient education
based on PVQ topic selection, and (3) clinician-centered guidance for addressing specific SRH concerns.
Stakeholder interviews with AYAs, survivors, and pediatric oncology clinicians will guide development and
refinement of ReSPECT through qualitative interviews (Aim 1). Next, ReSPECT will undergo POC testing with
30 AYA/clinician pairs in outpatient oncology clinics at Connecticut Children's and Children's Hospital Los
Angeles to assess feasibility, acceptability, usability, and perceived impact on AYA-clinician SRH communication
(Aim 2), and to evaluate preliminary outcomes by comparing pre- and post-intervention survey data (Aim 3). At
study conclusion, ReSPECT will be ready for testing in a randomized controlled trial (planned R01). The
proposed intervention is the first step in developing a systematic program of research that will improve SRH care
for tens of thousands of AYA patients who currently do not have access to the vital resources they need."

Obesity increases the risk of pregnancy complications, including puerperal infections and cesarean delivery,
and risk rises with increasing body mass index (BMI). Since obese women are more likely to have
comorbidities that would necessitate delivery prior to their due date (i.e. prior to 40 weeks gestation), and class
III obesity specifically is an indication for delivery by 39 weeks, these patients have a high rate of labor
induction. In nulliparous women from the general population (obese and non-obese), labor induction at 39
weeks (compared to expectant management) is associated with less maternal morbidity and a lower cesarean
rate. We previously conducted a pilot randomized placebo-controlled trial in obese, nulliparous women
undergoing labor induction at term and found that the cesarean delivery rate was lower in women who received
a prophylactic antibiotic regimen during labor compared with those who received the placebo. Our proposed
multi-center trial aims to test this hypothesis in a large sample with adequate power to determine whether
prophylactic antibiotics during labor are associated with a decrease in the rate of cesarean delivery in term,
nulliparous, obese women. If the findings from the pilot trial are confirmed, this would represent a novel
intervention to decrease the cesarean delivery rate in a subset of women at highest risk for cesarean-related
complications."
10988936,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hyperpolarized (HP) 13C pyruvate MRI is an emerging imaging modality that provides unique access to glucose
metabolism in the brain, a pathway that is implicated in brain aging and neurodegeneration by 15O / 18F metabolic
PET research studies from our group and others. Prior human HP 13C research has been restricted almost
exclusively to scanners from a single vendor, because of need for specialized pulse sequences and hardware.
In this R21 project, we propose to establish the feasibility and reproducibility of advanced HP 13C imaging of the
human brain on a major underexplored clinical MRI platform (Siemens). Although we acknowledge that some
prior HP 13C MR/MRI work has already been conducted on this platform, this will be the first study to use
metabolite-specific echo-planar imaging (EPI) with spectral-spatial radiofrequency (RF) excitation, which is a
highly advantageous approach for HP 13C studies and is the most popular method for human HP 13C MRI,
according to a recent consensus review paper. This will also be the first HP 13C work in brain on Siemens. Thus
we consider feasibility of state-of-the-art human HP 13C brain imaging on this platform as an important objective.
In Aim 1, testing will first be conducted in vitro by imaging a human-scale 3D-printed Shepp-Logan bioreactor
phantom that mimics the signal dynamics of human hyperpolarized 13C brain imaging studies. In Aim 2, we will
evaluate the reproducibility of in vivo HP 13C pyruvate human brain imaging in a test group of cognitively
unimpaired adults, recruited from our existing 15O / 18F metabolic PET study. Each subject will be scanned twice
in succession during each imaging session, and regional and spatial comparisons will be made between runs.
To clarify the overall focus of the project in this resubmission application, the main scientific objective is
evaluating the reproducibility of HP 13C imaging of human brain in normal subjects, which has yet to be
established. As an exploratory aim, topography of this pilot HP 13C pyruvate MRI data will also be compared
against metabolic PET data from the same subjects, to help motivate future HP 13C pyruvate brain imaging
research studies."

The goal of this exploratory work is to elucidate the evolutionary history of symbiotic associations between the
Mucoromycotina fungi and their endosymbiotic bacteria (EB), focusing on population-level processes, including
fungal adaptation to human hosts and contributions of shared 6-methyladenine (6mA) DNA epigenetic
modifications as means of communication between the partners. We expect that this work will establish
foundations for future treatment of mucormycoses, which are human infections caused by Mucoromycotina.
Mucormycoses are increasingly frequent, highly destructive, and often fatal in immune-compromised
individuals. While bacteria-free asymbiotic Mucoromycotina are responsible for many infections, EB are often
detected in clinical isolates and known to affect Mucoromycotina virulence in humans. Therefore, elucidating
population-level processes that govern these Mucoromycotina-EB symbioses is important for developing novel
mucoromycosis therapies. One of the mechanisms contributing to the establishment and maintenance of such
symbioses may be sharing of 6mA DNA modifications by Mucoromycotina and bacteria. Importantly, these
modifications and the contributing enzymes are nearly absent from mammals and potentially could be targeted
by pharmacological inhibitors for mucormycosis therapy.
To test the hypothesis that EB manipulate their fungal hosts through epigenomic reprogramming, we propose
functional characterization of candidate bacterial symbiosis factors, including adenine-specific DNA
methyltransferases. To gain insights into population-level processes shaping fungal-bacterial symbioses, we
plan to conduct a population genomic study of a model fungal-bacterial symbiosis complemented by a
population-level analysis of genome-wide 6mA modification and transcriptional landscapes in fungi differing in
the symbiotic status and source of isolation (natural versus clinical settings).
Expected outcomes of the project include insights into population-level processes, including fungal adaptation
to mammalian hosts and the role of epigenetic reprogramming in the initiation and functioning of fungal-
bacterial symbioses important for human health as well as 6mA methylome data for a leading causal agent of
mucormycosis. The findings are expected to be instrumental in developing future mucormycosis therapies
relying on 6mA DNA modification inhibitors."

Bacteria are surrounded by a cell envelope that is essential for growth, integrity, and pathogenesis. The envelope
and the biogenesis pathways that build it are also the target of many of our most effective antibiotic and vaccine
therapies. Although envelope assembly pathways have been studied for decades and most of the factors
involved have been identified, a gap in our knowledge is how bacteria monitor the envelope for defects and
coordinate their repair. This proposal focuses on the nucleotide second messenger cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP)
and how bacteria modulate its levels in response to envelope defects to facilitate repair. c-di-AMP principally
controls K+ and osmolyte transporters. It is hypothesized that when c-di-AMP levels are reduced turgor pressure
increases; conversely when c-di-AMP levels are increased turgor decreases. Importantly, mutations that alter
the levels of this second messenger are associated with antibiotic resistance. Although much is known about the
intracellular targets of c-di-AMP, the signals that modulate changes in the cellular pool of the cyclic dinucleotide
are largely unknown. The major and most highly conserved c-di-AMP synthase, CdaA, forms a membrane
complex with its hypothesized regulator CdaR. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that Gram-positive
bacteria use CdaR to sense changes in the cell envelope and homeostatically adjust c-di-AMP synthesis. In
preliminary studies, I found that levels of c-di-AMP increase in response to cell wall defects. Separately, I
discovered that CdaR's extracytoplasmic domain is required for cell envelope integrity in the presence of cell
wall defects. In Aim 1, I will investigate the hypothesis that CdaR monitors the cell envelope for defects and
adjusts c-di-AMP levels, and thereby cytoplasmic turgor pressure, in response. The objective of Aim 2 is to
identify specific stimuli sensed by a second more broadly conserved extracytoplasmic domain on CdaR and then
elucidate the molecular mechanism of signal sensation and transduction. This proposal will address important
and outstanding questions related to what stimuli modulate the intracellular cyclic nucleotide pools as well as the
molecular mechanisms by which Gram-positive bacteria monitor and respond to changes in their cell envelope.
My findings will enable the development of drugs which could alter c-di-AMP levels to inhibit growth or re-
sensitize drug-resistant bacteria to frontline antibiotics. These findings are of particular relevance for the
treatment of methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) whose high level of methicillin tolerance has been tied to
high levels of c-di-AMP. In addition, the proposed research and training plan will provide me the skills, knowledge,
and experience to become a successful independent investigator."

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and nonCF bronchiectasis (NCFB) are characterized by thickened respiratory secretions,
chronic lung infection and neutrophilic inflammation. A host of epidemiologic data demonstrates that females
with CF suffer from increased pulmonary exacerbations, earlier colonization with bacteria such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (PsA) and decreased life expectancy relative to males with CF. Similarly, NCFB is more common in
females and associated with worse outcomes in females relative to males, but the etiology behind these sex
disparities is unclear. A leading candidate to explain this disparity is an estrogen-dependent effect on
inflammation and immunity given that our work and the work of others demonstrates higher sputum inflammatory
markers and increased pulmonary exacerbations at times of high estrogen levels (ovulation) in females with CF.
Moreover, we found that suppressing endogenous 17β-estradiol with hormonal contraception improved these
markers of health. Our central hypothesis is that estrogen causes dysregulated neutrophil function and
inflammation leading to a sex difference in lung disease and outcomes in people with CF and NCFB.
CF respiratory disease is characterized by a sustained influx of neutrophils into the lungs in response to bacterial
infection and inflammation. A major mechanism for neutrophil killing is the release of web-like neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs) that trap and kill a variety of microbes. Although NET formation is an important event
in innate immunity, excess NETs can be detrimental by producing pro-inflammatory stimuli and proteases that
amplify lung damage. Our preliminary studies show that: (1) neutrophils from females with CF and NCFB kill less
PsA than neutrophils from males; (2) estrogen decreases neutrophil killing and upregulates NETosis and
inflammatory mediator release.
We aim to answer several key questions including: (1) what estrogen receptor is driving the estrogen effect on
neutrophils (2) what other downstream pathways are involved (3) what is the context of these findings in cis and
transgender individuals (4) Are the findings unique to CF or applicable to other chronic inflammatory airway
diseases such as non-CF bronchiectasis (NCFB). The expected outcome of this research is a comprehensive
understanding of how estrogen mediates functional activity of the neutrophil and the pathways involved that can
reveal therapeutic targets, including the potential use of nebulized estrogen receptor antagonists to combat the
disproportionate chronic inflammatory process present in cis and trans women with CF.
The long-term goal of our lab is to understand the mechanisms leading to sex and gender differences in CF and
to develop novel therapies to narrow the disparity. The objective of this proposal is to understand the estrogen-
specific effect on neutrophil dysregulation and inflammation. The impact of this proposal is significant because it
may lead to treatments that can improve the health of people with CF and NCFB and guide therapies for other
chronic inflammatory airway diseases with similar sex and gender disparities."
11002122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preterm infant brain injury is often associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and altered maturation
of the central nervous system (CNS) progenitor cells required for normal brain development and myelination.
The molecular signals in the injured microenvironment that inhibit CNS progenitor maturation are not fully
known. Thus, no therapeutic options are available to prevent the developmental disabilities associated with
preterm birth. BBB disruption alters the CNS progenitor niche by allowing blood proteins into the CNS.
Fibrinogen, a blood coagulation protein, crosses a leaky BBB and is a key contributor to neuroinflammation,
glial scar formation, neurodegeneration, and inhibition of CNS repair. We hypothesize that fibrinogen is a
critical component of the microenvironment in preterm infant brain injury that inhibits CNS progenitor cell
maturation to impair brain growth and myelination. Our preliminary studies show: (1) neonatal mice subjected
to chronic hypoxia display prominent cerebellar pathology that includes fibrinogen deposition, myelination
deficits, and impaired cerebellar growth; (2) Intraventricular injection of fibrinogen in neonatal mice disrupts
cerebellar development in vivo; (3) Fibrinogen activates the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor activin
A receptor type I (ACVR1) in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to inhibit OPC maturation and
myelination, (4) Fibrinogen inhibits neurogenesis from neuronal progenitor cells in vitro. Our specific aims will
test our working model, whereby fibrinogen deposition after BBB disruption induces ACVR1-mediated BMP
signaling in CNS progenitor cells to inhibit neurogenesis and myelination leading to abnormal
neurodevelopment. In Aim 1, we will define the contribution of fibrinogen to preterm infant brain injury in vivo
using fibrinogen mutant mice. In Aim 2, we will identify the cellular mechanisms that contribute to preterm
infant brain injury at sites of fibrinogen deposition using in vivo two-photon microscopy (2PM). In Aim 3, we will
determine the molecular mechanism of fibrinogen-induced activation of ACVR1 using in vitro binding and
cellular assays. These studies will reveal the molecular link between BBB disruption and failure of CNS
progenitor cell maturation in preterm infant brain injury. My goal is to become an independent physician-
scientist and leader in the field of newborn brain injury. To continue my progress towards this goal, I will build
upon the expertise of the Gladstone Institutes and UCSF to expand my research skills in the following areas:
(1) in vivo 2PM to study the dynamic cellular responses to BBB disruption and fibrinogen deposition in the
neonatal brain, (2) RNA-sequencing and transcriptome analysis to identify fibrinogen-mediated mechanisms of
extrinsic inhibition, and (3) binding assays and inhibitor studies to discover novel fibrinogen receptors on CNS
progenitor cells. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will allow me to compete for R01
funding focused on therapeutics that target the inhibitory microenvironment in preterm infant brain injury."
10983140,"DEVELOPMENT CORE
SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Development Core is to transform the capacity of our Center for climate change and
health in two critical ways: First, the core is responsible for stimulating transdisciplinary, innovative, high impact
research on climate change and health that addresses the needs of vulnerable populations. Second, this core
is responsible for developing a diverse workforce prepared to advance research on climate change and health.
Towards those ends, the Core’s three aims are to: 1) Enact a pilot grant program that provides competitive
support for innovative transdisciplinary climate change and health research; 2) Foster and accelerate the
professional development of early career and junior investigators; and 3) Educate future leaders in climate
change and health. Under Aim 1, this Core will stimulate transdisciplinary research on health outcomes, potential
interventions and health equity pertaining to climate change and health relevant to our central theme through a
funding mechanism for pilot projects (“Urban Resilience Awards”); there will be five awards per year providing
up to $25,000 each year for transdisciplinary research pertinent to our central theme. Three of the awards will
be supported from the P20 grant; an additional two will be supported by the University of Cincinnati under the
same mechanism as a contribution to the development of this Center’s research capacity and productivity. Under
Aim 2, the Development Core will address the pressing public health challenges posed by climate change by
supporting the recruitment, mentoring, research, and training of the next generation of climate scientists. This
aim will involve working closely with the University’s recruitment initiatives for diverse students and faculty. In
addition, the Core will competitively fund one career development grant award per year for an early stage
investigator, and use multiple mechanisms for awards and internships for Graduate and Undergraduate
Scholars. Under Aim 3, this Core will work closely with the Graduate College to develop a Climate Change and
Health Certificate that brings together students from graduate programs as diverse as community planning,
sociology and social work, environmental and public health, epidemiology, medicine, communication, and
architecture and engineering. The educational aims of this Core are being given remarkable financial and
technical support by the UC Graduate College. In summary, this Core supports the overall mission of the Center
and introduces innovation by leveraging novel pilot grant mechanisms that catalyze interdisciplinary research
and collaboration. At the same time, this Core will spearhead several innovative educational initiatives to cultivate
the next generation of climate change leaders. Ultimately, our approach to bridging disciplinary boundaries will
empower a diverse workforce (students, scientists, clinicians, public health professionals, advocates) to effect
meaningful change and foster a resilient, health-conscious society in the face of evolving climatic conditions."
10983142,"Mechanosensitive mechanisms regulating cellular coordination during tissue morphogenesis and
patterning
Parent Grant Abstract:
The long-term goal of this research program is to understand and identify mechanosensitive mechanisms that
regulate cell-to-cell coordination of movements during normal tissue morphogenesis and patterning. Of
particular interest, is the role that mechanosensitive and stretch activated proteins play in the transfer of
electrical currents, ions, and second messengers between cells, as these functions are known to be critical for
coordination of cellular communication within a complex tissue environment. For instance, our sense of touch,
regulation of blood pressure, osmotic regulation, and balance are all regulated by mechanosensitive channels
throughout the body. The importance of mechanosensitive channels is underscored by the association of many
disease states with compromised mechanosensation, including atrial fibrillation, muscular degeneration,
arrhythmias, polycystic kidney disease, and numerous neural diseases. Despite this, a relatively small amount
is known at the level of normal, healthy individual cells about how mechanosensitive channels go from sensing
force to eliciting changes in cellular signaling and/or function. Our interest therefore lies in understanding how
cells assimilate ‘data’ from mechanosensitive channels to alter intra- and inter- cellular communication and
coordinate individual cellular movements within tissues. To carry out this work, we plan to utilize our historic
strengths in zebrafish development and tissue patterning along with sophisticated 3-dimensional in vitro tissue
modeling assays to understand: 1) how mechanosensation affects intracellular signaling, particularly though
the activation of transcriptional networks and altered gene expression, and 2) how mechanosensation affects
intercellular signaling activities to alter patterning of tissues. We will target and utilize highly mechanosensitive
cells, such as astrocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and epidermal cells, for our studies to
understand both generalizable and cell type specific roles of mechanosensation in regulating gene expression,
cellular motility, and cell-to-cell communication. These studies will provide fundamental data and cell biological
knowledge to the community studying mechanosensitive channels."
10983170,"TRANSCEND-Overall
 Overall Summary
Our objective is a Clinical and Translational Research Development Program (CTR-D) that expands clinical and
translational (C&T) research focused on health problems in North Dakota (ND). The name of our CTR-D, TRANSCEND, is
an acronym for Translational Science Engaging North Dakota. TRANSCEND focuses on diseases prevalent in ND and their
potential environmental exposures. The high prevalence of several health conditions in ND, e.g., colorectal cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Diseases, as well as psychiatric problems such as high youth
suicide rates, makes it ideal for investment in research infrastructure, as advances for problems prevalent in ND can be
applied to those problems occurring elsewhere. Partner institutions in TRANSCEND are The University of North Dakota
(UND,) North Dakota State University (NDSU), and Sanford Health. The Specific Aims of Transcend are to:
Aim 1: Elevate the profile of C&T research throughout North Dakota Universities and clinics.
Aim 2. Streamline the “road” to successful C&T research by removing roadblocks and by offering “roadside” assistance
(practical research training and assistance) to investigators.
Aim 3. Make tangible, positive impacts on the health of North Dakotans.
We have identified significant challenges to the conduct of C&T research, including faculty with limited C&T training,
difficult patient access (UNDSMHS does not own a hospital), and challenges for faculty in forming collaborations. We
have developed several strategies to overcome these challenges, including support for Department Chairs and faculty to
enroll in C&T training courses from Mayo Clinic, Harvard, and Stanford University. We have established collaborations
with Sanford and community clinics, e.g., the Community Health Association of the Dakotas (CHAD), to improve access to
patient and patient data. We have developed several collaboration methods, including the TRANSCEND portal with the
names, research interests, and contact information of basic and clinical scientists interested in C&T research, and a
personal research Navigator who can function as a matchmaker to establish teams of researchers.
TRANSCEND will accomplish its aims with 4 scientific cores: Professional Development; Health Research (pilot studies);
Community Engagement; and Research Design. A central Administrative Core supports the cores. Each of the cores is
directed by experienced, extramurally-funded faculty with expertise in investigator training and mentorship. TRANSCEND
innovates in many ways, including a re-entry pilot in which previously unfunded investigators “re-enter” the grant
process, inclusion of Engineering faculty, and financial incentives for submitting extramural grants. Our Community
Engagement and Outreach Core is highly experienced in working with indigenous/minority communities. Another
innovation is our Community Physician at Large (CoPal) who aligns TRANSCEND with community priorities. With its
epidemiologic/public health orientation, TRANSCEND embraces a “trench to bench” and “bench to trench” approach
that broadens the typical “bench to bedside” model. Our vision is that TRANSCEND will transform the academic culture
in ND, train future C&T leaders, and contribute to our long-term goal of improving health in ND."
10983171,"TRANSCEND-Administrative Core
Core Summary
The Administrative (Admin) Core will organize, manage, and provide oversight for all the functions of the TRANSCEND
CTR-D. The Admin Core will be led by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Schwartz, and by a co-lead, Dr. Milavetz, who has
>14 years of experience in research administration. Together, Drs. Schwartz and Milavetz will be responsible for all
aspects of scientific, ethical, and financial compliance for TRANSCEND. The goals of the Admin Core will be accomplished
through four Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Provide leadership and an administrative structure that is responsive to community needs and to our scientific
and clinical partners so that day-to-day operations are coordinated to achieve the overall goals of TRANSCEND.
Aim 2: Foster collaborative engagement between partners and build an internal and external environment conducive
to a well-functioning and integrated CTR.
Aim 3: Create an environment that enhances the productivity of our C&T investigators.
Aim 4: Foster community-driven translational research that positively impacts the health of our region.
The administrative structure will include a Steering Committee of high-level leaders at each participating institution; an
Executive Committee of core leads, co-leads, and others with specific knowledge; and an External Advisory Committee
of national leaders in translational research. The Executive Committee will meet monthly and will serve as a bidirectional
conduit for reviewing progress, addressing potential issues, and evaluating the effectiveness of core programming. The
Admin Core will coordinate with the other cores in TRANSCEND to ensure that their respective proposals are consistent
with the aims of the CTR-D. The Admin Core will also be responsible for collecting scientific and financial data to
measure the success of TRANSCEND and working with Cores on needed changes to improve the function of the core.
The Admin Core is designed to integrate the health issues of interest to North Dakota communities with the present and
potential research expertise in TRANSCEND. Numerous health problems, e.g., colorectal cancer, neurodegenerative
diseases, suicide, and high radon levels, have high prevalence rates in ND. Thus, developing the expertise and the
workforce to address these issues is essential. In conjunction with other cores in TRANSCEND, the Admin Core has
developed numerous innovative approaches to increase the skilled workforce to address these issues. These include
educational opportunities for faculty to obtain Continuing Medical Education Credits for courses in C&T research,
methods to incentivize grant submission and resubmissions, and the use of a Community Physician at Large (CoPAL) who
serves as a liaison between TRANSCEND and the needs of rural hospitals."
10996356,"Abstract: Over a century ago, Felix d’ Herelle began using bacterial viruses which he termed “bacteriophages”
to treat bacterial infections. Such “phage therapy” has gained new interest due to the emergence of multi-drug
resistant bacterial pathogens. An advantage of phage therapy is the ability to lyse specific bacteria without
disrupting the host microbiota. Although phages can infect and lyse bacteria, bacteria have evolved a myriad of
molecular defense systems to protect against phage infection. This has led to the search and identification of a
plethora of novel phage defense mechanisms; however, there are still a vast number of phage defense
systems that have yet to be discovered and the molecular mechanism by which these systems mediate phage
defense is often not well understood. My research centers on the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae as it is
intimately linked to phage predation both during environmental persistence and human infection. Moreover, V.
cholerae has been a catalyst in the discovery of multiple novel phage defense systems. Due to its intricate
relationship with phage, the central hypothesis of my thesis research is that V. cholerae encodes additional
novel phage defense systems. To identify these systems, I screened a V. cholerae cosmid genomic library in
Escherichia coli for segments of V. cholerae’s genome that protected E. coli from infection by T2 phage. I
identified one cosmid encoding 25 kB of DNA that provided E. coli protection against T2, T4, T5, and secΦ18
infection. Transposon and deletion mutagenesis on this cosmid revealed two distinct phage defense systems.
The first novel defense system involves two genes VC1767 and VC1766. Both genes are closely related to
Type IV Modification Dependent systems which are known to defend against phage infection by targeting
special modifications on the phage DNA. To uncover the mechanism of VC1767-66, I propose: 1) evolutionary
passage to determine whether phage DNA is being modified or if escape mutants arise, 2) purification of
VC1767 and VC1766 to determine their biochemical activity, and 3) quantification of phage genome replication
during infection to determine when protection occurs. The second novel defense involves three genes VC1764,
VC1763 and VC1762, which belong to a newly discovered but uncharacterized Zorya system. These genes
are hypothesized to be an abortive infection system that kills phage infected cells to protect the surrounding
population. To understand this system, I propose: 1) determine whether these three genes are sufficient to
protect against phage infection, 2) evaluate proton motive force disassociation to determine if this drives
defense, and 3) determine if this system exhibits abortive infection. Both systems will be further examined in V.
cholerae using mutagenesis and infection with V. cholerae phage. My studies will uncover the molecular
mechanisms by which these systems protect bacteria from phage infection, increasing our understanding of
the evolution and ecology of V. cholerae while highlighting important mechanisms by which bacteria can resist
phage therapy."
10996421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In most chronic pain syndromes there is a 1.5-2 times higher incidence in females compared to males after
puberty, which may in part be due to differences in sex hormone levels and receptors and/or other unknown
mechanisms related to sex and/or gender. Gender-affirming hormone therapy (GHT) is routinely used in
gender minority (GM) persons' gender-affirming medical care. Masculinizing GHT includes the use of
testosterone, whereas feminizing GHT includes estrogen and progesterone, often in conjunction with an anti-
androgen. In 2011, The Institute of Medicine identified GM adults as an understudied population in critical need
of more health-related research. The GM community includes those who identify as transgender men (TGM),
transgender women (TGW), and as non-binary (persons whose gender is not binary). There are only a few
studies on how GHT is related to the presence and severity of pain in GM persons. Previous research has
shown that GM persons have been reported to have an overall greater prevalence of multiple chronic pain
syndromes compared to cisgender persons (persons whose gender corresponds to their sex assigned at birth).
Retrospective and cross-sectional studies have identified that GHT may affect the presence and severity of
chronic pain in the GM population, with masculinizing GHT being potentially associated with improvements in
chronic pain and feminizing GHT with estrogen/progesterone and anti-androgens potentially worsening chronic
pain. We hypothesize that the presence of androgenic hormonal influences is protective against the
development of a specific chronic pain mechanism, nociplastic pain – pain that appears to be driven by the
central nervous system (CNS). The mechanisms that underlie nociplastic pain are not entirely understood, but
it is thought that amplified and/or dysregulated pain and sensory signaling within the CNS plays a substantial
role. Numerous chronic pain syndromes have been identified as primarily nociplastic and include fibromyalgia,
tension headache, and chronic low back pain. These and other pain syndromes often co-occur and are
recognized by the NIH as Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs). A large knowledge gap exists and
thus presents a unique opportunity to study how GHT may influence the presence and severity of pain in GM
persons using a rigorous longitudinal design. Aim 1: To characterize the trajectory of pain and pain-related
symptoms in GM adults taking GHT. Aim 2: To perform quantitative sensory testing (QST) and functional brain
neuroimaging of GM adults undergoing GHT to examine the mechanism(s) that underlie changes in pain and
sensory sensitivity associated with GHT. Aim 3: To perform qualitative studies of how GHT affects gender
affirmation, psychological wellbeing, and the experience of pain. We will perform and communicate results of
these studies using a community-engaged approach. Data from our work will better enable clinicians to inform
GM patients about potential pain-related changes that may occur with GHT and support future studies on
mechanisms-based interventions to treat and mitigate chronic pain during gender-affirming care."

Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is the etiological agent of several hematopoietic malignancies including multiple types
of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). These EBV-positive NHL subtypes are comprised of post-transplant
lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL), T cell lymphomas, Natural killer
(NK)/T cell lymphoma (NKTL), and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Our studies have found that FAM72A is highly
expressed in EBV-positive lymphomas and contributes to EBV-mediated lymphomagenesis, which gives rise to
EBV-positive NHL. In response to PAR-21-348, we propose to address how EBV’s upregulation of FAM72A
contributes to the development of EBV-driven NHL."
11001750,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The delta cell is uniquely positioned in the islet to integrate local signals and circulating nutrient cues to regulate
alpha and beta cell function. Delta cells exert inhibitory effects on alpha and beta cells through somatostatin
secretion. Paracrine actions of SST form a negative feedback loop to restrain hormone secretion and maintain
glucose homeostasis. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), delta cell responses to ambient glucose are disproportionate
and consequently alter insulin and glucagon secretion leading to dysglycemia. However, we know relatively little
about the mechanisms influencing delta cells in health and disease. Thus, understanding factors that regulate
delta cell SST secretion may reveal pathogenic mechanisms contributing to diabetes and direct new therapies
to achieve glucose homeostasis. Leptin is a circulating hormone that reduces alpha and beta cell function, but
the specific islet cell target and mechanism of action are unclear. While leptin potently inhibits insulin and
glucagon secretion, contemporary experiments suggest leptin effects on alpha and beta cells occurs through
indirect mechanisms. Of note, the leptin receptor (LepR) is exclusively expressed on delta cells of human islets.
Our preliminary data demonstrate leptin stimulates SST secretion from human and mouse islets, corresponding
with decreased insulin and glucagon secretion. Our initial studies also show leptin-induced SST requires delta
cell LepR expression, and given SST inhibits alpha and beta cell function, suggests an indirect mechanism
whereby leptin regulates alpha and beta cells via SST. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that leptin stimulates
delta cell SST secretion to inhibit alpha and beta cell function. Our project goal is to define the mechanism(s) by
which leptin regulates delta cell secretion of SST. In Aim 1, we will temporally reduce circulating leptin levels to
define the acute impact of leptin on islet function and morphology independent of overt hyperglycemia. Aim 2
will use genetic tools and SST receptor antagonists to establish the leptin specific effects on delta cells and how
leptin exerts paracrine effects in islets. Lastly, Aim 3 will employ pharmacologic and genetic interventions with
live functional imaging and unbiased approaches to reveal the molecular and transcriptional mechanisms of
leptin action in delta cells. These studies are the first to describe leptin effects on pancreatic delta cells and SST
secretion. Our project offers a significant advancement in islet biology given how little we know about delta cells.
We will define the mechanisms of leptin regulation of delta cells and uncover a unifying mechanism whereby
leptin acts indirectly on alpha and beta cells through paracrine SST signaling. Importantly, delta cells play a
critical role to maintain balance of insulin and glucagon secretion. As such, our findings are expected to have
high impact on the field and will reveal new signaling mechanisms governing islet function that potentially exert
therapeutic benefits for diabetes."
11001785,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Patients with persistent post-concussion vestibular dysfunction (PCVD) demonstrate visual motion sensitivity
characterized by visual and motion stimuli inducing vestibular symptoms. We hypothesize that patients may
acutely benefit from altered weighting of multisensory, particularly visual, input into vestibular processing
networks to compensate for central or peripheral vestibular impairment, although this may persist and become
maladaptive, leading to persistent vestibular symptoms. However, the changes in multisensory processing that
underlie PCVD are largely theoretical and represent a significant knowledge gap in our understanding.
 In a recent pilot study, we found selective increased activation in the primary vestibular cortex and vestibular
multisensory processing regions in patients with subacute PCVD during a novel task-based fMRI visual-
vestibular paradigm as well as altered resting-state fMRI connectivity between visual and vestibular processing
centers, which correlates with symptom severity. Our central hypothesis is that persistent PCVD is due to altered
multisensory vestibular processing, with increased activation/connectivity of visual and oculomotor inputs into
the vestibular network.
 Prior efforts to classify concussion based upon clinical symptoms have been limited as pre-existing
symptoms may mimic post-concussion symptoms. We hypothesize that defining endophenotypes for PCVD
patients using a combination of clinical and neuroimaging metrics will better subdivide this population and will
correlate with response to vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT).
 To assess these hypotheses, we propose the following three Specific Aims: (1) define regional brain
activation that distinguishes PCVD patients from concussion recovered and control groups using a novel visual-
vestibular task-based fMRI paradigm and correlations with subjective and objective vestibular testing; (2) identify
alterations in functional networks and dynamic states in the PCVD group compared to recovered and control
groups at rest and correlations with subjective and objective vestibular testing; and (3) stratify PCVD subjects
into endophenotypes using clinical and neuroimaging metrics and determine the predictive power of these
endophenotypes to predict VRT response. We propose a longitudinal study with three groups: (1) subacute
PCVD patients, (2) patients with prior symptomatic concussion but who have since recovered, and (3) healthy
controls. All subjects will undergo comprehensive vestibular testing and brain MRI. PCVD subjects will repeat
clinical testing after completion of VRT. We expect to confirm and expand our preliminary data findings as well
as develop endophenotypes that will be predictive model of VRT response. The proposed study will fill in current
gaps in knowledge, drive the development of novel therapies, identify neuroimaging/clinical patterns that predict
therapy response, and lead to the development of tailored, patient-centric therapy programs."

HIV-related stigma and discrimination operate at multiple socioecological levels and are known obstacles to
optimal health and HIV outcomes. In Zambia, some boarding school environments can be characterized by a
culture of physical, verbal, and sexual abuse strongly linked to stigma and discrimination. Despite this, little
data exists on the impact of HIV-related stigma or stigma reduction interventions within school settings, with
even less attention to boarding schools. This study responds to the challenges of making Zambian boarding
schools safe, stigma-free havens with reduced risk behaviors and improved health outcomes for learners,
teachers, and support staff – both those living with HIV and those who are not. Building on evidence that
addressing HIV stigma and discrimination can disrupt the cycle of violence that is both cause and
consequence of HIV risk and vulnerability, this study’s objective is to pilot test and evaluate a ‘total school
approach’ to addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination in boarding schools, embedded in a
safeguarding framework. We will co-create stigma reduction intervention packages with learners, teachers,
staff, people living with HIV and other key stakeholders at two boarding schools in Zambia. Learners, teachers,
and staff will be trained to then deliver trainings to at least 80% of each school’s population. For Aim 1, we will
conduct a formative phase to adapt a ‘total facility approach’ for addressing stigma and discrimination in
healthcare to the Zambian boarding school setting, and to co-create an intervention package, that uses a
safeguarding approach, with the participating school communities. For Aim 2, we will carry out a paired pre-
post study to pilot test the impact of the intervention on stigma and discrimination and broader safeguarding
measures. We will implement a pre-post study design with outcomes measured through repeat paired surveys
before and after the intervention. For Aim 3, a mixed-methods process evaluation will explore how the school
environment affects its population’s attitudes and behaviors and seek to understand implementation barriers
and facilitators with a view to informing sustainability and scale-up. The primary outcome measures will be self-
reported experience of abuse and stigmatizing attitudes relating to HIV. Mixed-methods approaches will
provide insight into why different elements of the intervention worked/did not work and maximize learning about
implementation of this approach to fostering a safe school environment, free from stigma and discrimination so
as to improve HIV-related outcomes."

SUMMARY
The barriers to research and career success for underrepresented groups in academic medicine have been
widely documented—an inhospitable climate, discriminatory policies, lower financial compensation, lack of
leadership opportunities, a sense of marginalization, and racism, among others. Strategies to eliminate these
barriers have been largely unsuccessful as evidenced by the persistent “representation gap.” Research suggests
that while strategies focused on individuals are useful, an integrated approach will be necessary to effect
systemic change. Efforts toward inclusive excellence are underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai (ISMMS) with such transformative initiatives as the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) Task Force to
Address Racism; a novel recruitment program to attract junior and senior Black/AA and Latinx faculty (The
Biomedical Laureates Program); creation of the Office for Gender Equity; establishment of the Institute for Health
Equity Research; and launch of The Center for Scientific Diversity. The purpose of the proposed FIRST Cohort
program is to accelerate inclusive excellence at our institution and, by extension, contribute to accelerating
inclusive excellence more broadly in the national biomedical research enterprise. Building on current initiatives,
our goals are to (1) foster sustainable culture/climate change; (2) promote inclusive excellence by hiring a diverse
cohort of new early-career faculty; and (3) support faculty development, mentoring, sponsorship, and promotion.
Our primary outcome is for FIRST Cohort faculty hires to secure an NIH R-award by the conclusion of the grant
period. We will pursue three related aims. First, we will modify the MSHS Task Force To Address Racism
Roadmap for Change with key strategies as the basis for an ISMMS Roadmap for Inclusive Excellence to include
(1) development of a process to collect accurate, comprehensive demographic faculty data and to make this
data accessible; (2) engagement of the faculty in regular climate surveys and the sharing of results with faculty
and institutional leaders; (3) departmental/Institute level review of advancement & promotion practices, policies,
and processes; among other key strategies. Second, we will recruit a diverse Cohort comprised of 4 clusters of
3 faculty per cluster to be embedded within our interdisciplinary Institutes. We will develop a new recruitment
protocol to ensure fairness and equity in the hiring process, require bias reduction training for search committee
members, and establish standardized interview processes. Next, we will provide an integrated program of faculty
development to include both career advancement and professional development activities (e.g., individual
development plans, mentor/sponsor committees, Grants-in-Progress workshops, individual coaching around
such issues as work-life integration, peer mentoring, etc.) Cluster Sponsors will lead the way in identifying
opportunities for formal and informal networking across the ISMMS and in the larger scientific community. With
the support of an institutional investment, all FIRST Cohort faculty will be retained at the conclusion of the award
period. We will conduct a rigorous evaluation of the program and collaborate closely with NIH CEC as required.

Zoonoses account for at least 75% of emerging human diseases globally. Indonesia has
been identified as one of the major emerging pathogen “hotspots” and the
opportunities for an emergence event to become epidemic in the absence of a reliable
detection system across Indonesia are high. Through Detection and Characterization of
Emerging Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Pathogens in Indonesia project, we will recognize
and identify these events and to rapidly detect the transmission of pathogens with
pandemic potential to human populations in Indonesia. In our existing CK15-001, we
have established capacity at the Eijkman Institute for recognition and identification of
emerging pathogens and piloted the use of these technologies to detect the transmission
to human populations in Indonesia.
The work in this follow up proposal will lay the foundation for a network of trained
laboratory personnel, provide baseline information on the vector-borne agents likely to
emerge and cause human disease in the fourth most populated country in the world,
and rapidly characterize any vector-borne pathogen of human concern circulating in the
country. Completion of these aims will not only provide direct public health benefits to
Indonesia, but will aid in advancing the Global Health Security Agenda (GSHA)
objectives of understanding the risk to US populations by assessing emergence events
globally."
11003796,"PROJECT SUMMARY
By 2025, an estimated 1.6 billion people around the world will be hypertensive. This estimate may be higher
given recently modified guidelines for hypertension that are inclusive of millions of additional patients. What is
concerning is that almost 20% of all hypertensive patients are resistant to current therapies. Better understanding
of the underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension is required in order to identify new
and effective therapeutic strategies.
Chronic renal inflammation is suspected to be a causal mechanism of resistant hypertension. The objective of
this grant proposal is to examine the the control of renal inflammation using a model of chronic inflammatory
disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory in which renal inflammation
precedes the development of hypertension in SLE; therefore, it is an appropriate disease model to use to
elucidate mechanisms involved in the inflammatory origins of hypertension.
Endogenous neuro-immunoregulatory systems like the novel cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway are involved
in the normal control of excessive inflammation. Our data indicate that boosting this vagus nerve-to-spleen
pathway via systemic pharmacological approaches reduces renal inflammation and blood pressure in an
experimental mouse model of SLE. Based on this, we hypothesize that active neuroimmune pathways protect
the kidney by suppressing renal inflammation and preventing the subsequent development of
hypertension. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will determine if central stimulation of the vagus nerve via both
chemogenetic and pharmacological techniques reduces renal inflammation through the cholinergic anti-
inflammatory pathway, and is antihypertensive in SLE. Studies in this aim will elucidate central nuclei involved
in the regulation of renal inflammation that if left unchecked can result in hypertension in SLE. In Aim 2, we will
determine whether inhibiting the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway by blocking its nodes of
neurotransmission exacerbates SLE hypertension. Studies in this aim will determine critical neural/peripheral
components necessary for proper neuroimmune regulation. In Aim 3, we will determine if an intrinsic renal anti-
inflammatory pathway works in parallel with the spleen-centric cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Studies in
this aim will examine the anti-inflammatory potential of local acetylcholine in renal immune cells in hypertension-
prone SLE mice using in vitro studies and innovative sniffer cell technoogy. Overall, the proposed studies will
explain how homeostatic neuroimmune mechanisms control renal inflammation in health, as well as offer
therapeutic options for controlling renal inflammation in hypertension and other chronic inflammatory diseases."

 The 2024 FASEB NAD Metabolism and Signaling Meeting serves to unite researchers and clinicians
who share the desire to elucidate NAD-dependent mechanisms and to evaluate the potential for NAD-based
approaches for improving human health. This meeting overcomes barriers that inevitably form around sub-
disciplines and promotes new collaborations. The meeting attracts attendees who work in different fields and
retains a clear focus and interactive climate. This promotes genuine discourse, sincere collaboration, sharing
of unpublished data, and exchange of burgeoning ideas. In turn, this meeting has accelerated the pace of
discovery, expansion of NAD research into new areas, and resulted in forward progress of the field. In 2024 we
seek to accommodate this growing and dynamic field, to push for technical breakthroughs, to obtain clarity in
measurement standards and evaluation criteria for human trials, and to welcome investigators from new areas
of research into our community. We are hosting new topic-specific sessions for cancer and neurobiology, and
will pilot a pre-meeting event for trainees called Precursors. We are also hosting a dedicated speaker session
for clinical trials, as well as a professionally moderated panel with the objective to develop discourse and
consensus around how to approach studies of NAD in human health.
 The breadth of this meeting encompasses a vast diversity of biological topics and diseases, as well as
includes the entire NAD metabolome such as NAD+, NADH, NADP+, NADPH, NaADP, ADP-Ribose, cyclic
ADPR, Methylated-Nam, and pyridone nucleotides. The meeting further hosts researchers who use
approaches that scale from atomic structural analyses to human physiology. Represented fields include
chemistry, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, preclinical organismal models, synthetic biology,
engineering, and human trials. Thus, the major benefits of this meeting are the integration of ideas and
collaborative outcomes across disciplines, as well as clarity and leadership for standards in NAD research."

Dedicated breast CT is an emerging technology with approximately 20-25 clinical prototypes and clinical systems
worldwide. It does not require physical compression of the breast, can eliminate breast tissue superposition, and
provides 3D images at near-isotropic spatial resolution. Earlier generations of breast CT, while demonstrating
the concept, were suboptimal due to technological limitations and available components. In the prior funding
(R01 CA199044), we focused on the hardware aspects: tested 4 detectors from different vendors, followed by
designing, developing, and testing a dedicated breast CT system that employed an offset-detector geometry to
enable imaging large breasts. This system achieved high resolution and low system noise and was specifically
designed to improve chest-wall coverage and operate at a radiation dose suitable for breast cancer screening.
In the pilot study completed under prior funding (R01 CA199044), the system demonstrated visualization of the
pectoralis muscle in 177/179 (98.9%) breasts (effective diameter at chest wall: 12.82.1 cm); a remarkable
improvement over the 40-78% reported in prior studies, and the mean glandular dose (MGD) was 4.10.9 mGy,
which is similar to that reported for digital mammography (4.15 mGy) in the Digital Mammography Imaging
Screening Trial (DMIST) study. In this competitive renewal, we focus on image reconstruction followed by a
multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study using prospectively acquired
data to evaluate if dedicated breast CT demonstrates improved performance over the current standard, digital
breast tomosynthesis (DBT) for breast cancer screening. For image reconstruction, we will investigate a total of
5 techniques that were carefully chosen to encompass the current and emerging methods including the standard
Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) reconstruction, one compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction that is
well-founded on a rigorous mathematical framework, and three deep learning-based reconstruction techniques
with increasing sophistication, generalizability, and scientific rigor. The deep learning-based methods include a
fully-supervised technique that requires input-reference image pairs and is tuned using physics-based measure,
a self-supervised technique that does not require an independent reference image, and a self-supervised
technique that is based on both the imaging physics and the mathematics of image reconstruction and does not
require independent training data. These methods are not only applicable to dedicated breast CT, but are
adaptable to cone-beam CT, in general, and potentially to the commonly used multi-detector CT. The MRMC
ROC study is based on well-founded image science and is designed with statistical rigor. To our knowledge,
there have been no prior studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of DBT and breast CT at radiation dose
levels suitable for breast cancer screening. This research addresses this unmet need. This research will not only
provide pivotal data on the imaging performance of breast CT but also advance the state of image reconstruction
that is applicable to the broader field."
10998187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In our daily lives, we frequently encounter ambiguous information. Navigating this ambiguity—generating
interpretations, adapting them in response to new information, and encoding them in memory—plays a pivotal
role in shaping our thoughts and behaviors. Biases in interpretation and memory are both risk factors and
symptoms for major depressive and anxiety disorders, with clinical strategies like cognitive reappraisal—
deliberate, targeted changes in how someone interprets a situation—aiming to mitigate these biases. However,
past work has either focused on isolated parts of this process (e.g., how someone forms an interpretation without
examining their likelihood of shifting it) or used simple perceptual stimuli (e.g., visual illusions) where individuals
alternate between a small number of definitive percepts. Real-world scenarios, particularly social ones, are
inherently more subjective and thus, are more likely to reveal biases associated with conditions like depression
or anxiety. Despite their importance, social scenarios have received limited attention in this research context,
possibly because of the difficulty in balancing experimental control with ecological realism. This proposal aims
to address these gaps by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a novel behavioral task
paradigm that mimics real-life social ambiguities. Leveraging advancements in natural language processing
(NLP), my task involves presenting participants with ambiguous social scenarios, collecting their subjective
interpretations, and then exposing them to alternative views from other participants. NLP enables the objective
comparison of a virtually unlimited number of interpretations in order to generate alternatives in real time that
are tailored to how the participant just interpreted an image. Past work has demonstrated that multivariate neural
patterns reflect differences in percepts and interpretations across subjects as well as changes in percepts within
subjects, even when sensory input is held constant. My study will investigate where and how shifts in neural
patterns to the same sensory information (namely, ambiguous social photographs) predict changes in
interpretations (Aim 1) and the encoding of these interpretations into memory (Aim 2). I anticipate that I will find
distinct, yet complementary, neural substrates supporting these behaviors. Ultimately, this research will yield a
mechanistic model explaining where, how, and why the same sensory information can lead to different subjective
interpretations and how these interpretations are encoded into memory. This model will contribute to our
fundamental understanding of these cognitive processes and will also generate testable hypotheses for
therapeutic interventions aimed at normalizing interpretational and memory biases related to subjective
information."

Exposure to traumatic events can result in intrusive fear memories that can be evoked not only by stimuli that
were present during the event, but also by stimuli that have gained the ability to activate fear through higher-
order process despite never being directly paired with trauma. Such fear memories are adaptive but can also
contribute to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with patients often experiencing
flashbacks and/or reoccurring memories related to the traumatic event. While a large body of research has
focused on identifying the neural substrates responsible for fear memories retrieved by stimuli that were present
and directly associated with trauma, much less is known about encoding and retrieval of higher-order
conditioning, which allows stimuli not present at the time of trauma to evoke fear responses. It is therefore
important to understand the neural substrates that support the encoding and retrieval of higher-order fear
memories. Without this knowledge, determining the precise relationship between intrusive memories and PTSD
is unlikely. To address this, the proposed research will use chemogenetic and in vivo electrophysiological
recording methods in freely moving rats to investigate the necessity of network signal properties underlying the
encoding and retrieval of higher-order conditioning, and their coordination across cortical regions. This
contribution is expected to be significant because it will yield a detailed understanding of the neural
substrates of adaptive higher-order fear memories, which may inform the link between intrusive
maladaptive memories and PTSD. Such findings also have the potential to inform treatments for PTSD,
especially trauma-focused therapies, in which patients specifically focus on the memory of the trauma or
other trauma reminders."
10980353,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Here we propose a novel technological platform that enables rapid and unbiased analysis of entire organs at
subcellular resolution. An example of application is to study the developmental glial production (gliogenesis) in
the mouse forebrain. Glial cells (also called glia), the most abundant cells in the central nervous system (CNS),
play key roles in formation and modulation of myelin, synaptic transmission, and more. Many developmental and
adult cases of CNS injury and degeneration such as Alexander disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s
disease are also associated with alterations in the development of glia. Unlike neurogenesis, gliogenesis remains
active and responsive throughout adulthood, making gliogenesis a suitable candidate for future regenerative
studies. Therefore, unfolding the mechanisms in which gliogenesis is regulated can provide a way to control the
fate of glial cells and, consequently, the ability to reverse neurodegenerative diseases.
However, the study of gliogenesis during development and adulthood is technically challenging. Since we use
mouse genetic approaches to study gliogenesis mechanistically, our studies necessitate unbiased analyses that
require tissue processing, imaging, collection and storage of large datasets, quantification, and regional
annotations of the entire forebrain across space and time. This is practically impossible to achieve using classical
histology and manual or even semi-automated methods that can take several years per gene. We have
established a pipeline for light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of tissue cleared (TC) mouse forebrains.
The pipeline automatically locates and classifies millions of cells by color and morphology in thousands of images
and maps them after registration to established global coordinate system such as the widely utilized Allen Brain
Atlas. Combing further software development and hardware innovation, the level of imaging and unbiased
analytical system is unprecedented and has the potential to be game-changing, allowing full and detailed cellular
and subcellular analyses that have heretofore been unattainable.
Specifically, we will: 1) Optimize a pipeline that implements simultaneous and automated detection and
classification of multiple cell types in TC brains with LSFM imaging. To accelerate the adoption of such a pipeline
in a biology lab, a graphical user interface will streamline the user’s ability to verify the results and to correct for
errors using active learning. 2) Deploy a Deep Design (DD) approach for enhancing optical sectioning and multi-
color acquisition in LSFM. The success of the DD initiative holds the potential to unlock various applications
aimed at enhancing hardware reliant on deep learning for data analysis.
Success of these goals will lead to an automated imaging and analysis platform that is developed to address
questions in an important biological problem."
10979318,"We propose an Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) Diagnostic Center of Excellence (DCoE) at the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS). The MSHS, a large health system in New York City, serves highly diverse populations. Our investigators are leaders in community-engaged genomic research with equitably diverse enrollment. Mount Sinai's DCoE will build upon our Undiagnosed Disease Program (UDP), modeled on the UDN approach, that has a strong track record of applying state-of-the-art genomic approaches, including using artificial intelligence (AI)-based variant prioritization and long-read genome sequencing. We routinely pursue functional genomic studies for high- quality candidate variants, through our Drosophila-based modeling core and collaboratively. Adapting to and complying with the UDN standardized approach will be our deep commitment. We will be active contributors to UDN governance. For Aim 1, we will incorporate Mount Sinai's UDP as a DCoE within the collaborative UDN ecosystem. Enrolled Tier 2-4 pediatric and adult patients (35–50/year) with rare, undiagnosed disorders will be assessed in the ISMMS Clinical Research Unit by a team of physicians with broad expertise in Genetics, Pediatrics, Medicine, and Neurology, among others. Our DCoE central group includes the persons who have driven the success of our existing UDP, which routinely screens referrals and analyzes exome, genome, and RNAseq data for unsolved cases. To enhance diverse UDP referrals from the NYC area, we will expand our existing outreach to the > 7,000 physicians in the MSHS as well as those with our community partner, the Institute for Family Health, and draw from unsolved cases within our clinical genetics services. We will seek to advance sustainability through a multi-prong approach including establishing clinical utility and conversations with payers, and by continued philanthropic donor engagement. For Aim 2, we will deploy the clinical and research benefits of our UDN DCoE equitably for New York City's highly diverse population. We will leverage the fact that the MSHS resides in one of the most ancestrally diverse places on earth, providing the potential for equitable inclusion. We will rely on our site's expertise with community-engaged participatory research, specifically for genomic medicine, in order to fashion strategies to make UDN participation accessible and attractive. The Mount Sinai DCoE will apply this proven approach to improve the diversity of UDN referrals. For Aim 3, we will undertake in-depth, research-based characterization of UDN patients with immunological disorders. We will perform extensive immune profiling of participants prioritized as more likely to have single- gene disorders of the immune system in order to drive understanding of trait pathogenesis. For adult patients likely to have traits with somatic gene variants, we will undertake deep sequencing to detect mosaicism. In summary, we are proposing a Mount Sinai DCoE that will draw upon a diverse urban population, experience with our own UDP, and expertise in community-engaged research to contribute to the UDNs Phase III goals."
10979381,"Pulmonary infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) account for a staggering amount of morbidity and
mortality worldwide. A highly effective vaccine able to prevent (i) active disease, (ii) relapse after chemotherapy,
and (iii) reinfection, remains elusive even in the face of concerted global efforts. One obstacle hindering the
comparison of vaccine candidates and their progression in the pipeline is a lack of consensus in the field on
important immunological endpoints to include in preclinical studies and clinical trials. The research proposed
here aims to leverage core models with a suboptimal drug treatment regimen to resolve differences in relapse
rates with or without concurrent vaccine candidate immunizations. Relapse and reinfection are clearly defined
outcomes for TB patients, and we aim to develop not only an effective therapeutic vaccine but also better
screening methods for understanding efficacy endpoints in preclinical models. To achieve these goals, we will
screen sixteen vaccine candidates consisting of four subunit antigens (including clinically proven M72 and ID93
antigens, a promising therapeutic candidate ID91, and a novel TB subunit (TBSU) candidate) formulated with
four adjuvant candidates that differ in their modes of action, which will be screened using innovative therapeutic
animal models (in mice and guinea pigs). M72 with an AS01E-like adjuvant, co-developed by our team, will be
included as a comparator in these studies, which will add scientific rigor as this is the first defined vaccine to
show protection in previously M.tb infected individuals.
We hypothesize that combined with a drug treatment regimen, an optimized therapeutic vaccine
candidate protein + adjuvant can reduce relapse and reinfection by eliciting a multifaceted antigen-
specific immune response. In Aim 1 16 vaccine candidates will be assessed using safety and efficacy
endpoints both in vitro and in vivo. We will also choose an antigen dose that is effective and safe for use in Aim
2. Aim 2 will be devoted to evaluating the full complement of 16 candidates (4 antigens x 4 adjuvants) for
therapeutic protection from relapse in the mouse model. Following a mouse relapse screen, vaccine candidates
will be further downselected. Finally, 2 lead vaccine combinations that show efficacy (survival, relapse, and
protection from drug-resistant M.tb) in both sexes will be advanced into the guinea pig therapy model where they
will be assessed for durable treatment success as measured by a reduction in bacterial counts (in the lung and
spleen), reduction in lung pathology, prevention of disease RNA signatures, clinical scoring (including weights),
and enhanced survival over drug treatment alone, to select the final candidate for advancement to Aim 3. In Aim
3, we will examine the lead candidate for therapeutic efficacy of protection from reinfection following primary TB
infection. We will also investigate the mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy by systematically interrogating immune
correlates of protection by examining detailed genetic mechanisms using a series of collaborative cross
genotypes."
10981418,"Effects of Changes in Labor and Delivery Nursing Organizational Characteristics on Obstetric
 Outcomes and Disparities
The rising rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States demand answers. Childbirth is the
most common reason for hospital care, comprising 1 in 9 hospitalizations. Maternal morbidities, including
postpartum hemorrhage and peripartum infection, are principal determinants of maternal mortality. Cesarean
delivery in low-risk women is associated with significantly higher maternal and infant morbidity. These three
outcomes vary widely across hospitals and are marked by stark disparities between Black and non-Black
women. There is a compelling need to examine factors in the health care system that account for these
variations and disparities. Labor and delivery registered nurses are frontline care providers responsible for
monitoring and early recognition of and intervention for the prevention of these outcomes. They provide
continuous bedside care that is critical to achieving optimal birth outcomes. Evaluating the influence of nursing
on obstetric outcomes, however, has been largely ignored. In other hospital populations, patient outcome
variation has been linked to variation in nursing organizational characteristics, such as the nurse work
environment, nurse workload, and the percentage of Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree-prepared
registered nurses. The clear clinical basis for nursing organizational characteristics to influence
obstetric outcomes and disparities creates a critical need to investigate these relationships to inform
professional guidelines and nursing unit organization to transform practice. We propose a novel,
geographically representative, multi-hospital cross-sectional and longitudinal study. We will determine whether
cross-sectional differences in nursing organizational characteristics (work environment, workload, BSN
percentage), relate to differences in three obstetric outcomes and disparities in outcomes in 867 hospital
observations from 2005, 2015, 2019, or 2023 in 26 states (Aim 1). We will study how longitudinal changes
across time points, including “post”-pandemic, in nursing organizational characteristics influence changes in
the three outcomes and disparities in these outcomes in a panel of 173 hospitals in 19 states (Aim 2). The Aim
2 panel comprises 309,670 deliveries per year. The study will capitalize on the availability of four national data
sets, comprising nurse survey (National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators, RN4CAST) and patient data
(Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Data, state patient discharge data). This study
addresses the NINR mission: “To solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy—optimizing
health and advancing health equity into the future.” Our longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches along with
broad geographic representation will provide actionable evidence for hospital administrators and professional
groups."
10988582,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Insufficiency of the placenta due to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and fetal congenital heart
disease can lead to chronic in utero hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia increases the risk of neurodevelopmental
disorders by disrupting the ""placenta-brain"" axis. Furthermore, the effects of chronic hypoxia on the developing
brain include disrupted energy metabolism and epigenome disruption, also called the metabolic-epigenetic
axis. Rodent models of prenatal hypoxia are useful for studying the complex relationship between the placenta,
brain, and epigenome.
We developed 4D in utero Oxy-wavelet MRI (4D-uMRI) technology for simultaneous structural and temporal
mitochondrial dynamics assessment. We applied this technique to elucidate the variable metabolic dynamics of
multiple models of prenatal injury. We have additional expertise in modeling prenatal brain injury and analyzing
the effects of injury on the molecular phenotype of the developing brain through single nucleus multi-omics.
In this proposal, we will leverage our combined expertise to study the effects of chronic hypoxia on the
placenta, brain, and epigenome. Our team has expertise in neuroscience, imaging, pathology, and placental
biology. This study allows us to derive a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between metabolic
profiling and molecular phenotype. We will compare normoxic litters to animals exposed to 11% inspired
oxygen from embryonic day 14.5 to 17.5. In Aim 1, we will use 4D-uMRI studies to determine to examine the
relationship between placental structural anomalies and brain structural and metabolic dysfunction from
chronic hypoxia. The study will provide insight into whether there is a direct relationship between the extent of
placental insufficiency and brain metabolic disruption and growth parameters. In Aim 2, we will assess the
brain's metabolic response to hypoxia to test the relationship between the extent of metabolic dysfunction and
disruption of the transcriptome and epigenome through single nucleus multi-omic sequencing. The study
proposes an innovative approach to testing the correlation between the extent of metabolic disruption and
molecular phenotype. Together, these experiments will allow us to recognize novel correlations between
structure, function, and molecular disruption to discover novel targets for treating the neurodevelopmental
deficits from chronic hypoxic brain injury."
10989063,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous
system (CNS), and it is considered the most common non-traumatic debilitating neurologic disease in young
adults. Based on recent advances in the understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying MS, it has
become evident that clinical relapse and progressive accumulation of disability are driven by different
pathological processes. Importantly, current therapies for MS mostly target the chronic inflammatory component
mediating clinical relapse, and they are effective in modifying the disease course and in managing symptoms.
Relapse-independent disease progression, on the other hand, is to a large extent driven by the degeneration of
chronically demyelinated and hence more vulnerable axons. Hence, myelin restoration has emerged as a
promising strategy toward a regenerative treatment for MS. At present, however, we are only at the very
beginning of developing practical approaches with the potential to promote myelin regeneration in vivo in the
human brain, and therapeutic agents that limit progressive disease mechanisms and promote CNS repair
remain an important unmet challenge in MS clinical practice. Thus, there is a critical need to broaden the scope
of druggable targets to advance the design of myelin regenerating therapies for MS. To address this need, we
propose here to explore the role of a novel glutamate-driven signaling pathway that is initiated in maturing
oligodendrocytes (OLGs), the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), through activation of the
sodium-dependent glutamate transporter GLT-1, also known as excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) or
solute carrier family 1 member 2 (SLC1A2). In MS, and particularly in progressive MS, there is evidence that
this pathway is impaired, thereby limiting efficient myelin repair. Importantly, our preliminary data provide
compelling evidence that loss of GLT-1 in maturing OLGs limits myelin repair in the cuprizone model that reflects
features of particularly progressive stages of MS. In light of the glutamate homeostasis regulating role of GLT-1
in astrocytes, characterizing mechanisms downstream of GLT-1 activation in maturing OLGs represents a
critical step toward the identification of potential therapeutic targets. In this context, our preliminary data point
toward a critical role of the small GTPase RhoB and its unique functional roles in regulating endosomal and
myelin protein trafficking mechanisms. By characterizing the role of a promising new signaling cascade and
by investigating a molecular mechanism targeting more mature OLGs rather than OLG progenitor cells, our
studies address major gaps in the field. Notably, there is increasing evidence for an involvement of Rho
GTPase signaling and protein targeting in CNS myelin repair, and Rho GTPases emerge as promising
therapeutic targets. Thus, in the long-term, the proposed studies are anticipated to provide novel insight into
the molecular mechanisms modulating CNS myelin regeneration and their potential for therapeutic
intervention toward stimulating CNS myelin repair."
10994881,"Project Summary:
Motor learning is fundamental for humans to become proficient in daily activities, such as self-care, work, and
leisure. Two fundamental components of motor learning in humans, motor adaptation and skill learning, are
critical for acquiring new activities. For example, when learning a new sport, such as pickleball, one adapts
previously learned tennis skills (adaptation) while also learning components unique to the sport at hand (skill
learning). This proposal details a set of studies aimed at understanding the functional neuroanatomy of
these two learning processes. Converging evidence implicates a major role of posterior parietal cortex (PPC)
in visuomotor learning. We have previously shown that left, but not right, posterior parietal lesions in stroke
patients prevent motor adaptation with both the contralesional and ipsilesional arms, indicating that learning is
lateralized to the left hemisphere. This proposal will utilize two types of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) in
humans to ask the following questions: Are there hemisphere-specific effects on the two types of motor
learning?, and can learning and/or transfer be facilitated by excitatory stimulation to posterior parietal
cortex? We will examine interlimb transfer of learning as a reflection of consolidation of effector-independent
motor memories. Our overarching hypothesis is that HD-tDCS delivered exclusively to the left PPC will facilitate
learning and/or transfer in each of the adaptation and skill learning tasks, and that this facilitation will be plausibly
attributable to motor consolidation between trials. We will test these hypotheses through three aims that address
1) whether anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) delivered to left, but not right,
posterior parietal cortex will facilitate visuomotor adaptation and interlimb transfer in both arms, 2) whether
anodal HD-tDCS delivered to left, but not right, posterior parietal cortex will facilitate skill learning and interlimb
transfer in both arms, and 3) whether double pulse TMS delivered to the left, but not the right, PPC, either prior
to movement or during movement, will affect learning and transfer in both tasks. This last aim will help to elucidate
the mechanisms underlying posterior parietal cortex mediated learning. Our pilot data strongly support a
substantial effect of NIBS to the left PPC on distinct aspects of these two motor learning processes. The
information gained from this study should prove essential for the optimal translation of non-invasive
brain stimulation techniques to motor learning in rehabilitation. This proposal brings together the
complimentary expertise of two research programs: Dr. Sainburg has developed the proposed behavioral
paradigms, related software/hardware, and his team has expertise in the neural basis of motor control, learning,
and lateralization. Dr. Tunik studies the neural foundations of visual-motor coordination for upper limb
movements. His team has specific expertise in the brain stimulation techniques proposed. Both teams have been
effectively working together for over a year."

It is critical to understand risk and protective factors for health to optimize developmental outcomes and inform
prevention of poor health behaviors across the lifespan. Research using longitudinal designs, multiple levels of
analysis, and experimental clinical trials are needed. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
death worldwide. The origins of adult CVD begin prenatally: High prenatal maternal depressive symptoms
robustly predict offspring CVD risk. However, knowledge on risk and protective factors for CVD for offspring of
mothers with high depressive symptoms has been correlational. There is a lack of experimental work using a
randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to understand potential mechanisms that contribute to children's CVD
risk following exposure to high maternal prenatal depressive symptoms across multiple levels (e.g., maternal
and child behaviors, physiology) over time. Although efficacious interventions to diminish depressive symptoms
among pregnant women exist, research has not investigated whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive
symptoms can reduce offspring cardiovascular risk. The current study proposes to leverage a RCT of an
effective psychosocial intervention for prenatal maternal depression to test whether reducing prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms improves offspring cardiovascular health at ages 3-4 years. We hypothesize that the
prenatal intervention operates by reducing both prenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms to improve child
outcomes. This study will identify intervention targets for offspring of mothers with high prenatal depressive
symptoms to reduce cardiovascular risk. These goals will be accomplished by building on a RCT
(R01MH109662) of an established psychosocial intervention that effectively reduces maternal prenatal

increases rigor of the existing correlational research by using an experimental RCT design. The following 3

quality of food the mother feeds her child, maternal feeding behaviors, and modeling of eating behaviors at 3
years. Aim 2: To test whether reducing prenatal maternal depressive symptoms improves child diet, eating
behaviors, sleep, and physical activity at 3 years. Aim 3: To test whether reducing prenatal maternal
depressive symptoms reduces child CVD risk at 3 and 4 years, including BMI, waist circumference, body fat,
blood pressure, and arterial stiffness. This project will provide the strongest evidence to date for a mechanistic
model of prenatal maternal depressive symptoms' influence on child cardiovascular health. Importantly, the

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating disease, in which pain is the primary symptom that prompts
patients to seek medical care. Currently, there are not any safe and effective treatments for OA and associated
pain that have reached FDA approval. The association between pain and OA is not well understood, and
radiographic images do not correlate with pain severity. I propose to use a novel microphysiological system
equipped with cartilage tissue, synovial-like tissue with fibroblasts, and macrophages that are innervated with
human neurites to study acute pain associated with neuro-immune interactions that occur during OA. I
hypothesize that a positive feedback loop between neuro-immune interactions contributes to the ongoing pain
and hypersensitivity associated with OA.
To test this hypothesis, I will use our novel microphysiological system to first understand the influence of synovial-
like tissue inflammatory molecules on innervating neurons through the treatment of human DRG with different
conditioned mediums from OA-like cartilage tissue and inflamed synovial-like tissue. I will then investigate the
role of chemokines on nociception, with a focus on chemokine CXCL-1 through a series of experiments such as
the exogenous treatment of CXCL-1 and assessment of conditioned medium through proteomics. Second, I will
assess the role of neuropeptides SP and CGRP on synovial immune cells. I will begin by assessing the
contribution of macrophages to inflammatory output in the synovial-like tissue. Then I will use exogenous
treatments of SP and CGRP and innervation to specify mechanisms of inflammation promoted by these
neuropeptides. This proposed work will broadly apply to OA pain, mediating therapeutic targets and mechanisms
behind synovial-related acute OA pain. Lastly, it can be used to model other musculoskeletal diseases, such as
pain in intervertebral disc degeneration. This proposal highlights the contributions made by the PI throughout the
training, which will primarily focus on the assessment of chemokines on nociception and how neuropeptides
affect immune cells in the synovial-like tissue. Successful completion of this proposal is the critical step to
providing a platform for understanding neuro-immune interactions, testing pain-mediating therapeutics on human
tissue, and developing disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs."

Despite recent progress on understanding the mechanisms of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), no
successful treatment for ALD is available. Alcohol metabolism in the liver leads to decreased levels of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and increased NADH/ NAD+ ratio resulting in impaired alcohol
metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The widely accepted notion that alcohol induces
mitochondrial dysfunction is largely derived from the results on chronic alcohol-fed rats. However, we and
others recently demonstrated that chronic alcohol-fed mice have increased mitochondrial respiration with
increased number of megamitochondria in the liver. Increased mitochondrial respiration regenerates NAD+,
which can be further used for alcohol metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2,
suggesting alcohol induces an adaptive response to facilitate alcohol metabolism by increasing mitochondria
respiration. It has long been known that accumulation of hepatic megamitochondria is associated with better
outcomes in human ALD although the exact role and mechanisms of megamitochondria in the pathogenesis of
ALD are unknown. We recently showed that alcohol decreases mitochondria fission protein dynamin-related
protein 1 (DRP1) (gene name DNM1L) in mouse livers and human alcohol-associated hepatitis resulting in
increased megamitochondria formation. We further demonstrated that chronically accumulated
megamitochondria are maladaptive resulting in impaired NAD+ regeneration, increased mtDNA release and
cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune response in alcohol-fed mice. Liver-specific Dnm1l knockout (L-Dnm1l
KO) mice developed spontaneous liver tumors and was further exacerbated by alcohol feeding. Deletion of
mitochondrial fusion protein (mitofusin 1 and 2) to regain liver mitochondrial “stasis” remarkably abolished
cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune response and tumorigenesis in L-Dnm1l KO mice. The goal of this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms for how megamitochondria are maladaptive to promote mtDNA
release and how cGAS-STING pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of ALD and liver cancer. The central
hypothesis is that chronically accumulated megamitochondria impair mitophagy and increase BAX/BAK pore
formation to promote mtDNA release and cGAS-STING-mediated innate immune response resulting in alcohol-
induced liver injury and tumorigenesis, all of which can be restrained by re-establishing hepatic mitochondrial
stasis. The study will identify novel mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis in regulating
hepatic inflammation and liver tumorigenesis in ALD, which may help develop new therapeutic options by
targeting mitochondria for ALD."

The nation’s first healthy checkout policy was implemented in Berkeley, CA in 2021 and will be enforced in 2022,
presenting an opportunity to understand policy effects on diet quality. This policy prohibits high-sugar and high-
sodium products from checkouts, an area known for impulse purchasing. By potentially lowering consumption of
sugary beverages, sweets, and salty snacks—the most common items at checkout—this policy could reduce
population risk of obesity and types 2 diabetes. Voluntary checkout standards adopted in other countries have
successfully decreased purchases of unhealthy foods and beverages and increased purchases of healthy ones,
indicating that a mandatory healthy checkout policy could meaningfully improve diet quality. However, because
Berkeley’s policy is the first of its kind, there are no studies on the degree to which a healthy checkout policy
changes store food environments and the healthfulness of food and beverage purchases—an objective proxy
for population diet quality. This research will evaluate the long-term impact of the nation’s first healthy checkout
policy on the healthfulness of store food environments and purchases. By leveraging a natural experiment, these
outcomes will be compared between Berkeley stores and stores in three comparison cities using synthetic control
and difference-in-differences methods. The first aim is to assess the impact of the policy on store environments
at checkout and elsewhere in the store, including the prevalence of unhealthy and healthy products and their
contents of added sugar, calorie, and sodium in all 26 intervention stores and a random sample of 81 comparison
stores. The second aim is to assess policy impact on purchases of (a) small sizes of snack foods and beverages
commonly sold at checkout and (b) all sizes of these products (which accounts for substitution) using store- and
product- level sales data from 16 intervention and 172 comparison stores. The third aim is to identify
implementation factors that influence policy effectiveness, such as policy support, costs, reach, and stakeholder
reactions using interviews with city staff, policymakers, and retailers and surveys of Berkeley residents. This
evaluation leverages the baseline and 1-year post-baseline store environment data collected by the research
team using a novel photo-based tool. The proposed research is expected to provide the first evidence on the
effectiveness of a mandatory healthy checkout policy for improving food environments and store sales and the
factors that facilitate or pose barriers to implementation, which can inform policy decisions in other jurisdictions."

The small freshwater cnidarian Hydra has played a crucial role in several scientific breakthroughs, most
notably being the first animal where regeneration was discovered in 1744. Over the years, different Hydra
species contributed to fundamental findings, but Hydra vulgaris has become the standard ""Hydra model"" in
modern molecular research. With a chromosome-level genome assembly and tools to test gene function, H.
vulgaris is a prime model for developmental and regenerative biology but is also an emerging model in various
fields including neuroscience and microbiome research. In contrast, Hydra oligactis, another Hydra species,
remains underutilized despite its biologically relevant distinct features. Unlike H. vulgaris, H. oligactis
exhibits deficiencies in regenerating its aboral end and undergoes senescence and death upon gamete
production. The sharp contrasts between these closely related species offer a unique comparative platform for
exploring molecular mechanisms in regeneration and aging.
Despite being behind in tools and resources, H. oligactis can be reliably cultured, making it a promising
candidate for functional studies. Completion of the proposed aims will bridge the gap between the two species:
 1. Build Genomic and Transcriptomic Resources: Develop a chromosome-scale genome assembly with
 gene regulatory annotations, and a single-cell expression atlas for H. oligactis, paralleling the resources
 available for H. vulgaris.
 2. Implement Transgenesis and siRNA Knockdown: Establish transgenesis in H. oligactis and create
 transgenic lines that express fluorescent proteins in specific lineages. These lines will enable the
 optimization of gene knockdown through siRNA electroporation.
 3. Develop CRISPR Gene Editing: Utilize the inducible egg production in H. oligactis to troubleshoot
 CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing. The immediate goal is to tag the endogenous EF1-alpha gene, a
 strategy that will inform future gene editing attempts in both H. oligactis and H. vulgaris.
The completion of these aims will equip H. oligactis with tools and resources comparable to H. vulgaris,
enabling functional studies and comparative analyses. This comparative approach holds potential implications
for various scientific fields, including developmental and regenerative biology, aging, neuroscience,
microbiome research, and biophysics. This project is therefore highly responsive to the FOA (PAR-21-167),
which calls for the development and improvement of animal models that are relevant to multiple NIH
Institutes."

The purpose of this NIH F31 application is to obtain support for the PI, Ashley Adamson, to carry out mentored
research and career development activities such that the PI obtains the necessary experience and training to
become a rigorous independent researcher. The project goal is to leverage the PI’s current skillset with a rigorous
training program to position her to study the key proteins, pathways, and mechanisms behind environmentally
caused neurodegenerative diseases, namely Parkinson’s disease dementia. The primary objective of this
research proposal is to investigate the role of cell cycle regulatory proteins in facilitating cognitive impairments
caused by trichloroethylene exposure in the context of Parkinson’s disease dementia. Work from the lab of Dr.
Briana De Miranda, the PI’s sponsor, has shown that exposure to trichloroethylene inhalation induces
nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegeneration, motor deficits, and alpha-synuclein accumulation in mice.
Furthermore, the PI showed that trichloroethylene exposure induces cognitive deficits congruent with those
commonly observed in Parkinson’s disease. However, it is currently unknown by what mechanisms
trichloroethylene facilitates these deficits. This project aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by
which cognitive impairment is induced by trichloroethylene exposure by evaluating the roles of aberrant CDK5
activation in pathogenic protein accumulation (Aim 1) and increased cellular senescence in neural stem cell
populations (Aim 2). The long-term objective of the PI’s research is to identify the role for environmental
exposures in influencing the significant heterogeneity of cognitive symptomology in Parkinson’s disease, and to
identify disease modifying therapeutic strategies to stop the progression of the disease.
The proposed training plan for Ashley Adamson is sponsored by Dr. Briana De Miranda and co-sponsored by
Dr. Erik Roberson. The overall goal of the training plan is to provide Ashley with the conceptual and technical
skills necessary to establish a strong foundation for a career in academic research. The training plan has been
developed with activities to foster Ashley’s training in 3 crucial areas: 1) conceptual and technical research,
including studies in neurodegeneration, cognition, and neurotoxicology; 2) statistical rigor, reproducibility, and
transparency; including preparation in ethical research practices; and 3) career development, including training
in mentorship, teaching, and scientific communication. This proposal will uniquely prepare the PI to conduct
rigorous hypothesis-driven research in neurotoxicology and neurodegenerative disease while also curating the
skills necessary for a becoming a competent scientist, teacher, and mentor in academic science."
10996811,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The winged-helix DNA-binding FoxA transcription factors (TFs) play major roles in the development and
homeostasis of many organs. Importantly, FoxA proteins are expressed early and continuously in many tissues
and are essential both during development and postnatally for morphogenesis, glucose metabolism, and
expression of multiple organ-specific genes. Mutations in FoxA proteins are linked to cancer in multiple tissue
types (including the salivary gland), developmental defects that result in Parkinson-like phenotypes, and glucose
dysregulation, causing hypoglycemia. However, the identity of the downstream effectors and the extent of
coordination of FoxA proteins with other TFs to accomplish morphogenesis and regulate metabolic function are
largely unknown. Identifying these downstream effectors and their mechanistic nuances becomes possible by
studying the single Drosophila orthologue Fork head (Fkh) that represents all three FoxA members: FOXA1,
FOXA2, and FOXA3. Like FoxA proteins in vertebrates, Fkh is required for morphogenesis and maintenance of
organs in Drosophila, including the embryonic salivary gland (SG). In addition to its role in organ formation, Fkh
is known to coordinate with two other TFs, Sage and Senseless (Sens), to maintain SG viability and to regulate
the “secretome” – the collection of secreted products made by the SG. By performing ChIP-sequencing in parallel
with scRNA-sequencing followed by computational analysis, we will uncover the mechanistic details of how Fkh
coordinates with Sage and Sens to regulate the secretome (Aim 1). Furthermore, I will use our computational
analysis to identify candidate partner TFs of Fkh to then perform a mutational screen and look for morphological
phenotypes to characterize possible co-regulators of Fkh for morphogenesis (Aim 2). Through these proposed
experiments in Aims 1 and 2, the mechanistic details of how Fkh coordinates with Sage and Sens to regulate
the secretome can be elucidated while uncovering and characterizing co-regulators of Fkh for morphogenesis.
In addition to controlling organ form and function, FoxA family proteins also play a role in metabolism. Currently,
the SG is not known to have any metabolic roles but recent findings from our lab and others indicate that the SG
secretome may have additional endocrine functions related to systemic growth. In Drosophila, salivary gland
secreted factor (Sgsf) has been discovered as a SG secreted peptide that acts upon the AKT-MTOR pathway to
ultimately affect systemic growth. By studying Fkhs role in regulating secreted factors from the SG, the novel
function of the SG acting as endocrine organ can be further understood. To study this, I will utilize the biotinylating
enzyme BirA*G3 in conjunction with mass spectrometry and confocal imagery to explore the potential secretion
of metabolites from the SG. Candidate metabolites identified through these will then be tested for metabolic
consequences within both the larval and adult stage (Aim 3). The outcomes from these experiments will provide
new insights upon Fkh regulation of secretion and the SG acting as an endocrine organ."

This project is a renewal of an ongoing longitudinal study of brain structure, function, and cognition, the Dallas
Area Longitudinal Lifespan Aging Study (D.A.L.L.A.S) with 3 waves of data spanning ~8 years. This proposal
seeks renewal of this project for two additional waves (W4 and W5), as well as the addition of a new
enrichment cohort. We hypothesize that a more granular approach to the study of cognitive neuroscience will
advance understanding of the role of immune, inflammatory, metabolic, and energetic function mechanisms on
individual differences in age-related change to brain structure, function and cognition, both across the lifespan
and within-individuals across time. Thus, the study will be further enriched with the addition of select blood-
based biomarkers of inflammation, cellular aging, and neuronal and glial integrity as well as neurometabolites
using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at 7Tesla, and submillimeter measures of intracortical
myelin content and cortical lamina imaging. A deeper understanding of the cellular activity that potentially
influences brain structure and function, and ultimately cognition can be obtained by the multi-modal pairing of
these neuroimaging techniques. MR spectra can act as proxies for variables otherwise difficult to measure, but
paramount to the aging process, such as energy expenditure, neuroinflammation, and neural inhibition and
excitation. The general goal of the renewal of this longitudinal project is to untangle the independent,
interactive, and synergistic relationships among micro-meso-macro scale aging. The specific aims focus on
testing biomarker-structure-function-cognition associations across the adult lifespan and within-individual
across the waves utilizing sophisticated multivariate latent modeling techniques which allow for simultaneous
estimation of all variables. Using within-person change information obtained from the previous project period to
guide MRS regions of interest is a novel means of beginning to understand/identify what cellular/molecular
process might underlie more established brain changes (e.g., regions that weaken in their ability to up-
modulate activation to difficulty over time at the individual level). For example, those who maintain BOLD
modulation to difficulty over the previous 8 years may display a healthier metabolic signature, such as lower
inhibitory or lower excitation indices, lower markers of inflammation or greater neuroantioxidant concentrations.
Only the pairing of longitudinal design with multi-modal imaging can address these questions. Studies
assessing individual differences in change and data sets with greater than 3 time points are rare and sorely
needed to increase reliability, decrease noise and to take full advantage of advanced nonlinear statistical
methods. The proposed renewal project will yield 14-year change data across 5 waves and stands to add
important, innovative, and novel information to the cellular, molecular, and metabolic factors that underlie
relatively healthy or pathological aging trajectories, such as Alzheimer’s disease."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a relatively commonneurodevelopmental disorder (NDD), for which hundreds
of large-effect risk genes have been identified. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ASD remain
unknown. ASD is commonly comorbid with disorders caused by cilia defects, but the possibility that cilia defects
underlie ASD pathogenesis has not been systematically investigated. My dissertation work addresses this gap
in knowledge by investigating the role of large-effect ASD risk genes in cilia formation using complementary
model systems. To date, I have demonstrated that six high-confidence ASD risk genes localize to the cilium and
are required for their formation, using both in vivo Xenopus models and in vitro human cells and transcriptomics.
Included in these genes is the leading ASD risk gene, SYNGAP1, which has a canonical role in synaptic
plasticity. My results show that it also plays a role earlier in brain development at the cilium, reframing its potential
molecular contributions to ASD risk. The work proposed here will dissect the domains of SYNGAP1 necessary
for its localization and function at the cilium using the high-throughput Xenopus model (Aim 1A). Then these
findings will be translated to rodent models to dissect SYNGAP1 localization and function in a neural context,
both at cellular and organ-level resolution using Syngap1 mutant rats (Aim 1B). To model human
haploinsufficiency, we will complement this work by analyzing cilia phenotypes in SYNGAP1 patient iPSC-
derived neurons (Aim 1C). Results from these studies will shift our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying ASD pathogenesis, particularly for the leading ASD risk gene SYNGAP1, with implications for other
‘synaptic’ ASD risk genes. This proposed work and training plan will prepare me for success in the K00 phase
by providing technical training in advanced microscopy, image analysis, tissue processing, bioinformatics, and
iPSC culture, as well as professional skills and intellectual experience in dissecting molecular mechanisms of
NDDs. In Aim 2 (the K00 phase), I will continue to pursue my interests in understanding the molecular
mechanisms of NDDs by investigating the role of lipids in the pathogenesis of NDDs. I will identify a postdoctoral
laboratory that studies NDDs and can support my training in cutting-edge techniques in lipid biology, lipidomics,
and transcriptomics while I develop professional, communication, and inclusive leadership skills. With the tools,
professional skills, and technical skills I develop in the K00 phase, I will be well-positioned to start my
independent research laboratory studying NDDs and create an inclusive environment to lead a diverse team of
trainees and scientists."

 Hispanic women working as domestic cleaners are subject to both environmental and occupational
hazards because of where they live and work, and this makes this particular group of Hispanics especially
vulnerable. To our knowledge, studies have not examined the health impact of exposures to volatile organic
compounds (VOC) among Hispanic women who both live in environmental justice neighborhoods and work as
domestic cleaners.
 Despite their large numbers in this country, US labor laws generally exclude domestic cleaners and thus
they have limited protections to, among other things: organize, earn minimum wage or overtime pay, have regular
breaks, and a healthy and safe work environment. This is particularly true in Texas (TX) which ranks among the
states with the highest number of these workers, yet their annual mean wage in TX is among the lowest in the
nation. Also, domestic cleaners, particularly in South Texas, are overwhelmingly minorities and are primarily
Hispanic or Latina women.
 Women working as domestic cleaners are subject to a number of environmental and occupational hazards.
For example, exposure to hazardous chemicals in cleaning products, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
which have been associated with respiratory outcomes (e.g., wheeze, asthma, upper/lower respiratory tract
irritation). VOCs are also ubiquitous in the environment and the indoor and neighborhood environments represent
important determinants of total personal exposure, even among occupationally exposed person. Thus, in addition
to work-related VOC exposure, Hispanic women working as domestic cleaners may experience `double jeopardy',
with potentially significant VOC exposures in their home environments.
 Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of environmental and occupational hazards and related health
outcomes among vulnerable Hispanic women. The objective of this study is to use a community-engaged
approach to characterize individual, occupational, and neighborhood-level factors that influence personal air VOC
exposure among this overburdened group of Hispanic women in San Antonio, Texas, and to explore associations
between these exposures with biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. We will achieve this goal through
an ongoing academic-community partnership with a grassroots organization, Domésticas Unidas, an organization
that provides outreach and educational activities targeted toward Hispanic, often undocumented, women working
in San Antonio, primarily as domestic cleaners. The aims of this study are to (1) Assess personal air VOC exposure
and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress among at-risk Hispanic women; (2) Evaluate key, potentially
modifiable, determinants of personal air VOC exposure of at-risk Hispanic women at home and work, and; (3)
Evaluate the association of personal air VOC exposure with biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress
among at-risk Hispanic women."

Metabolic reprogramming plays a critical role in immune cell activation, differentiation, and function in response
to severe sepsis. Broad defects in leukocyte bioenergetics underlie the immunometabolic paralysis in sepsis.
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is an investigational drug and the prototypic inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
(PDK) that inhibits the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) by reversible phosphorylation.
PDC catalyzes the rate-limiting step in aerobic glucose oxidation in mitochondria. Our Central Hypothesis is that
DCA represents a novel, mechanism-based therapy that targets the underlying mitochondrial bioenergetic failure
responsible for sepsis. Accordingly, to evaluate DCA’s safety and therapeutic potential more rigorously in septic
shock, Medosome Biotec, in collaboration with the University of Florida, Wake Forest University, and
Northwestern University, will evaluate various DCA intravenous dosages for the treatment of sepsis in pigs as a
large animal model of sepsis. The Specific Aims (SA) of this STTR Phase I/Phase II Fast-track grant proposal
focus on conducting pharmacokinetic, safety and efficacy experiments and establishing Chemistry,
Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) information. Following a Pre-IND meeting with the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research (CDER), we will complete all IND-enabling studies (GLP, toxicity studies, etc.) required for the
IND application and, upon approval, apply to initiate future clinical trials evaluating DCA as a treatment for

Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) is a serious complication of twin pregnancies, affecting up to 15%
of twins sharing the same placenta (monochorionic twins). TTTS occurs when monochorionic twins develop
abnormal connections (anastomosis) in placental vessels resulting in imbalanced blood flow: one twin (the
recipient) receives more blood at the expense of the other (donor) twin with both at increased risk for demise
and compromised neurodevelopmental outcomes. The natural history of TTTS is dismal with perinatal losses up
to 70-100%. Although fetoscopic laser photocoagulation of the placental anastomoses has improved outcomes,
losses remain as high as 34% with cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental impairment occurring in 10-18%.
Thus, margins for improvement remain and controversy exists over optimal type of laser surgery, appropriate
definition of TTTS and when to intervene. Surgical planning requires accurate localization of the umbilical cord
insertions and placenta surface vessels, which remains challenging with 2D magnetic resonance (MR) or
ultrasound (US) images. Diagnosis of TTTS and response to laser surgery is based on user dependent, indirect
measures of placental function (e.g. umbilical arterial and venous Doppler assessment, maximum vertical pocket
of amniotic fluid, fetal bladder size). In addition, fetal growth discordance, a critical reflection of TTTS severity, is
also based on user dependent 2D US techniques. Improved preoperative placental vascular visualization, direct
measures of placental function and user independent measures of fetal size are needed. We propose to build
on our prior work developing CNN to perform rapid 3D uterine reconstructions with 2D HASTE images with
flattening of placental images to improve visualization of the placental surface vessels. To directly assess
placental function, we will build upon our prior work where we found oxygen transport correlated with discordance
and predicted birth weight in monochorionic twins. Instead of monitoring relative T2* changes, we propose to
quantify T2* at baseline and with maternal oxygen. We also use intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) with and
without flow compensation (FC) to explore pulsatile flow in the fetal villous tree. Finally, we will extend our prior
work that identified key points for fetal pose providing limb length and motion statistics in singletons, to twins and
add estimation of fetal intracranial, bladder and body volumes. In summary, to address the unmet needs in
monochorionic twins, we propose the following aims: Aim 1) Provide rapid visualization of the placental surface
vessels and umbilical cord insertion in native and flattened space; Aim 2) Characterize local placental function
pre and post laser ablation; and Aim 3) Calculate discordance of intracranial, bladder and body volumes, fetal
limb biometrics and motion statistics pre and 4-6 weeks post treatment. If successful, we will be poised to perform
a clinical study assessing the impact of these advancements on surgical planning and outcomes and determine
application to earlier gestational ages."

Staphylococcus aureus is a pervasive pathogen that causes invasive disease in humans. The type 7b secretion
system (T7bSS) of S. aureus transports a specific set of factors across the bacterial envelope, which are required
for S. aureus virulence and persistence in infected host tissues. Secretion of these proteins is dependent on the
expression of the ess operon, which encodes T7bSS structural proteins that assemble into a transport complex
within the bacterial envelope. The mechanisms of T7bSS expression and assembly are not well understood. Dr.
Bobrovskyy's research established a purification protocol for the T7bSS complex and identified accessory gene
regulator (Agr) and peptidoglycan hydrolase EssH as factors necessary to support T7b secretion. Thus, the overall
objectives of this proposal are to reveal the composition, stoichiometry and assembly of the purified T7bSS
complex (Aim 1), determine the mechanism whereby peptidoglycan hydrolase EssH supports T7b secretion (Aim
2), and elucidate T7bSS regulation by Agr (Aim 3). Together, these aims will test an overarching hypothesis that
the ess locus of S. aureus is regulated by the Agr pathway, leading to the assembly of the T7bSS complex that
spans the envelope and permits substrate translocation. In Aim 1, purification of the T7bSS complex coupled
with single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and cross-linking mass spectrometry will be utilized to
investigate the structural components that enable translocation of substrates across staphylococcal cell envelope.
In Aim 2, a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches will be used to investigate the contribution of
EssH to the assembly of T7bSS complex and substrate translocation across a thick peptidoglycan cell wall. In
Aim 3, the role of the post-transcriptional regulator RNAIII, a component of the staphylococcal Agr pathway,
and of other intermediate factors, will be examined for ess gene regulation. In addition, the proposed training
and career development activities are intended to provide Dr. Bobrovskyy with the experience and tools that will
allow him to successfully transition to independence in the field of bacterial physiology and pathogenesis. The
collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment in the Department of Microbiology at the University of
Chicago, and access to the state-of-the-art equipment at the core facilities, such as the Advanced Electron
Microscopy Facility, are well suited for the candidate's proposal. The candidate's mentors Drs. Missiakas and
Zhao, will assure the progress of the research and training objectives. Dr. Missiakas is an internationally
recognized scientist in the field of staphylococcal protein secretion, with a strong history of mentoring trainees,
many of whom went onto having careers in academia and industry. Dr. Zhao is a structural biologist who
specializes in cryo-EM analysis of membrane protein complexes and will provide training and support to the
candidate in this area. Dr. Bobrovskyy also assembled an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Phoebe Rice, Jim
Slauch and Sam Light, who will assist the candidate in his research and training. Overall, this award will enable
Dr. Bobrovskyy to attain his goals and propel his career towards independence."

Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of brain aging that may contribute to declines in function and neurodegenerative
diseases. As the resident macrophage of the brain, microglial are crucial to brain maintenance but have been
demonstrated to take on pro-inflammatory phenotypes with aging. The proposed research will examine the role
of microglia-specific epigenetic mechanisms in aging and determine the effects of obesity and aging interactions
on microglia phenotypic heterogeneity. We will determine whether aberrant age-related microglia-specific
epigenetic patterns can be reversed by heterochronic plasma approaches. Additionally, we will determine how
microglia subpopulations differ with age and obesity at a single-cell level with special interests in lipid-droplet-
accumulating microglia (LDAM). The goals of the training are to: 1) obtain a strong knowledge and foundation
in animal and nutritional models of anti-aging and obesity 2) gain hands-on experience in technologies and
bioinformatic skills needed for various omics approaches in specific hippocampal cells and at a single-cell level
3) apply these skills to achieve the research aims outlined in this proposal and 5) gain experience and improve
oral and presentation skills, manuscript and grant writing to enable a transition to independence. In Aim 1, we
hypothesize that exposure of old mice to young plasma will reverse age-related microglia-specific DNA
modifications to restore ‘youthful’ epigenomic patterns. This is based on the premise that DNA modifications are
key regulators of the diverse phenotypes required for the fulfillment of microglia functions which are disrupted in
aging. We will determine whether the administration of plasma from young into old mice can reverse age-related
microglial-specific hippocampal epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in Cx3cr1:NuTRAP mice using whole
genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (WGoxBS) and RNA sequencing, respectively. These studies will identify
specific genomic sites amenable to the rejuvenating interventions and serve as targets for future epigenome
editing studies. In Aim 2, we will determine how the interaction of obesity and aging affect microglia
heterogeneity. We hypothesize that high-fat diet leads to expansion of pathological LDAM resulting in impaired
microglial function, which can be reversed by late-life calorie restriction. We will use single-cell transcriptomic
analysis, bulk transcriptomics and microglia functional assays (phagocytic uptake and cytokine/chemokine
analysis) to determine changes in microglia subpopulations in dietary-induced obese mice with age. In addition,
we will determine whether starting calorie restriction at 12 months in dietary-induced obese mice can mitigate
the effects of obesity on microglia heterogeneity. This will help identify mechanistic insights into microglia
heterogeneity, LDAM and obesity-associated neuroinflammation. In total, the training goals and objectives will
provide the needed skills and expertise to pursue a research career focused on developing anti-aging
interventions."

As animals interact with their environment, they build and accrue sound associations with behaviorally relevant
outcomes. The mammalian auditory system can be modified by experience and by behavioral context and
supports the ability to build these associations. The auditory cortex (AC) supports the ability for animals to
learn that particular sounds can signal rewards. The neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) can
be re-shaped by audiomotor learning, taking the form of changes at the single-neuron and population level.
This learning-induced plasticity decreases after animals are trained at expert levels of behavioral performance
for several weeks until the cortical map appears to renormalize and neural responses revert to a near pre-
learning state. The plasticity that emerges across learning is not preserved in the cortex during the overtraining
phase, yet animals are able to retain task performance. The overall objective of this proposal is to if A1 tutors
or offloads these combined representations of sound and action to another pathway for long-term use, which
supports long term execution of the task and the renormalization of A1. Our central hypothesis is that the A1
tutors subcortical auditory regions—the medial geniculate body (MGB) and the inferior colliculus (IC)—
which subsequently store audiomotor associations. I will address this question in two aims. In Aim 1, I will
determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasticity in the IC, MGB, and AC across learning and overtraining.
In Aim 2, I will identify the causal contributions of the MGB and the IC at the expert level. To do this, I will train
mice on an auditory go/no-go task where mice learn to lick to a pure tone for a water reward (S+) and withhold
licking to another tone (S-) to avoid a timeout. We use large-scale, two-photon mesoscopic imaging to monitor
neural activity in IC neurons, MGB axons, and A1 neurons over the entire course of learning and overtraining
(28 days). I developed a new surgical preparation which allows the implantation of a single cranial window over
the IC and the AC to enable simultaneous calcium imaging of both regions and the feedforward projections
from the MGB to the AC. By tracking the same cell bodies and axons across a month of training, we examine
the sequence of stimulus-related and non-stimulus related plasticity and the nature of how learning and
overtraining impact these processes across the sensory hierarchy. Using a combination of state-of-the-art
optical tools, temporally precise optogenetics, large-scale calcium imaging, and custom computational
analyses and tools, these experiments will help us understand the nature of cortical-subcortical interactions
that support auditory learning and memory consolidation along three processing stations in the central auditory
system."
10998347,"Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric illnesses. High treatment dropout rates and poor
prognosis may be due to existing treatments inadequately addressing dysfunction in gastrointestinal (GI)
interoception (i.e., altered processing of GI sensations). Indeed, aversive conditioning theories of restrictive
eating disorders (i.e., anorexia nervosa [AN], atypical AN, and avoidant restrictive food intake disorder) posit
that heightened GI visceral sensitivity (i.e., constant monitoring and worry about GI sensations) maintains
restrictive eating disorders), yet this has not been tested. This gap is critical, particularly because high dropout
rates during treatment may be because renourishment elicits many of the same GI sensations (e.g., bloating,
fullness) that individuals with restrictive eating disorders fear. Further, it is unclear why individuals with
restrictive eating disorders exhibit altered experience of GI sensations. It may be that these individuals are
responding to different cues than those without an eating disorder due to aberrant GI physiological functioning
(e.g., gastric arrhythmias) or that they are experiencing altered perceptual representation (i.e., interoception) of
normative GI cues. It is critical to examine the mechanisms underlying altered GI experience in restrictive
eating disorders to inform treatment strategies (i.e., medical intervention, GI interoceptive exposures, or both).
 Consistent with NIMH’s Strategic Plan Goal 3 and special interest in interoception, this study will contribute
to enhancing interventions for restrictive eating disorders via the following aims: Aim 1: Determine whether
visceral sensitivity leads to the daily maintenance of restricting and compensatory behaviors using ecological
momentary assessment (EMA); Aim 2: Identify mechanisms of altered GI experience (i.e., altered GI biology,
interoception, or both) in restrictive eating disorders and determine the specificity of GI compared to cardiac
interoception for predicting eating disordered behaviors via laboratory tasks and psychophysiology.
 The proposed study will recruit adults from a university community screening positive for a restrictive eating
disorder (n = 75) for an EMA study (14 days). The baseline visit includes behavioral measures of interoception
(including GI) and electrogastrography (EGG) and electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. It is anticipated that
greater within-person visceral sensitivity will precede disordered eating behavior, and that within-person
visceral sensitivity will decrease following disordered eating behavior. Compared to a healthy comparison
sample (drawn from the sponsor and co-sponsor’s ongoing collaboration), individuals with restrictive eating
disorders will exhibit altered GI activity and altered GI interoception.
 The proposed study offers exceptional training and professional development opportunities for the
applicant, including learning to collect and clean psychophysiology data and conduct analyses in a multilevel
modeling framework. This fellowship will strengthen the applicant’s independent research skills in preparation
for their long-term career goal of obtaining a research position in a high-research output institution."

 Malaria is one of the world’s most common and deadly infectious diseases. Approximately 627,000 people, mostly
African children, die each year due to complications of malaria (WHO estimate for 2021). A unique feature of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is the adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes (iRBCs) to vascular endothelium.
Sequestration iRBCs correlates with the sequela of cerebral malaria, a devastating and often fatal consequence of the
disease. The iRBCs develop specialized surface protrusions called knobs mediating their attachment to blood vessels in
multiple organs. Formation of knobs on the surface of iRBCs mediates cytoadherence to endothelial cells. A critical
component of knobs is knob-associated histidine rich protein (KAHRP) that anchors multiple host and parasite derived
proteins to the RBC cytoskeleton. We have identified specific segments of KAHRP that mediate its self-assembly into
spiral-shaped structures by sequential participation of head-to-tail interactions. Domain mapping revealed that the amino
terminal histidine-rich segment of KAHRP functions as a critical determinant of self-assembly. Reconstitution of the
recombinant histidine-rich segment of KAHRP in knobby iRBCs disrupted the knob morphology and abrogated adhesion
of iRBCs in vitro. These results suggest a novel mechanism for disrupting the self-association of KAHRP as a potential
strategy against cytoadhesion in malaria. Guided by these preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that
disrupting specific interactions within KAHRP inhibits knob formation, thus blocking the adhesion of iRBCs to
endothelial cells. This hypothesis will be tested as follows: Aim 1: Mechanism of KAHRP self-assembly and knob
formation. Our results demonstrate that KAHRP self-assembly is mediated through interactions between its histidine rich
region and the C-terminal 5’ repeats. We have identified a specific KAHRP polypeptide that attenuated cytoadherence of
iRBCs as effectively as the KAHRP gene knockdown studies. Moreover, using phage display cDNA technology, we
identified novel KAHRP-binding peptides as potential inhibitors of the knob self-assembly process. We propose to use
erythrocyte loading of KAHRP segments as well as cell permeable peptides to quantify the formation, composition, and
dispersion of knobs using established biochemical and microscopy approaches. Aim 2: Disruption of RBC knob-
endothelial interactions. Using existing recombinant KAHRP segments and newly identified peptides by the phage
display screens, we will evaluate the disruption of iRBCs adhesion to a variety of substrates including endothelial cells,
platelets, and purified receptors. State-of-the-art imaging tools will be used to monitor real time kinetics of cytoadherence
ex vivo. Together, these studies will elucidate the mechanism of knob assembly in the Plasmodium falciparum infected
RBCs and reveal new therapeutic approaches for mitigating the adhesion of infected human RBCs to endothelial cells."
10999811,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed study seeks to determine if DNA methyltransferases from members of the microbiota contribute
to bacterial pathoadaptation in the tumor niche, direct xenogeneic epi-modifications on the human genome, and
can be exploited as therapeutic targets in cancer prevention/treatment. Within a patient’s tumor, malignant cells
are surrounded by a complex microenvironment encompassing a range of non-transformed cells and also a
diverse collection of microorganisms. For example, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is significantly enriched in
colorectal adenocarcinoma compared to adjacent normal tissue. Although cellular and animal models have
supported a role for this bacterium in cancer initiation and progression, we still have little information as to how
they directly contribute to cancer. In published work, our group has demonstrated that Fn, which is usually part
of the oral microbiome and not found in the lower gastrointestinal tract, is an invasive intracellular bacterium that
effectively colonizes the colorectal cancer (CRC) niche. In preliminary studies, we isolated and characterized the
genomes and epigenomes of >150 Fn strains from CRC tumors and the oral cavity and discovered that within
the Fn subspecies Fn subsp. animalis, there are two distinct clades that differ in their enrichment in CRC, which
we named Fn oral-clade and Fn CRC-clade. We show that Fna CRC-clade is the only Fn group significantly
enriched in human tumors and fecal specimens. Of the many differences between these two clades, perhaps
one of the most striking is their distinct DNA methylome signatures, with CRC-clade uniquely harboring Gm6ANTC
methyl-modifications. We, therefore, hypothesize that the DNA methyl-modifying enzyme (M.FnI) responsible for
m6A methylation at this motif contributes to Fn CRC-clade virulence during carcinogenesis. We propose to test
this hypothesis using genetically engineered CRC-clade clinical isolates in cell culture and animal model
experiments to determine if M.FnI regulates bacterial gene expression to promote their pathoadaptation (Aim 1).
Additionally, we speculate that M.FnI can act as a nucleomodulin to directly interfere with the human host
epigenome and gene regulation. We will investigate this possibility through ectopic expression of M.FnI in human
CRC cell lines and pre-cancer organoid models to delineate its nucleomodulin potential (Aim 2). Finally, we seek
to develop chemical probes specific for M.FnI to aid in authenticating it as a therapeutic target in CRC prevention
and progression (Aim 3). While we focus here on a single pathogen and single disease, successful completion
of these aims will provide fundamental knowledge on the role of microbial epigenetic systems in tumor colonizing
microbes. Further, this work has potential to reveal a hidden paradigm of host microbe-epigenetic crosstalk
underlying the oncogenic process in bacterial-colonized, hypermethylated tumors. As such, if our core
hypothesis is true, this work could have a far-reaching impact beyond CRC."
10979258,"Project Summary
Cisplatin is one of the most widely used and most potent chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatment, but
it is also notorious for side effects in normal tissues and organs, especially kidneys. Cisplatin induces
acute kidney injury (AKI) within days of exposure, which may progress into chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Persistent inflammation is a key feature of, and contributes critically to, AKI-CKD transition, but
its molecular basis remains largely unknown. The goal of this application is to delineate the mechanism
of persistent renal inflammation during CKD development after cisplatin exposure. NF-kB is a central
player in inflammation by transactivating pro-inflammatory genes. In preliminary studies, we
demonstrated a continuous NF-kB activation in post-cisplatin kidneys, which was associated with
persistent renal inflammation, fibrosis and decline of renal function. JSH-23, an inhibitor of NF-kB,
suppressed inflammation and CKD development, supporting a pathogenic role of NF-kB. Interestingly,
similar protective effects were shown by 5-aza, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) and
DNA methylation. Remarkably, inhibition of NF-kB with JSH-23 attenuated DNMT expression in post-
cisplatin kidneys, while inhibition of DNMT with 5-aza decreased NF-kB activation, suggesting a novel,
reciprocal regulation between NF-kB and DNMT. Mechanistically, our preliminary results suggest that
NF-kB may transactivate DNMT by binding to its gene promotor and, conversely, DNMT may up-
regulate NF-kB by methylating and repressing PDLIM2, an E3 ligase for ubiquitination and degradation
of the key NF-kB protein p65. We therefore hypothesize that cisplatin treatment leads to the activation
of NF-kB in renal tubular cells, which transcriptionally induces DNMT. Upon induction, DNMT provide a
positive feedback mechanism for NF-kB signaling by methylating and repressing PDLIM2. The
reciprocal regulation between NF-kB and DNMT promotes persistent inflammation in post-cisplatin
kidneys for the development of CKD. Therapeutically, inhibitors of NF-kB or DNMT may protect kidneys,
while enhancing the chemotherapy effects of cisplatin in tumors. To test this hypothesis, we will verify
the roles of NF-kB and DNMT in persistent inflammation and CKD development in post-cisplatin
kidneys, elucidate the reciprocal regulation between NF-kB and DNMT after cisplatin exposure, and
test the hypothesis that inhibitors of NF-kB or DNMT may attenuate renal inflammation and CKD while
enhancing the chemotherapy effect of cisplatin in tumor-bearing animals. Completion of the research
will gain significant new insights into the mechanisms of chronic renal inflammation and CKD following
cisplatin chemotherapy. Moreover, by targeting NF-kB and DNMT, we may identify novel strategies that
not only protect kidneys in cisplatin treatment but also enhance chemotherapy in tumors."
10979259,"Abstract. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most prevalent cancer among men in the United States and radical
prostatectomy remains one of the three treatment options for these patients. Screening with serum prostate specific antigen
(PSA) allows for 78% of prostate cancers to be diagnosed at the early localized stage, facilitating therapy with radical
prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy. However, ∼ 20% patients present with high-risk PCa, i.e., positive surgical margins
(PSM) discovered after surgery during pathology of resected tissues. These patients with high-grade tumors also have a
high risk of biochemical recurrence (>60%) and will ultimately develop lethal metastatic disease. Surgical approaches to
prostate cancer are also associated with significant morbidity, e.g. incontinence (3-74%) and impotence (30-90%) due to the
close proximity of the prostate gland to critical nerves and muscles. Therefore, there remains an unmet clinical need to
improve surgical techniques for identifying and removing all cancerous tissue without damaging surrounding tissues during
prostatectomy and to prevent relapse.
 The goal of this study is to provide a means to address both unmet needs, i.e., to more completely remove cancers
and at the same time generate an immune response to help prevent local recurrence and metastatic disease. In the proposed
study we will develop a precisely targeted theranostic agent, PSMA-1-Pc413, for both fluorescence guided surgery and
photodynamic therapy (PDT) to effectively treat prostate cancer. The overall approach is to use the highly expressed and
tumor selective prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) biomarker to target a highly fluorescent and potent
photosensitizer, Pc4, to prostate cancer tumors. Following IV injection and recognition of the PSMA receptor on prostate
cancer cells, PSMA-1-Pc413 will be used for fluorescence image guided surgery to remove the PCa from the flank of mice.
Following excision, the surgical field will be irradiated with light to stimulate PDT to remove any non-visible or non-
resectable cancerous cells. Furthermore, PDT may stimulate a local and even systemic immune response limiting local
recurrence and metastatic disease. We will first test our hypothesis in immune competent syngeneic mouse prostate cancer
models. Since efficacy trials in mice are not always predictive of human results, we will also test the approach in an
orthotopic canine prostate cancer model; dog pathology and physiology of prostate cancer is very similar to humans and
dogs are often used in drug development trials. After probe injection, PDT will be performed and the canine prostate gland
and any extra-glandular cancer tissues will be resected. Correlation of the probe to cancerous tissues and the impact of PDT
on cancer and surrounding normal tissues will be assessed using histopathology. Targeting and PDT studies in dogs will
substantially encourage the potential to use this agent in dogs with spontaneous forming prostate cancers (beyond the scope
of these studies) and clinical translation of the developed agent. Our innovative, combined theranostic approach, if
successful, will significantly alter the way prostatectomies are performed in the future by: 1)increasing surgical efficacy;
2) prolonging progression-free survival; and 3) decreasing morbidity. No such approach has been reported for PCa."

The calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) links calcium dysregulation and the amyloidogenic pathway
to cognitive dysfunction and tau pathology in AD. Calcium dysregulation occurs in many cell types during
Alzheimer’s disease. One potential source of dysregulated calcium during AD is L-type calcium channels
(LTCCs). We have found that LTCC antagonists can reduce endo-lysosomal dysfunction around amyloid
plaques during Alzheimer’s disease and can ameliorate microglia dysregulation during chronic
neuroinflammation. There is significant crosstalk between these two pathways, suggesting that LTCC
antagonists can target both microglia and neurons, mediating complementary and age-dependent
neuroprotection during AD pathology. Notably, the non-brain-penetrant LTCC antagonist amlodipine is
associated with reduced risk for AD neuropathology and cognitive deficits, suggesting a role for brain-periphery
crosstalk contributing to LTCC antagonist mediated neuroprotection during AD pathology. The overall goal of
our proposed research is to determine how LTCC antagonists may mediate their neuroprotective effects in the
context of amyloid pathology. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the contribution of neuronal Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 LTCCs
to endo-lysosomal dysfunction during amyloid pathology using conditional neuron-specific knockout mice. In Aim
2, we will evaluate the contributions of microglial Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 LTCCs to endo-lysosomal dysfunction
during amyloid pathology using microglia-specific conditional knockout mice. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the
peripheral contribution of LTCC antagonists to neuroprotection during AD pathology using brain-penetrant and
non-brain-penetrant LTCC antagonists. Overall, these studies will enhance our current understanding of LTCCs
as mediators of calcium dysregulation during AD pathology and the beneficial role of LTCC antagonists on
different neural cells and peripheral contributions. In turn, understanding which LTCC subunits to target and how
to best target lays the groundwork for future clinical trials repurposing LTCC antagonists for AD and other
neurodegenerative disorders."
10980210,"Hypertension and heart failure increase risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Autonomic
dysregulation and sympathetic hyperactivity accompany these diseases and trigger lethal arrhythmias.
Interventions that target the central nervous system to inhibit sympathetic outflow have not been effective in
prolonging life in patients, whereas interventions that target the periphery (beta blockers, ganglionectomy)
decrease arrhythmias and prolong life. We hypothesize that central nervous system activity is amplified by post-
ganglionic neurons in cardiovascular disease to enhance cardiac sympathetic transmission which contributes to
pathology. During the previous period of support, we showed that noradrenergic sympathetic neurons have
excitatory cholinergic collateral projections. Preliminary data indicate that hypertension causes a significant
increase in cardiac sympathetic neuron activity. Additional data indicate that cholinergic collateral transmission
is required for the development of hyperactivity in cardiac sympathetic neurons, and that increased collateral
transmission is involved. In Aim 1 we will determine if hypertension increases sympathetic neuron activity
generally, or if the increased activity is limited to cardiac neurons, and if collateral signaling is required. In Aim 2
we will investigate the mechanisms by which cholinergic collateral transmission is elevated in hypertension. New
data from multiple labs implicate satellite glial cells as important regulators of sympathetic neuronal activity. In
Aim 3 we will determine if activation of satellite glial cells in sympathetic ganglia plays a role in sympathetic
hyperactivity in disease. We have assembled a team of accomplished experts, key animal models, and powerful
genetic tools to accomplish these studies. We expect that novel insights and targets for therapeutic intervention
will come from the studies described here, and that this work with have implications for treatment of the many
diseases characterized by high sympathetic activation."

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) with its seven major serotypes, BoNT/A-G, are the causative agents of
neuroparalytic disease botulism. BoNT/A and BoNT/B in particular pose the most serious threats to humans
because of their wide prevalence, high potency, and persistence. Each BoNT molecule has a modular
architecture consisting of a ~50 kDa catalytic light chain (LC) and a ~100 kDa heavy chain (HC). The HC serves
as BoNT’s delivery vehicle, which has high specificity for motor neurons and, following its uptake, subsequently
translocates the LC into the neuronal cytosol. The LC is the warhead of the toxin, which acts in the cytosol as a
sequence-specific protease to cleave soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors
(SNAREs). This blocks the fusion of synaptic vesicles and prevents the release of acetylcholine at
neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), resulting in paralysis of the affected muscles and death by asphyxiation in
severe cases. Currently the only available therapeutics for botulism are equine or human antitoxin serum
products that can prevent further intoxication by neutralizing the circulating toxins, but these antibodies have no
effect on the internalized LC that is mainly responsible for BoNT’s neurotoxic effects. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for an effective treatment for post-exposure therapy for botulism patients. Here we strive to develop
a platform for intra-neuronal delivery of nanobodies (aka single-domain antibodies such as camelid VHHs)
targeting the LC to neutralize the toxin inside the intoxicated neurons and accelerate recovery of the paralyzed
muscles. The general principle of our antidote design is to create genetic fusion proteins consisting of three
modules: a LC-inhibiting VHH as the payload, the translocation domain of diphtheria toxin as a delivery module
for cytosolic translocation, and a targeting module for highly specific neuron targeting. We propose two Specific
Aims to explore two different design types. In Aim 1, we will develop antidotes using the receptor-binding domain
of BoNT/A (HcA) as the targeting module for intra-neuronal delivery of VHHs that inhibit the LC proteases of
BoNT/A and BoNT/B, respectively. HcA binds neuron-specific synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2) and is solely
responsible for neuron-targeting of BoNT/A. These fusions proteins will be subjected to comprehensive
biochemical and functional characterization to optimize their designs followed by mouse efficacy studies. In Aim
2, we will develop and characterize novel VHHs that bind SV2 to replace HcA as a neuron-targeting domain for
the antidotes, which will expand the flexibility of this delivery vehicle and also minimize the immunogenicity
concern. We will then test this second type of antidotes for efficacy in animals. Successful completion of this
work will result in the identification of novel antidotes for BoNT/A and BoNT/B that can be further developed as
therapeutics to treat post-exposure botulism. The versatile intra-neuronal delivery platform is amenable for quick
optimization and flexible enough to expand to develop antidotes for other BoNT serotypes, or to selectively
deliver nanobody or other protein therapeutics, including gene editing components, to treat neuronal diseases."

We will address a critical problem in clinical oncology, namely how highly heterogeneous, drug resistant tumor
cell populations develop, and how they can be targeted. Most tumors develop resistance to almost every type
of therapy, including targeted-, radiation-, chemo- or immunotherapy, ultimately leading to cancer deaths. It is
essential to develop novel methods to understand the processes leading to drug resistance under complex in
vivo conditions where stromal and immune elements interact with malignant cells. We will study squamous cell
carcinomas (SCCs), a major contributor to human cancer burden and one of the most common solid tumor
types that arise in a range of tissues including head and neck, lung, esophagus, bladder, and skin. We will use
a well-established multistage, carcinogen-induced, cutaneous SCC mouse model and credential its’
representation of human cancer drug resistance. Mouse cSCCs display many genetic alterations seen in
human SCCs, including mutation of Ras, PI3 Kinase and Notch pathways. The model also incorporates the
critical role played by non-mutagenic tumor promoting factors as cancer drivers. This proposal will build on our
previous work, accessing our extensive in-house mouse tumor genomics and transcriptomics databases. In
Aim 1, we will use single cell analyses of primary papillomas, carcinomas and metastases induced by chemical
carcinogenesis in situ and analyzed before and during chemo- or immunotherapies. We will use our novel
biocomputational Metagene approach to identify rewiring of transcriptomic networks within single tumor cells
after therapy. Single cell analyses, namely scRNAseq, CyTOF, MIBI, and FISH, will be combined with our in-
house developed analytical tools, to identify high plasticity state tumor cell populations enriched or depleted in
response to therapy and their molecular and spatial relationship to other cells and structures within the tumor.
In Aim 2, we will test the fidelity of the chemical carcinogenesis model as a robust representation of human
cSCC biology by undertaking longitudinal validation studies of fresh human cSCC tissue collected before and
during chemo- or immuno-therapy and analyzed using the same technology. In Aim 3, we will empirically test
the function of candidate genes (Metagene components) expressed in the high plasticity state, for their
contribution to drug resistance. CRISPRi/dCas9 and CRISPR/MultiCas12a technology will be used to test gene
activities during drug therapy by single or combinatorial gene knockdown in syngeneic tumor models in vivo.
Our strategy will credential the use of the skin chemical carcinogenesis system to model features of human
cancer drug resistance. The project is responsive to PAR-23-281, as it undertakes cross-species discovery of
the molecular basis for development of drug resistant tumor cells. The knowledge to be gained will contribute
to discovery of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for this drug resistant cell population. Our computational
methodology and our extensive transcriptomic data from hundreds of tissue and tumor samples will be shared
with the Oncology Models Forum NCIP Hub."
10981027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism of catastrophic mutational processes that drive
very rapid evolution of cancer genomes. One of these processes is chromothripsis, which involves massive
chromosome rearrangement of only one or a few chromosomes and occurs within a single cell division. My group
identified a general mechanism that explains chromothripsis. Using single cell genomics technology developed
in my laboratory (Look-Seq), we discovered that chromothripsis originates from cancer-associated aberrations
of the nucleus called micronuclei or chromosome bridges (Fig. 1, Research Strategy). These structures have
fragile nuclear envelopes that undergo spontaneous rupture, which exposes the enclosed chromosome to the
interphase cytoplasm where it undergoes a first wave of extensive DNA breakage. When the cell with the
damaged chromosome enters mitosis, this chromosome undergoes a second wave of DNA fragmentation,
coincident with a burst of mitotic DNA replication on the damaged chromosome. After the cell exits mitosis and
divides, the chromosome fragments can be segregated to one daughter cell, or the fragments can be distributed
between both daughters. Reincorporation of these fragments into daughter cell nuclei results in the formation
nuclear bodies similar, if not identical to, previously described, but poorly understood, nuclear bodies called
53BP1 bodies. Chromosome fragments in these nuclear bodies are ligated to generate chromothripsis. In
addition to generating chromothripsis, we recently discovered that chromosomes in these nuclear bodies are
subjected to chromatin and transcriptional alterations that can be heritable over many generations, suggesting
that chromosomal instability is inherently linked to instability of transcriptional states.
 Despite this recent progress, many fundamental questions about the mechanism of chromothripsis
remain unclear and will be addressed in this proposal. The mechanism of chromosome fragmentation, both in
interphase and in mitosis, remains poorly understood. The 53BP1 body response is one of the least well
understood aspects of the DNA damage response in human cells. 53BP1 bodies are proposed to protect the
genome, but this has never been directly demonstrated. 53BP1 bodies accumulate DNA end joining factors,
undergo delayed DNA replication and undergo transcriptional suppression—all by unclear mechanisms and with
unclear consequences for the genome. Because of approaches we developed, including our single cell genomics
methods, we are in a unique position to attack these fundamental problems. In addition to our work on
chromothripsis, we will also exploit the technologies we developed to address the mechanism of another poorly
understood, catastrophic mutational process, common in cancer, called chromoplexy. A comprehensive
understanding of both these mutational processes is essential to understand cancer initiation and pathogenesis
and how these events vary in different cell and tumor types."
10981028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Massive amounts of genomic data are currently being generated, providing unprecedented opportunities for
biomedical researchers to characterize various biological components and processes. In order to utilize these
data to make new biological discoveries and improve human health, accurate models and scalable computational
tools need to be developed to facilitate analysis and interpretation. The central objective of this project is to
address this challenge by developing more realistic probabilistic models, scalable algorithms, and user-friendly
software tools to enable the biomedical research community to better harness large genomic data. Many prob-
lems in genomics rely on computational methods for inferring genealogical information from large sequence data
and interpreting the reconstructed trees. In this application, we propose to make significant strides towards im-
proving this line of research by developing a suite of robust and scalable algorithms for probabilistic models of
molecular evolution and genealogical inference across multiple timescales. We will achieve our goal by carrying
out the following specific aims: 1) A fundamental problem in statistical analysis of molecular evolution is estimat-
ing model parameters, for which maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is typically employed. Unfortunately, MLE
is a computationally expensive task, in some cases prohibitively so. In Aim 1, we will tackle this problem by
combining a novel MLE framework and modern optimization techniques to develop a broadly applicable
computational method that achieves several orders of magnitude speedup in MLE for general models of
molecular evolution. The ability to estimate model parameters at unprecedented speed will transform the way
that phylogenetic analysis is performed and enable the community to consider more complex, realistic models
than previously possible. We will apply our tools to improve phylogenetic inference for two clinically important
superfamilies of membrane proteins in humans, namely G protein-coupled receptors and Solute carrier trans-
porters. 2) Because of meiotic recombination, the genetic variability within humans cannot be represented by a
single tree. Instead, there are millions of different trees across the genome, where each position in the genome
will tend to have its own tree that differs only minimally from the trees in nearby sites. The collection of all these
trees, and the set of recombination points creating new trees, is represented by the Ancestral Recombination
Graph (ARG), which has a number of applications in human genetics. Despite substantial recent progress on
reconstructing ARGs, however, current methods are either too slow to scale up to large data sets, or they do not
sample ARGs accurately from the correct posterior distribution. In Aim 2, we will develop a new computational
method to improve ARG sampling. We will test the method extensively on simulated data, develop a number of
applications, and generate genome-wide ARGs for several human data sets to facilitate biological discoveries. 3)
Applications of genealogical inference methods have been rapidly growing in single-cell genomics. In particular,
advances in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technologies have enabled lineage tracing for thousands of cells in
vivo, and the problem of reconstructing trees from such data has received considerable attention recently. In
Aim 3, we will develop scalable algorithms to reconstruct time-resolved single-cell trees for thousands of
cells sampled at multiple time points. We will also develop a novel statistical method grounded in rigorous the-
ory to improve tree-based fitness inference. We will apply the methods developed here to study cancer evolution
as well as B cell affinity maturation in germinal centers."

Risk-taking is a critical component of adolescence, yet maladaptive or unhealthy risk-taking during this
developmental period is associated with significant adolescent morbidity and mortality. While research has
linked early-life environmental exposures to maladaptive neurobehavioral phenotypes, little is known about the
developmental trajectories that contribute to risk-taking. Because brain development is dynamic and nonlinear
throughout adolescence, research needs to assess phenotypic developmental trajectories over time rather
than at a single timepoint—however, such research is challenging, time-intensive, and costly. We can
overcome these challenges with our Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth, Environment and Social
Stressors (PROGRESS) cohort, which has collected longitudinal data on metal exposures as well as neural
and behavioral outcomes from pregnancy through childhood and into adolescence. In our first grant cycle, we
linked reconstructed early-life metal exposure data from our novel tooth biomarker with a single timepoint of
multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and neuropsychological assessments to demonstrate
that a mixture of lead, manganese, and zinc exposure at 6–9 postnatal months increased internalizing
behaviors and impacted neural activity in brain areas subserving emotional processing in preadolescent
children. Increased internalizing problems in childhood may increase the risk for maladaptive risk-taking
behaviors in adolescence. Thus, we hypothesize that early-life exposure to neuroactive metals may impact the
trajectory of brain and behavioral development related to risk-taking. In this first renewal application, we
propose to extend our study in the PROGRESS cohort to include longitudinal assessments of brain structure
and function, allowing us to investigate the impact of early-life metal exposures on developmental trajectories
of adolescent risk-taking behaviors. We propose an accelerated longitudinal design to shorten the time needed
to assess neurodevelopmental trajectories compared to a traditional longitudinal cohort. Our design leverages
existing baseline multi-modal MRI and performative assessments of risk-taking collected in the first cycle (ages
8–14) and adds follow-up of these assessments in the new cycle. We also will enroll new PROGRESS
participants (ages 16–22), allowing us to assess phenotypic trajectories from age 8–22 years—thus covering
all of adolescence. For all participants, we will collect self-reported assessments of risk-taking behavior in
adolescence. This renewal builds on our prior cross-sectional and prospective findings by creating a lifecourse
study of adolescent developmental trajectories of brain structure/function and risk-taking spanning more than
20 years in a single grant cycle. Our approach will serve as a model for future studies of early-life environment
and adolescent health, an understudied life stage representing the transition into adulthood. We will determine
critical windows for early-life metal exposures on adolescent developmental trajectories of risk-taking, which
are key to applying interventions at the appropriate age to promote optimal development and improved health."
10981093,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD4+ T cells (TCD4) orchestrate adaptive immune responses to infectious agents and cancers and instigate most
autoimmune diseases. Thus, greater mechanistic insight into the drivers of TCD4 activation will be broadly bene-
ficial. TCD4 are stimulated by antigen-derived peptides (“epitopes”) displayed at the surfaces of antigen-presenting
cells (APCs) in combination with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules. By convention,
peptide display entails internalization and proteolysis of extracellular antigen, loading of the resultant peptides
onto MHCII in the late endosome, and transit of peptide:MHCII (p:MHCII) complexes to the cell surface. In truth,
p:MHCII production is far more complex. The classical route is made up of many distinct pathways, and there
are 3 multifaceted, nonclassical routes: 1) a recycling route: antigens that unfold in the early endosome are
captured by MHCII in that compartment. 2) an endogenous network: antigens located to the APC cytoplasm,
typically through biosynthesis, are converted to p:MHCII via an array of intracellular pathways, and 3) an “indi-
rect” route: material from an infected non-APC is transferred to an uninfected APC. Despite their obscurity, these
non-classical routes can play essential roles in TCD4 activation. Poor mechanistic understanding of all 4 routes,
even the classical, has precluded their incorporation into many models of adaptive immunity or strategies to
modulate TCD4+ responses. Here we propose to transform the MHCII processing and presentation landscape by
testing the hypotheses that: (A) the degree to which cellular components contribute to epitope production and
display is highly variable - from far reaching (impacting many epitopes) to highly focused (impacting only one
epitope or a small set), and (B) processing and presentation pathways within one route or within functionally
adjacent routes (e.g., classical and recycling), share more cellular components than disparate routes (e.g., clas-
sical and endogenous). Drawing from our influenza (flu) antigen system, we have carried out an siRNA-based
high throughput screen (HTS) for proteins involved in generation of one classical (“S1”) and one endogenous
(“NA79”) epitope. Consistent with our hypothesis, hits are largely non-overlapping. Aim 1 of this project is to
solidify this screen by validating key hits. Aim 2 is to expand the landscape by screening 6 flu epitopes that
comprehensively encompass the 4 major routes. Instead of an siRNA screen, in Aim 2 we will use genome-wide
CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and select hits via FACS using a panel of T cell receptor-like antibodies in concert with
single-cell illumina sequencing. Outcomes from both aims will contribute to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis that
will substantially revise the MHCII processing and presentation landscape with respect to both scope and reso-
lution. Outcomes will launch many new avenues of investigation that explore: a) additional epitopes from flu and
other pathogens, b) mechanisms underlying key hits and pathways, c) the impact on TCD4 activation of knocking
out, in vivo, high priority hits, and d) development of therapeutics (e.g., small molecules) to enhance vaccine
efficacy and anti-cancer immunity, and to diminish autoimmune diseases."

The stratum corneum contains unique species of the sphingolipid ceramide and that unique constellation is
essential for formation of the epidermal permeability barrier and is altered in diseases such as atopic dermatitis.
These ceramides are composed of fatty acids linked to a set of sphingoid backbones. The species of sphingoid
backbones found in the epidermis are highly unique. The premise of this application is that the unique
sphingoid backbones found in the epidermis are essential for formation of a fully functioning
permeability barrier and that alterations to that composition contributes to compromised barrier function
in skin diseases. These concepts have not previously been experimentally addressed. The sphingoid
backbones are generated by the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) complex, a hetero-oligomeric enzyme
composed of four subunits. Three of these four subunits have alternate isoforms. Depending on which isoforms
are expressed, SPT generates distinct sphingoid backbones. Our preliminary data demonstrates that during
keratinocyte differentiation there is a dramatic increase in the SPT subunits expected to generate the unique
sphingoid bases of the epidermis. The ability to genetically alter the expression of the epidermal SPT subunits
provides an avenue to directly test the role of epidermal-specific sphingoid backbones in development of the
epidermal permeability barrier. We will utilize both organoid culture systems and the intact animal to test this
concept. Additionally, we will utilize an animal model of atopic dermatitis to examine the role of these SPT
subunits in the etiology of that disease. Through collaboration between experts in keratinocyte biology and skin
disorders (Dr. Paller and the Northwestern SBDRC) and lipidomics/the SPT complex (Drs. Wattenberg and
Cowart at Virginia Commonwealth), we will fill key gaps in understanding the epidermal lipid barrier through this
regulatory mechanism"
10981176,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a complex polygenic disorder, encompassing a spectrum of
positive and negative clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits that vary considerably between individuals.
Unfortunately, progress in understanding the etiology and pathophysiology is hindered by the lack of appropriate
models that adequately capture both the complex and heterogeneous nature of the genetic risk and the diversity
of the phenotypic manifestations. The advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology provides an
important new experimental platform to study the cellular and circuit function of human cells that contain an
individual’s full complement of genomic risk alleles. Thus, the door is now opened to developing improved in
vitro models that can enhance understanding in an integrated context, relating patient genomes and cellular
variables to their clinical and cognitive phenotypes. In this proposal, we describe our established, systematic,
and quantitative hiPSC pipeline that models the cumulative cellular effects of common SCZ genetic risk variants
by selecting patient and control lines (CON) based on their SCZ polygenic risk score (PRS). hiPSC lines were
generated from fibroblast donors in our NIMH Clinical Sibling Study, for which extensive clinical and cognitive
data are available. On our 2D platform, we performed unbiased phenotypic discovery on cortical neurons derived
from 13 high PRS SCZ hiPSCs and 15 low PRS CON hiPSCs using an array of physiological assays, done blind
to patient information. From these experiments we have published a report with multiple preliminary associations
between electrophysiological variables and patient clinical and cognitive phenotypes. Here, we propose to
replicate and expand on these findings using an entirely new set of hIPSCs (17 SCZ, 15 CON), again chosen
based on PRS. In Aim 1, using our 2D platform, we propose to replicate, expand, and examine in depth
case/control phenotypes and associations between cellular measures and clinical and cognitive features
observed in SCZ patients. In Aim 2, we propose to use 3D cortical organoids to confirm our prior voltage gated
sodium channel (VGSC) and GABAergic phenotypes and to discover novel molecular and cellular alterations in
early cortical development by performing a multi-modal set of assays that includes single cell electrophysiology,
bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics on our entire set of SCZ and CON hIPSCs
(N=60). Together, the work in these Aims is designed to identify cellular phenotypes related to the etiology,
pathophysiology, and symptomatology of schizophrenia, with the goal of identifying therapeutic targets and
enabling precision psychiatry."
10981178,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lupus nephritis (LN) is the most common severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
Disease progression is associated with tubulointerstitial hypoxia and metabolic dysfunction, capillary
rarefaction, accumulation of immune infiltrates and fibrosis. Complete remission rates in patients with LN are
<50% (and often <30%) even in the setting of rigorous clinical trials and responses cannot currently be
predicted by clinical and histologic features at initial biopsy. We currently have insufficient understanding of
why clinical outcomes do not always correlate with histologic changes, why only some patients with interstitial
kidney inflammation progress to ESRD, and how to predict responses to therapeutic intervention.
We do not know which human in situ disease mechanisms are manifest in which murine LN models. Indeed,
murine models have often failed to predict clinical utility in human LN. While no murine model provides a
holistic picture of human LN, this would not be expected as the human disease is very heterogeneous. Rather,
we propose an overall hypothesis that specific pathogenic human LN immune states are quantitatively
replicated in select murine models of lupus nephritis. We will test this hypothesis using innovative high-
dimensional confocal microscopy and AI-driven analysis of both human and murine LN tissue. These studies
will be complemented by directed mechanistic studies in relevant LN murine models.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To define prognostically important in situ autoimmune states in human LN. We hypothesize that
specific in situ immunological architectures, associated with specific CD4- T cell and myeloid cell populations,
will define therapy-resistant, progressive renal disease.
Aim 2. Quantify in situ T cell states in murine LN models and their relationship to human LN. We
hypothesize that in situ T cell architectures implicated in progressive human LN will be approximated in select
murine LN models and that these areas reflect sites of pathogenic CD8+ T cell clonal expansion.
Aim 3: To quantify in situ myeloid immune states in murine LN models and their relationship to human
LN. We hypothesize that in situ myeloid cell architectures implicated in progressive human LN will be identified
in mouse models, and that only some myeloid subsets will be associated with tissue injury and fibrosis. This
information will inform complementary functional studies in mice."
10980826,"Temporal patterning is an evolutionarily conserved means to generate the proper complement of neurons during
brain development. Our long-term goals are to resolve temporal fate specification in the Drosophila brain and
discern which mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved in mammals. Temporal patterning has been best studied
in Drosophila, where temporal features of the cycling neural stem cells (NSC) are passed to the progeny. Despite
decades of study on temporal pattering of the mouse neocortex, the mechanisms that drive temporal progression
of cortical fates are not well understood. The Drosophila model system is a proven source for fundamental gene
and mechanistic discovery and many aspects of brain development and NSC behavior are conserved between
flies and mammals. Thus, investigating Drosophila temporal factors is a fitting strategy to discover candidates
for mammalian study. Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding proteins (IMP) are expressed in fly and mouse
NSCs in a descending temporal gradient. By binding mRNA targets and regulating their protein levels, Drosophila
Imp (together with another RNA binding protein, Syp) controls both neuronal temporal fate and the cycling and
termination of NSCs. Mouse IMP1 and IMP2 similarly regulate temporal changes in NSC behavior. Nonetheless,
a role for IMPs in neuronal temporal fating has not been explored in the mouse. The objectives of this proposal
are to 1) utilize the Drosophila model system to gain deeper insight into temporal fating and 2) explore roles for
mouse IMPs in neocortical neuronal temporal fating. This proposal combines discovery science and targeted
experiments to achieve an in-depth understanding of fating mechanisms at the single-cell level. Specific Aim 1
will uncover the detailed molecular, genetic signatures of a diverse Drosophila neuronal lineage. The
developmental code of neurons as they undergo temporal-fate specification will be matched with the resulting
terminal code. Specific Aim 2 will explore how Imp/Syp temporal gradients and periodic Notch signaling
coordinate to produce terminal neuron fates. Aims 1 & 2 exploit innovative, sophisticated genetic tools to target
a specific neuronal lineage for single-cell RNAseq, reporter-based birth-order analysis, spatial transcriptomics,
and targeted genetic perturbations. Specific Aim 3 will explore mouse IMPs in neocortical neuronal temporal
fating and test the hypothesis that, like Drosophila Imp, mouse IMPs control temporal fate. Aim 3 exploits spatial
transcriptomics to elucidate temporal changes occurring in neocortical progenitors. To test the functions of IMPs,
in-utero electroporation will allow TEMPO (a tool that tracks lineage and birth order) and IMP overexpression
constructs to be expressed in the neocortical progenitors. Our results will help lay the foundation to tailor
neurogenesis, critical for cell-replacement therapies to treat neurological disorders. Moreover, as IMPs are
implicated in other stem cells and in cancer, the findings may be broadly applicable."
10988592,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neuronal dysfunction underlies the general pathophysiological mechanisms related to heavy alcohol use
and development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Homeostatic glia-neuron communications underlie the
development and functional maintenance of the central nervous system (CNS). Alcohol-induced neuropathology
has been demonstrated to involve dysregulation of glia-neuron interactions, but the exact molecular and cellular
mechanisms remain elusive. Evidence suggests involvement of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, in
CNS communication and the pathogenesis of CNS diseases. Recent studies point to the exosome as a potential
mediator of astrocyte-neuron interactions. It has been shown that exosomes released from astrocytes are
internalized by neurons and also that neuronal activity-dependent exosome secretion from astrocytes may
modulate the efficacy of synaptic transmission and the preservation of axonal health. These suggest an important
contribution of astrocyte-neuron communication by exosomes to neuronal integrity. Moreover, the utility of brain-
derived plasma exosomes as a biomarker for neuropathology has been demonstrated. Thus, it has been shown
that genetic information associated with brain tumor or brain injury is detectable in plasma/serum microvesicles
of patients, suggesting that brain-derived exosomes may serve as cargo for diagnostic biomarkers. Astrocytic
exosomes may also play significant roles in the pathophysiology of AUD, but it is unknown if heavy alcohol
exposure affects the biogenesis of astrocytic exosomes, their trafficking and distribution, and further biological
functions. This R21 exploratory grant application is designed to address our hypothesis that chronic alcohol
affects the biogenesis and distribution of astrocyte-derived exosomes and their molecular components thereby
affecting astrocyte-neuron communication. We propose two Specific Aims to achieve our immediate goals: (1)
develop an in vivo model of astrocyte-derived exosome tracking with which to profile the astrocyte-derived
exosomal RNAs, and (2) determine the effect of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure on the
biogenesis, distribution, and RNA signatures of astrocyte-derived exosomes. By achieving these aims, we will
be able to determine the potential roles of astrocyte exosomes in transducing the effects of chronic alcohol
exposure onto neuronal cells. We will also gain insight into the potential utility of brain-origin exosomes and their
contents as biomarkers of alcohol dependence-related abnormalities. This reporter model may then be used to
study the mechanisms of astrocyte involvement in various CNS homeostatic functions and numerous other
pathological conditions."

This R21 is in response to FOA PA-20-195/ NOT-HL-21-024: development of new ideas and first-generation
prototypes for therapeutics and nanotechnologies as applied to the cardiovascular mission areas of the NHLBI.
Our proposed research aims to design and test novel small antibodies (12-15 kDa) called nanobodies.
Nanobodies are unique monoclonal antibodies, found in camelid species, that have the specific advantage of
being able to enter the cell. The developed nanobodies will target a specific protein interaction inside smooth
muscle cells (SMC) with the aim of disrupting their pathological proliferation. We have identified connexin 43
(Cx43)-cyclin E interactions as a significant contributor to pathological SMC proliferation and cardiovascular
disease progression. This interaction occurs inside the cell, so therapeutic approaches to disrupting interactions
are very limited. The focus of the research will be to develop Cx43-cyclin E targeting nanobodies as potential
therapeutics in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
Acquired injuries are associated with pathological proliferation. For example, stent placement surgery damages
the blood vessel wall, leading to rapid SMC proliferation, a hallmark of stent failure. SMC proliferation thickens
the blood vessel walls, called neointima formation, eventually blocking the artery. Current therapies target
general proliferation pathways using adapted chemotherapeutic agents. However, these non-specific agents kill
healthy cells as well, reducing vascular healing and leading to long-term failure rates of 25%. By targeting the
mediators of only pathological proliferation in SMC, it may be possible to stop neointima formation and promote
the healthy recovery of endothelial cells on the blood vessel wall.
In large vessels, Cx43 is expressed only in SMC, and the target site is a post-translational modification that we
have shown does not alter Cx43 channel conduction. Preliminary data in this proposal suggest the Cx43-cyclin
E interactions occur in models of human SMC proliferation. We have generated novel disruptor peptides
replicating the Cx43-cyclin E binding site and provide data that they can limit neointima in mice and humans. As
peptides are of limited therapeutic use, due to in vivo stability issues, we have adapted these peptides for
injection into llama, generating nanobodies. The project objectives are to define the best binding nanobodies
from screening, alter these to enable cell entry, validate functions in vitro, and demonstrate the translatable
nature in mouse and human models of neointima.
This research is specifically responsive to NHLBI-NOT-HL-21-024. Our study aims to produce prototype
nanotechnologies (nanobodies) that significantly improve cellular therapeutics (intracellular targets), and
address gaps in the repair and regeneration of vascular disease states. Doing this will achieve more effective
therapies for future translation and our data will feed into future NHLBI Catalyze Program applications."
10989143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this application is to bring a trachea patch to the market for treatment of pediatric
tracheal stenosis, or narrowing of the airway, which left untreated can be a life-threatening condition. Currently,
otolaryngologists have only two major options for treating tracheal stenosis. One is a complex surgical procedure
known as slide tracheoplasty that few surgeons in the country are qualified to perform. The other is to cut and
splay the trachea holding it open using a graft of rib cartilage. Both are difficult, time-consuming procedures with
potential complications. We have an issued U.S. patent on the trachea patch biomaterial that overcomes the five
major technical hurdles required to replace rib cartilage grafting: 1) mechanical integrity, 2) suturable, 3)
resorbable, 4) air-tight, and 5) off-the-shelf. There is currently nothing on the market remotely resembling the
idea of a synthetic patch for tracheal stenosis. While the academic tissue engineering community has focused
primarily on regenerating an entire trachea with highly complex strategies, arguably leading to technology in
search of an application, we have focused instead on identifying a specific patient indication with an unmet need
and designed a technology to fill that void.
 The overall hypothesis is that mimicking the wound healing environment using reinforced electrospun
scaffolds with gradient presentation of biological factors will maintain tracheal patency and regenerate cartilage-
like tissue comparable to healthy tracheas. Two specific aims are proposed to determine the most attractive
growth factor loading for mimicking specific stages of wound healing. Aim 1 will refine growth factor loading by
evaluating multiple compositions in a subcutaneous model. The final device composition will then be evaluated
in a capstone in vivo rabbit tracheal defect study in Aim 2.
 Compared to rib cartilage grafting, our trachea patch holds the following advantages: 1) No surgery to remove
rib tissue, saving operating room time and cost, and eliminating potential complication/infection and morbidity at
the rib site (attractive to patients and insurance companies), 2) Easy to use, as it is “plug and play” for surgeons
who perform rib cartilage grafting (attractive to surgeons), 3) The gradient design has the potential to improve
functionality and accelerate regeneration, promoting vascularization, macrophage recruitment, and directed
matrix synthesis. For several reasons, we focus initial clinical translation on the pediatric population with
laryngotracheal stenosis. In the simplest terms, our goal is to fix tracheas for young children around the world
with narrowed airways to help them survive and breathe normally again."

Video Disease Activity Index: a video measure to monitor rheumatoid arthritis in telemedicine
Project Summary/Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a degenerative autoimmune condition of the joints that is treated with medications
that suppress the immune system. Medications must be regularly adjusted according to disease activity, based
on clinical examination. Telemedicine has gained a key role in rheumatology during the COVID-19 pandemic,
with rheumatologists amending treatment based on patient reports of disease activity and signs of swelling
observed on video. However, numerous studies have proven that telemedicine may miss critical information that
affects how disease activity is treated. The proposed project aims to improve the accuracy of assessing disease
activity and functioning in RA during telemedicine visits by using laptops and smartphone standard cameras.
This will also help reduce the costs associated with objective evaluation for RA. The overall goal of this
exploratory and developmental R21 project is to assess technical feasibility and patient usability of camera-
based remote assessment system. The first aim is to develop a web-based system that leverages computer
vision to quantify joint range of motion and joint thickness as an indication of joint swelling in RA to determine
disease activity. We also aim to modify and improve the current method of assessing functional impairment by
incorporating isometric grip strength using an in-house squeezable ball. During this first phase, the vision-based
system and the squeezable ball will be validated on young and older adults through comparison with gold-
standard techniques (e.g., motion capture). The second aim is to evaluate a new scoring system called the Video
Disease Activity Index (VDAI) in a cross-sectional feasibility investigation with RA patients (n = 50). The VDAI
scoring system will be produced by quantifying joint range of motion and joint thickness to determine the number
of swollen joints. This will provide a measure of disease activity that aligns with the clinically endorsed Clinical
Disease Activity Index (CDAI), which will be measured by a rheumatologist in the clinic. Two tests of the VDAI
will be conducted: one with a researcher present to evaluate the system's sensitivity and reliability against clinical
examination (CDAI), and another where RA patients will use the web-based application alone, while still in the
clinic, with a vision-based feedback algorithm to perform the required activities. As the VDAI and CDAI are on
the same scale (0–24), the study will use joint-level power calculations to permit standard limits of agreement
analysis between the two measures (e.g., Bland-Altman). The correlation between grip strength and functional
questionnaire scores will also be evaluated using Pearson's tests. These analyses will provide a robust
evaluation of the sensitivity and reliability of the VDAI system and its potential to improve the accuracy of
assessing disease activity and functioning in RA during telemedicine visits. By leveraging ubiquitous cameras,
this investigation has the potential to significantly increase the quality of disease activity and functioning in RA
during telemedicine visits."

The gene that encodes the NMDA-GluN2B subunit (GRIN2B) is one of the top 10 genes implicated by de novo,
gene-disrupting single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Multiple mouse models of
ASD risk genes show abnormalities in the dopamine system, suggesting this as one potential point of
convergence. Some neuroimaging and clinical data also point to the dopamine system in ASD, including the use
of medications targeting the dopamine system and triggering of repetitive behaviors following dopamine agonists.
In prior work, we had found that increased or decreased expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter
EAAT3, which modulates NMDA-GluN2B receptor function, reciprocally impacts dopaminergic neuron firing,
striatal dopamine release, and resulting repetitive behavior. We now have evidence that pharmacological
inhibition of NMDA-GluN2B attenuates dopaminergic neuron firing and downstream behavior. Despite published
and preliminary data suggesting that NMDA receptors containing GluN2B play a critical role in modulating
dopaminergic neuron function, this has not been assessed using genetic mouse models of GluN2B disruption.
We therefore propose to use a conditional Cre/lox strategy to assess the impact of GluN2B loss in dopaminergic
neurons. We hypothesize that diminished signaling at NMDA-GluN2B receptors will decrease dopaminergic
neuron firing, resulting in diminished baseline and evoked dopamine release, and downstream alterations in
impulsive behavior and habitual learning. We will test this hypothesis by comparing mice with heterozygous loss
of GluN2B in dopaminergic neurons with littermate controls. Importantly, we will primarily focus on heterozygous
loss to parallel the human de novo variant findings; however, we will also study homozygous Grin2b conditional
knockout animals to better reveal the biological impact of GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in dopaminergic
neurons, as well as the potential for developmental compensation. We will pursue our hypothesis using in vivo
extracellular single-unit recordings from optogenetically identified dopaminergic neurons, fiber photometry
monitoring of dopamine release in the striatum, and operant-based behavioral tasks assessing impulsive
responding and habitual learning. Our results will illuminate NMDA-GluN2B mechanisms of dopaminergic neuron
regulation, as well as the relationship with downstream behavior. They may also reveal opportunities for precision
medicine interventions, both for GRIN2B-related developmental disorders and for other subgroups with altered
dopaminergic function."
10988727,"Phospholipase C b (PLCb) enzymes increase intracellular calcium in response to diverse extracellular signals,
regulating numerous processes including cell proliferation and survival. Dysregulation of their expression or
activity contributes to pathophysiological conditions such as heart disease, cancer, and addiction. All four PLCb
isoforms bind to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane where they hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol-4,5-
bisphosphate (PIP2). They are activated via direct interactions with the heterotrimeric G proteins Gaq, and in
most cases, by Gbg. All PLCb isozymes have two elements that profoundly autoinhibit PIP2 hydrolysis: a lid that
blocks access to the active site, and a helix in the proximal C-terminal domain that binds to the catalytic core. G
protein binding and recruitment of the lipase to a membrane surface has been proposed to displace all the
autoinhibitory elements, resulting in activation. However, recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures
of G protein–PLCb3 complexes bound to model membranes reveal that this is model is insufficient. In these
structures, the catalytic core fails to engage the membrane and the active site remains blocked. Thus, the
mechanism of activation and the molecular basis of isoform-specific responses to G proteins remain unresolved.
Furthermore, G proteins may also increase PLCb activity by altering their behavior on the membrane surface,
an aspect that cannot be assessed via structures or cell-based assays alone. To address these gaps, we propose
a synergistic and interdisciplinary combination of functional and structural studies, cell-based assays, and single
molecule microscopy to investigate the structure and regulation of the four PLCb isoforms. In Aim 1, we use
functional analyses to test hypotheses derived from new structures of PLCb complexes. We will also determine
cryo-EM reconstructions of the four PLCb isoforms in solution, and a subset in complex with G proteins on model
membranes known to promote activity. Aim 2 utilizes bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and
signaling assays to monitor the location and disposition of PLCb isoforms within a cell and measure the kinetics
of G protein-dependent activation in response to receptor stimulation. In Aim 3, single molecule total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy will be used to dissect the contributions of the PLCb regulatory
domains, PIP2, and G proteins to the kinetic behavior of individual lipase molecules on model membranes. Strong
preliminary data is included in support of each aim. Our work will not only reveal new mechanistic insights in
PLCb regulation but allow us to identify regulatory features unique to each isozyme that could be targeted by
novel selective chemical probes."

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an urgent public health threat. Of greatest concern are epidemic
CRKP lineages that have acquired multidrug resistance, rendering standard therapies ineffective. While new drugs are
available, resistance has already been reported. Alarmingly, our preliminary analysis of resistance to novel β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combination therapies in regional isolates collected from long-term acute care hospitals in 2014-2015
revealed that 14% of epidemic lineage CRKP sequence type (ST258) isolates were already resistant before the drugs were
on the market. Maintaining the long-term efficacy of antibiotics is hindered by a limited understanding of the patient
populations, clinical practices, and bacterial features that will ultimately drive the emergence and spread of resistance to
newly approved antibiotics. This proposal’s objective is to identify patient and bacterial associated with the emergence
and spread of resistance to two novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor therapies: meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-
relebactam. The central hypothesis is that there is an interaction between strain background and clinical exposures that
influence the propensity for resistance to emerge and subsequently spread via clonal expansion or plasmid transfer. This
hypothesis will be tested using the following aims: (1) determine the potential for analysis of resistance drivers identified
before the clinical deployment of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination therapies to inform patterns of resistance
emergence and spread once they begin being utilized and (2) determine the influence of genetic background on the
emergence of resistance to β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination therapies. To accomplish these aims, the PI will
leverage two isolate collections: (1) 390 clinical CRKP ST258 isolates collected from 12 California long-term acute care
hospitals in 2014-15 and (2) ~1500 CRKP isolates collected from a 2021-23 follow-up study in the same facilities.
Clinical data collection, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing were performed on each isolate.
Alongside bioinformatic analyses, experimental methods will be employed to validate resistance-associated genotypes and
evaluate the contribution of genetic background on resistance emergence. The results from this proposal will improve our
understanding of the patient and bacterial features that drive the evolution and spread of resistance to β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combination therapies. Our results have the potential to inform surveillance efforts, infection
prevention interventions, and the stewardship of antibiotics to slow the development of resistance. This proposal also
serves as an excellent training program for the development of the critical thinking and multidisciplinary research skills
needed to advance the PI’s pursuit of becoming an independent scientist who develops innovative solutions to combat
antibiotic resistance by applying advanced genomic methods, data analysis methods, and wet lab experimentation to
identify patient and bacterial features that drive the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance."

Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that is critical to public health and a top cause of infectious
death worldwide. To infect humans and cause disease, S. aureus is dependent on the availability of nutrient
metals, including zinc (Zn). In response to infection, host factors including the S100 protein calprotectin (CP) act
as effectors of nutritional immunity and sequester nutrient metals. Vertebrate proteins of the COG0523 family
have been identified as bona-fide Zn metallochaperones that equip downstream metalloprotein effectors with Zn
ions. COG0523s in bacteria are predicted to perform a similar role in maintaining cellular metal homeostasis and
supporting cellular function, particularly in the setting of Zn starvation. This proposal aims to evaluate S. aureus
COG0523 orthologs crzA and zigA, define the impact that these genes have on pathogenesis, and elucidate
their role in Zn transfer to predicted interaction partners. Preliminary data suggest that crzA and zigA are
regulated by Zn via the transcriptional repressor Zur, that high confidence interaction partners exist for both CrzA
and ZigA, and that loss of either COG0523s or predicted binding partners increases sensitivity to DNA damage.
This phenotype is pronounced in crzA and zigA mutants exposed to both Zn stress and specific DNA damage.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that S. aureus COG0523s transfer Zn to metalloproteins
involved in DNA damage repair in a Zn- and GTP-dependent manner and that this process is important
to S. aureus pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, biochemical, genetic, and microbiological techniques will
be used to define a model of CrzA and ZigA function in S. aureus. In Aim 1, I will define the mechanism for
interaction between COG0523s and their clients and evaluate how metal, candidate clients, and GTP/GDP affect
the dynamics of CrzA and ZigA Zn transfer. To accomplish this, I will express and purify COG0523s and their
clients, and define the function and required co-factors of ZigA and CrzA by co-immunoprecipitation, client-
specific biochemical assays, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). In Aim 2, I will test
the hypothesis that COG0523s regulate client activity and affect S. aureus DNA maintenance and that conserved
COG0523 Walker and CXCC motifs are required for ZigA and CrzA function in S. aureus. I will conduct growth
curves and survival assays in the presence of DNA damaging agents and in bone-marrow derived macrophages
to elucidate the impact of Zn, DNA damage, COG0523s, and the metal/GTP-binding motifs of these proteins on
S. aureus growth and mutagenesis. In Aim 3, I will test the hypothesis that CrzA and ZigA enable S. aureus to
circumvent host-imposed Zn restriction. Manipulation of Zn-handling both in the host and pathogen will
demonstrate the impact of COG0523s on infection and increase the rigor of our approach. Taken together, the
proposed work will have broad implications for the study of S. aureus pathogenesis. This work has the potential
to establish CrzA and ZigA as the first experimentally confirmed bacterial Zn-metallochaperones and continue
to develop an understanding of the role of nutritional immunity in therapeutics and clinical practice."

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecological cancer, in part because there is no widely used screening test and 80% of
tumors are diagnosed at a late stage. Though ovarian cancer screening has the poten>al to diagnose tumors at early
stages when pa>ent outcomes are far be?er (90% survival for stage I cancer vs. <20% for stage III/IV), recent screening
trials of protein biomarkers have failed to show a mortality beneﬁt. This has highlighted three main challenges in ovarian
cancer screening: (1) Avoiding false posi>ve results leading to unnecessary procedures in a disease with low popula>on
prevalence, (2) Achieving high enough sensi>vity to be a clinically useful test, and (3) Ensuring accessibility and pa>ent
compliance with screening. Much of my early PhD work, and work in my mentor’s lab, has pioneered high performance
blood tests that use cell-free DNA fragmenta>on pa?erns to detect cancer. These fragmentomic assays can detect subtle
changes to DNA shed from tumor cells even using low-coverage sequencing of <1mL of blood, and their non-invasive
nature makes them accessible and appealing to pa>ents. Given the cri7cal clinical need, the overarching goal of my
work is to advance our understanding of ovarian tumorigenesis and develop an accessible, high-performance liquid
biopsy for ovarian cancer screening. A limita>on of current liquid biopsies is that they don’t incorporate informa>on
from the ~50% of the genome comprising repeat elements, which have long been implicated in carcinogenesis but have
been diﬃcult to study due to incomplete genome references and technical genome alignment challenges. In preliminary
work, I show a novel approach I developed that allows the study of repeat landscapes in short-read sequencing and that
has iden>ﬁed over 800 new elements not previously implicated in cancer. The ability to use this approach in short-read
sequencing opens the door to studying repeat landscapes in cell-free DNA, where most fragments are 150-180bp in
length. I propose three speciﬁc aims: In Aim 1, I will expand this approach to develop novel bioinforma>cs approaches
enabling the study of repeat elements in cell-free DNA. In Aim 2, I will develop and test sensi>ve and speciﬁc cell-free
DNA liquid biopsies for ovarian cancer. In Aim 3, I will characterize genomic changes to repeat elements during ovarian
tumorigenesis, from normal >ssue to pre-cancerous lesion to tumor. Successful execu7on of these aims has the
poten7al to advance our understanding of the role of the so-called “dark genome” in ovarian tumorigenesis, change
the paradigm for liquid biopsies by illumina7ng cancer-related changes to repeat elements, and apply these

10978509,"Emerging research implicates gait dysfunction as a preclinical marker of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias. Our team has been in the vanguard of gait and cognition research. To advance the field, we will
employ innovative gait phenotyping and multidisciplinary team science approaches to discover novel risk and
protective mechanisms for gait dysfunction in the context of dementias. The aging population can be classified
into slow-movers (1SD below ‘robust’ mean speed for age and sex), usual-movers ( 1SD) and fast-movers
(≥1SD). We will employ novel multi-modal neuroscience, neurophysiological, and biological approaches to
discover novel risk mechanisms in the earliest stages of gait and cognitive decline (preceding slow mover stage).
We introduce the original concept of ‘super-movers’: non-demented and non-disabled fast movers, 80 years
and older with gait speed of adults 30 years younger. We posit that this unique group of oldest fast movers are
enriched in unique brain and biological profiles that help maintain exceptional gait into their 9th decade, and will
provide a window into protective mechanisms. We hypothesize that the interplay between pathological and
resilience mechanisms in aging results in structural, functional, and neurophysiological brain changes leading to
the emergence of gait dysfunction as a preclinical marker of dementia.
Aim 1: Identify protective brain mechanisms linked to gait in super-movers. We predict that compared to
usual movers (≥80y): 1A: Super-movers will have better brain health on multi-modal measures. 1B: Super-
movers will show differential activation over premotor and sensorimotor cortex sustained across the gait cycle in
response to complex gait demands. 1C: As some (but not all) fast-movers will age into super-movers, we will
compare neuroimaging and mobile EEG measures in fast-movers vs usual/slow movers in all participants (≥65y).
Aim 2. Establish neurophysiological mechanisms underlying gait and cognitive decline in aging. In the
overall sample (≥65y): 2A: Baseline gait related mobile EEG activation patterns will predict longitudinal declines
in cognition as well as combined cognitive-motor decline. 2B: Poor multisensory integration at baseline will
predict longitudinal declines in cognition and Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome.
Aim 3. Determine pathological mechanisms underlying gait and cognitive decline in aging. We predict
among adults ≥65y: 3A: Slow movers will have more, and faster movers will have less neurodegenerative
pathology (p-Tau, Aß-42 and NFL) than usual movers. 3B: Higher levels of neurodegenerative pathology at
baseline will predict cognitive decline and Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome.
This proposal is highly responsive to RFA-AG-24-041. Successfully attaining our aims will inform the use of gait
as an early ‘cognitive’ biomarker, identify protective mechanisms that promote resilience to Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias, and guide the design of early interventions to prevent cognitive decline."
10999376,"Heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent problem and particularly so
amongst an aging Veterans population. It accounts for over half of all patients with heart failure. While there
have been considerable advances in understanding the mechanisms and treatment of patients with heart
failure when ejection fraction is reduced, there have been few advances in understanding the mechanisms or
treatment of HFpEF. From a clinical standpoint, the prevalence of comorbid conditions such as obesity,
diabetes, COPD and hypertension in these patients has led to the inflammatory hypothesis where HFpEF is
also associated with coronary microvascular dysfunction. Nevertheless, the causal importance of inflammation
and impaired coronary flow regulation in the development of the HFpEF phenotype remain unclear. Advances
in understanding mechanisms of HFpEF have been limited by the lack of suitable animal models of disease.
At present, the only available models involve uncontrolled chronic hypertension with severe left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH). While these have informed our understanding of hypertensive heart disease and diastolic
dysfunction over the last 50 years, they may not be directly relevant to the majority of HFpEF patients. First,
most patients with HFpEF have controlled or only mild systolic hypertension and LVH is frequently absent.
Second, in contrast to patients with HFpEF, hypertensive heart disease progresses to systolic dysfunction
(HFrEF). Thus, how the development of reduced left ventricular compliance typical of many HFpEF patients
develops in the absence of sustained hypertension remains an enigma. Completed work during the previous
funding period has resulted in the development of a large animal model of the HFpEF cardiac phenotype
produced by repetitive brief LV pressure overload. This simulates the labile systolic hypertension typical of
patients with reduced systemic arterial compliance accompanying aging where HFpEF is particularly prevalent.
Initially, brief pressure overload is characterized by stretch-induced “stunning” with focal myocyte apoptosis
and troponin I release occurring in the absence of myocardial ischemia. Within 2-weeks, reduced LV
compliance, myocyte loss and myocyte cellular hypertrophy develop with a prominent increase in interstitial
fibrosis. This is accompanied by concentric inward LV remodeling yet, like most patients with HFpEF, the
absence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy or uncontrolled hypertension at rest. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that stretch-induced myocyte injury associated with repetitive labile systolic hypertension and
preload elevation leads to chronic troponin I release and a myocardial inflammatory response that is initiated
by proinflammatory macrophages. This leads to myocyte loss and to the development of interstitial fibrosis.
This progression can be prevented by interventions that attenuate fibrosis and the macrophage response to
chronic myocyte injury. We will use the swine HFpEF model to translate three promising antifibrotic
interventions that are supported by mechanistic studies in rodent models of cardiac fibrosis but not translated
to a large animal model of disease. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the development of the HFpEF
phenotype can be prevented by limiting the recruitment of proinflammatory macrophages following repetitive
pressure overload-induced myocyte injury with micelles loaded with a CCR2 inhibitor. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that N-Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Proline (Ac-SDKP), a peptide inhibitor of fibrosis, can reverse
established interstitial fibrosis and improve left ventricular compliance by attenuating the macrophage
response to myocyte injury. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that intracoronary cardiosphere derived cells can
promote macrophage polarization to a reparative phenotype and improve LV compliance by reversing fibrosis
as well promoting myocyte proliferation. Our long-term objective is to improve the care of Veterans with heart
failure by developing a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to HFpEF and identifying novel
targeted treatments that can prevent or reverse interstitial fibrosis to increase LV compliance."

11000563,"Parent Award - Abstract
Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
which aims at restoring a healthy cellular proteome. Dysregulation of the UPR is key to diseases, e.g. neurodegeneration.
For this central role, the UPR forms a network of processes, involving complex transcription, translation, and RNA and
protein degradation changes. For example, while the UPR shuts down global translation, it activates specific response
genes, such as the transcription factor ATF4. Our goal is to investigate this response network.
We have investigated this network from several angles: profiling the dynamics of the mammalian UPR, we identified
regulatory signatures for hundreds of genes. We discovered a translation regulatory element in ATF4 whose role in
translation induction of the gene under stress had been overlooked. The element consists of a start and stop codon and
stalls ribosomes. We discovered start-stops in hundreds of genes enriched for signaling molecules. In addition, we profiled
protein modifications, e.g. ubiquitination, in response to stress. Further, we began to compare the UPR in two closely
related motor neurons with differential stress-sensitivity that is consistent with their role in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS): stress-sensitive spinal motor neurons die early during ALS, while more stress-resistant cranial motor neurons
survive until late stages of the disease. We identified molecular signatures, e.g. in the proteasome, that can explain the
motor neurons’ differential stress sensitivity. Doing so, we created tools and resources for integrative analysis.
In the next five years, we will address three major questions that arise from these findings: i) How does the cell, in
general, induce stress response genes while general translation is halted? ii) What are the roles of protein modifications in
the UPR? and iii) How do translation, protein modifications, and other pathways form an efficient and robust response
network that restores proteome health upon stress? Specifically, we will investigate the role of start-stops and other
elements in translation regulation of DROSHA and RAD23B, which function in the miRNA pathway and DNA damage
repair, respectively, but also link to the ER stress response. Using a gain-of-function construct, we will deconvolute the
mechanism of start-stop function and identify regulators of ribosome stalling that affect transcript localization, stability,
and downstream re-initiation. We will complement these analyses with large-scale assessment of ribosome scanning and
initiation, changes in transcript stability and in proteins bound to mRNAs in response to stress. A second research avenue
will investigate protein ufmylation, a ubiquitin-like protein modification linked to the UPR and ER maintenance, but also
to translation and the DNA damage response. We previously found that Ufl1, a key ufmylation gene, expresses different
isoforms in cranial and spinal motor neurons, and our proposed work will investigate the impact of differential Ufl1
expression on the UPR in the two motor neurons. Complementing these analyses, we will attempt to identify novel and
neuron type specific ufmylation targets and investigate their links to translation regulation, ribosome quality control, and
DNA damage repair. The work will exploit our expertise in systems-scale and targeted analysis to understand new
properties of the proteostasis network."

Sensing and processing information through signaling cascades is an essential part of cellular life. A few
signaling cascades such as the MAP kinase and Hippo pathways are ubiquitous among eukaryotes yet
perform different functions across organisms. Although these pathways are well-studied, how they evolve to
take on new functions and adapt to new inputs remains poorly understood. The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a
Ras-like GTPase signaling cascade and yeast homolog of the Hippo pathway, provides a unique opportunity to
study this question. In the MEN, the same core signaling components operate in distinct manners under
different developmental trajectories. During yeast mitosis which occurs through an asymmetric cell division
called budding, the MEN is scaffolded onto the spindle pole bodies (SPB, the yeast equivalent of centrosomes)
and responds to spindle position through its GTPase Tem1. During meiosis, where budding is suppressed and
thus no need to sense spindle position, MEN signaling is no longer organized at the SPBs, and it is unclear
whether Tem1 is still required for MEN activation and what signal it may respond to. To understand the
adaptation of the MEN under distinct cellular contexts, this proposal will test the hypothesis that this adaptation
is enabled partially by different activation mechanisms of the MEN kinase Cdc15, the effector kinase of Tem1,
between mitosis and meiosis (Aim 1). In contrast to the drastic change in spatial organization of the MEN core
components between mitosis and meiosis, the effector protein of the MEN, the phosphatase Cdc14, remains
sequestered in the nucleolus prior to activation both in mitosis and meiosis. In fact, this nucleolar localization of
Cdc14 is conserved from yeast to human. Sequestration of Cdc14 in the nucleolus could function either 1) to
ensure tight inhibition of Cdc14’s phosphatase activity prior to activation or 2) to localize Cdc14 to
dephosphorylate specific substrates in the nucleolus. To uncover the selection pressure that maintains this
conserved nucleolar localization of Cdc14, this proposal will examine these two hypotheses by sequestering
Cdc14 elsewhere in the cell and characterize the consequences first in yeast and then in mammalian cells
(Aim 2). The experiments within both aims will be initiated during the K99 phase which also includes training of
the candidate on new experimental systems such as yeast meiosis and mammalian cells, as well as the
development and implementation of quantitative microscopy, proximity labeling and optogenetics. Furthermore,
the candidate has assembled an outstanding mentor team to both advise her scientifically to facilitate progress
of the project and prepare her for the transition to an independent investigator. Together, this proposal will
create a strong foundation for an independent research career in understanding the evolution/adaptation and
spatial organization of cellular signaling."
10996880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alpha-1 antitrypsin disease (AATD) is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, which encodes AAT protein.
AAT is produced in liver and delivered via serum to lungs, where it inhibits neutrophil elastase. The most common
AATD allele—called PI*Z—is a G-to-A mutation that produces a dysfunctional misfolded protein, Z-AAT, that
aggregates in hepatocytes, which can cause liver disease; reduced serum AAT causes pulmonary emphysema.
Currently, the only approved therapy for AATD emphysema is costly, weekly infusions of purified AAT for life.
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair (HDR) can correct PI*Z in the liver and partially restore serum
AAT levels in an AATD mouse model. Yet, HDR is limited by the need to deliver a DNA repair template, its
inefficiency in non- and slow-dividing cells, and its generation of genotoxic double-strand breaks. By contrast,
CRISPR-mediated adenine base editors (ABEs) support precise editing without requiring a DNA donor or double-
strand breaks. ABE consists of adenine deaminase (TadA) conjugated to Cas9 nickase. When directed by a
guide RNA to a specific sequence, ABE deaminates adenine in a defined editing window. The resulting inosine
is read as guanosine, thereby converting A to G. Thus, ABE is a good candidate for PI*Z correction.
Preliminary evidence shows that viral delivery of a compact ABE, utilizing an evolved Cas9 nickase derived from
Neisseria meningitidis (eNme2-C ABE), to PI*Z transgenic mice leads to efficient editing of PI*Z in hepatocytes
to significantly reduce liver disease. Yet, eNme2-C ABE deaminates not only the target adenine but also
“bystander” adenines in the designated editing window, leading to mutations of unknown consequence.
Moreover, the level of base editing needed to rescue lung disease is undetermined.
This project seeks to optimize ABE precision for PI*Z correction and assess the therapeutic potential of ABE in
treating emphysema in a mouse model of AATD. Aim 1 will characterize ABE off-target and bystander edits for
PI*Z correction. TadA variants with distinct editing windows have been developed, including ABE8e and ABE9e.
eNme2-C ABE8e and ABE9e edit both the target adenine and bystander adenines at the PI*Z target locus in
PI*Z reporter cells. Off-target editing events by each variant will be detected and validated in PI*Z reporter cells
and liver cells by deep sequencing and RNA sequencing. Bystander alleles generated by each variant will be
identified, then in vitro approaches will be used to analyze the secretion and activity of each AAT bystander
mutant. Aim 2 will characterize ABE-mediated PI*Z correction and lung function in AAT-null PI*Z mice, which
exhibit both lung and liver disease. eNme-2 ABE will be delivered by AAV to AAT-null PI*Z mice, and pulmonary
mechanics will be measured over 10 weeks. At endpoint, serum, liver, and lung tissue will be collected to
measure serum AAT level, PI*Z correction and hepatocyte AAT aggregates, and alveolar morphometry.
This proposal will inform the development of base editing strategies to treat AATD and provide the fellow with
training in therapeutic genome editing and genetic disease biology."

Meiosis is a specialized set of cell divisions that produce haploid gametes. During meiosis I (MI) in females,
bipolar spindle formation and positioning within the oocyte must be regulated tightly to ensure faithful
chromosome segregation and proper genome inheritance. In somatic mitotic cells, bipolar spindle formation and
positioning rely on a centrosome pair, each of which contains two centrioles. Interestingly, meiotic oocytes lack
centrioles and, hence, lack classic centrosomes. Meiotic oocytes, instead, contain numerous microtubule (MT)
organizing centers (MTOCs) that are organized, by largely unknown mechanisms, to establish two spindle poles
(polar MTOCs). The traditional view was that, in mammalian oocytes, MTs (and their associated proteins) are
the only cytoskeletal components responsible for organizing such MTOC spindles. However, recent data suggest
that F-actin is also involved in spindle bipolarity regulation. How F-actin interacts with MTs to regulate polar
MTOC organization during MI represents a critical gap in our understanding of how the meiotic spindle is built.
We recently identified a novel, functionally different, class of MTOCs (mcMTOCs) and found that spindle
maintenance at the oocyte center is regulated by two opposing forces (mcMTOC-mediated MTs vs. F-actin). We
also recently observed that ~50% of spindles are not assembled centrally. To date, such peripheral spindle
assembly was unobservable owing to technical limitations associated with spindle fluorescence (i.e. live
imaging). To circumvent this, we generated a Cep192-eGfp reporter mouse model enabling spindle tracking
wherever it is assembled. Strikingly, peripheral spindle formation is typically followed by spindle migration
towards the center – a previously undocumented phenomenon. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
regulating this corrective developmental event represents a major gap in our knowledge of meiotic spindle
spatiotemporal regulation during MI. This proposal lays the foundations for our long-term goal: To understand
how two critical events during MI — bipolar spindle assembly and positioning — are regulated, in the absence
of centrioles, to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. To do so, we will utilize state-of-the-art approaches,
including transgenic mouse models, genetic constructs, laser ablation, and cutting-edge imaging, to tackle three
critical goals: (i) determine how F-actin interacts with MTs to organize polar MTOCs during bipolar spindle
building, (ii) establish the mechanism(s) by which the peripheral acentriolar spindle migrates to the oocyte center,
and (iii) determine whether differences in biochemical compositions of mcMTOCs vs. polar MTOCs underlie their
functional differences. Given that chromosome segregation errors (very common during MI) lead to aneuploidy,
the leading genetic cause of developmental disorders and miscarriage, these studies have the potential to
significantly advance our basic understanding of two fundamental processes — spindle formation and positioning
— during MI whilst simultaneously shedding light on why MI is notoriously error prone."

10997953,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Memory loss is a devastating symptom of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Memories are thought to be stored in the brain in neural ensembles called engrams, which are traces of
individual memories that are active during both memory encoding and memory retrieval. In a mouse model of
AD, prior research has shown that the APP/PS1 mice are impaired in retrieval of a contextual fear conditioning
(CFC) memory, and this memory deficit is paralleled by impaired engram reactivation. While past studies have
identified and manipulated these ensembles in the context of AD, researchers have not fully elucidated the
molecular changes occurring in engram cells that contribute to this memory deficit. This proposal addresses this
gap in knowledge by determining the gene expression landscape that distinguishes engram cells from non-
engram cells in the HPC, and how this landscape changes with age and AD. These experiments will use cutting-
edge labeling techniques and single-nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to test the hypothesis that engram
cells show transcriptional signatures unique from those of cells active during memory encoding or retrieval alone,
that these signatures are required for proper engram reactivation, and that they are lost in APP/PS1 mice. Aim
1A uses an intersectional transgenic approach with the activity-dependent labeling mouse line ArcCreERT2 x
Sun1-GFP to indelibly tag nuclei of cells active during memory encoding and retrieval. HPC tissue will be
dissociated, sorted via flow-activated nuclear sorting (FANS), and profiled via snRNA-seq to compare encoding-
active, retrieval-active, and reactivated engram cells. In Aim 1B, select highly differentially enhanced genes
(DEGs) in reactivated engram cells will be validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), then artificially
knocked down via virally induced RNA interference (RNAi) to test whether these key targets are necessary for
engram reactivation and subsequent memory retrieval. Lastly, Aim 2 uses a similar tagging strategy and
behavioral paradigm in 6-month-old APP/PS1 (+ or -) x ArcCreERT2 x Sun1-GFP mice to determine how engram
transcriptomes diverge between control and disease states. This experiment tests the hypothesis that engrams
of APP/PS1 mice lack the signatures that define engrams in age-matched controls, underlying their deficit in
memory performance. Successful completion of these aims will illuminate with unprecedented resolution how
memories are stored in the HPC and how they change with AD, unveiling a suite of key molecular players that
are critical to memory storage and may serve as therapeutic targets. The training plan of this proposal includes
several novel technical skills, including stereotaxic surgery, in situ hybridization, RNAi-mediated knockdown, and
advanced bioinformatic analysis. Additionally, it describes myriad professional scientific skills such as
grantsmanship, scientific writing, and oral presentation that will be fostered in the richly collaborative research
environment of this application, setting the stage for a successful independent research career."

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and deadly form of pancreatic cancer with a poor
prognosis and low survival rate. Despite advances in treatment and diagnosis, PDAC is still the third leading
cause of cancer-related deaths, often diagnosed at late stages, and resistant to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy due to its inherent tumor heterogeneity. The exact cause of PDAC is unknown, but several environmental
and genetic risk factors have been identified. Moreover, mutations in genes such as KRAS, TP53, SMAD4, and
CDKN2A have been reported as genetic drivers of PDAC progression. In recent studies, epigenetic changes
have been shown to play a significant role in the development and progression of PDAC, but the underlying
mediators that contribute to these alterations are largely unknown.
Previous studies have established a connection between mitochondrial proteins and epigenetic modifications,
contributing to the progression of tumorigenesis. Our research team has used mouse orthotopic tumor models
to recently report that the mitochondrial protein, GOT2 (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), supports the
development of PDAC by exerting an immunosuppressive effect within the tumor microenvironment. Currently,
it remains unknown whether GOT2 contributes to the metastasis of PDAC, however, preliminary data seems to
suggest that GOT2 may play a role in modifying the epigenetic landscape in mouse PDAC cell line models. To
investigate this further, we have meticulously designed our methods to successfully carry out the aims outlined
in this proposal, utilizing in vivo mouse tumor models, as well as ChIP- and ATAC-seq experiments in conjunction
with bioinformatics approaches. The overall goal of our proposed aims is to gain a better understanding of the
mechanisms contributing the epigenetic dysregulation in pancreatic cancer and metastasis. We hypothesize
that GOT2 is pro-metastatic and plays a role in reprogramming the epigenetic landscape, which leads to
transcriptional profiles that facilitate the metastasis of PDAC. By revealing this new epigenetic role for
GOT2, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the transcriptional and epigenetic programs that enhance the
plasticity of tumor cells and drive the progression of PDAC. Ultimately, this will provide new opportunities for the
development of more effective treatments to address the increasing medical and societal burdens of pancreatic
cancer."
10999105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with a median
survival of 6.2 months for patients who present with metastatic disease. Up to 10% of GEA patients show
activation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGFR2) signaling due to FGFR2 gene amplification and/or fusion. FGFR2
overexpression is associated with lower response to chemotherapy and a poor prognosis. Clinical trials targeting
FGFR2 in GEA include the use of both antibodies and small molecules. A Phase 2 clinical trial combining
standard-of-care chemotherapy with an anti-FGFR2 monoclonal antibody (bemarituzumab) showed meaningful
but not yet statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival. Recent clinical data demonstrate
significant improvements in progression-free survival in GEA patients treated with an FGFR2 selective tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI), RLY4008. However, resistance to TKIs emerge rapidly and we have identified on-target
resistance mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain in GEA patients who progress on RLY4008. One approach to
overcome TKI resistance mutations is through combination therapy with antibody drug conjugates (ADC).
Standard antibodies, including bemarituzumab, do not significantly attenuate FGFR2 signaling likely due to the
bivalent nature of the antibodies that maintain receptor dimers in the absence of ligand. Biparatopic antibodies
(BipAbs) however, recognize two distinct epitopes on the same protein leading to enhanced pharmacologic
activity. Thus, we created 15 BipAbs from combinations of 6 FGFR2 antibodies targeting the extracellular domain
of FGFR2 which is retained in both FGFR2 amplified and FGFR2 fusion-positive GEA. Two of our FGFR2 BipAbs
show markedly increased avidity, receptor degradation mediated by lysosomal pathways, and in vitro and in vivo
activity against FGFR2-fusions. Furthermore, initial experiments show these two bipAbs are active in GEA cell
lines as ADCs. The significant clinical activity of the ADC trastuzumab-deruxtecan in HER2+ GEA suggests that
this linker-payload combination targeting FGFR2 should be tested in FGFR2+ GEA. In this proposal, we will 1)
utilize novel immune competent mouse models of FGFR2 amplified GEA or FGFR2 fusion-positive GEA to:
develop and test highly efficacious FGFR2 bipAbs and antibody-drug conjugates alone or in combination with
immune checkpoint inhibitors, and 2) develop combination strategies with FGFR2 bipAbs and TKIs by
understanding the mechanisms of resistance to FGFR2 selective TKI. We hypothesize that both approaches will
lead to enhanced responses to FGFR2 TKIs and delay the emergence of TKI resistance."

The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and apply novel proteogenomic approaches to identify
therapeutic vulnerabilities of chromosome 3 rearranged myeloid leukemias. Chromosome 3 inversions or
transversions (inv3/t(3;3)) leukemias result in aberrant overexpression of oncogenic transcription factor MECOM
(MDS1 and EVI1 complex locus, specifically a truncated isoform EVI1) and decreased expression of tumor
suppressor GATA2. Inv3/t(3;3) abnormal myeloid leukemia patients have no targeted precision therapies as they
are resistant to standard of care regimens like Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), and so experience dismal 5-
year survival rates of <5%. Consequently, there is an unmet need for new approaches to therapeutically target
inv3/t(3;3)-driven leukemias. Canonically, MECOM is critical in regulating hematopoiesis, however, alternative
transcripts of MECOM drive oncogenesis when overexpressed as a result of chromosomal rearrangements. In
addition to oncogenic MECOM, I hypothesize that the inv3/t(3;3) abnormality leads to the production of additional
leukemia specific proteoforms that contribute to the aggressive nature of this disease. Here, I will test this
hypothesis by comparing inv3/t(3;3) positive and negative myeloid leukemia cell lines with healthy cord-blood
derived hematopoietic progenitor cells using novel proteogenomic approaches. To test this hypothesis I will:
identify inv3/t(3;3) specific genes by combining RNA-Seq and bulk proteomics (Aim 1), utilize PacBio long read
sequencing with proteomics to identify novel protein coding alternative transcripts (Aim 2) and capture inv3/t(3;3)
unique post-translational processes through utilization of my N-terminal proteomics methodology termed N-
SPyCE (neo-N-terminal SP3 Pyridine Carboxaldehyde Enrichment) (Aim 3). In exciting preliminary data, I have
already identified several key candidates for MECOM-affected genes, including HLA-DPB1, IL16, SPP1, CD74
and ALDH1A1. Pathway analysis of my bulk proteomic data revealed a striking correlation between inv3/t(3;3)
harboring cells and increased cathepsin-mediated protease activity. I hypothesize that there are specific
cathepsin cleaved substrates that are specific effectors of inv3/t(3;3) biology. Overall, this project proposes to
utilize proteogenomics to detect disease specific transcript isoforms, to validate their expression at the protein
level and to investigate leukemia specific proteoforms as therapeutically relevant."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The rate of dementia increases almost
exponentially with age – thus, the prevalence of AD has rapidly grown with the global life expectancy. Dementia
is detrimental to an individual’s standard of life, economic status, and psychological condition. Studies have
shown that certain neuropsychiatric disorders can promote the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
to AD. These disorders include anxiety, depression, and apathy. Depression and apathy have been studied in
this population; however, anxiety has largely been neglected. Understanding the mechanism, brain connectivity,
and response heterogeneity involved in anxiety interventions is pivotal in developing individualized interventions
for anxiety-paired MCI or AD.
This proposal broadly aims to understand the mechanism of anxiety interventions in an older adult population.
The objective of this work is to compare the neural changes that occur in individuals who respond and do not
respond to the non-invasive intervention. This work focuses on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for
anxiety intervention. Prior works have shown that tDCS shows promise to treat anxiety when paired with cognitive

intervention. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to identify the regions of interest (ROIs)
that are responsible for neurophysiological changes in tDCS-paired cognitive training for anxiety intervention
(Aim 1). We focus on specific brain regions (DLPFC, DMPFC, VLPFC) that have been shown to lead to response
in previous anxiety and dementia studies. Our hypothesis is that these activity in these regions will be positively
correlated to changes in neural function compared to sham. The neuroimaging results will highlight the specific
functional connectivity networks (left or right DLPFC, ACC) in fMRI that are associated with response to cognitive
training and tDCS intervention (Aim 2). Our analysis target specific functional connectivity networks that are
backed by anxiety research. These results will provide insight into the best intervention strategies to yield positive
results to anxiety interventions. All together, these aims will provide crucial insight into anxiety pathways and the
ideal steps for targeted anxiety interventions to prevent AD and related dementia.

A key feature of cocaine use disorder (CUD) is deficits in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core
(NAc). These deficits in dopamine release are concomitant with disruptions in the ability to process non-drug
stimuli and the severity of these deficits correlates with negative treatment outcomes in patients. Understanding
how drug use leads to impaired stimulus processing is critical for both understanding and ultimately treating
individuals suffering from CUD.
To understand how cocaine dysregulates non-drug stimulus processing, we first need to understand
how stimuli evoke dopamine release in healthy animals (Aim 1). Dopamine is often discussed as a reward
or valence signal; however, recent work has clearly demonstrated that in the NAc both appetitive and aversive
stimuli increase dopamine release. These dopamine increases causally control learning in response to non-drug
stimuli. Thus, it is likely that dopamine in the NAc core transmits a saliency signal that notes what is important to
an animal, regardless of whether the stimulus is rewarding or aversive. In the saliency framework, both appetitive
and aversive stimuli would evoke dopamine release from the same axon terminals. However, while both aversive
and appetitive stimuli induce dopamine release in the same brain region as measured with techniques like
voltammetry, microdialysis, and fiber photometry with optical dopamine sensors, these techniques suffer from
poor spatial resolution. It is thus possible that different stimuli cause dopamine release from different pools that
are in the same region, but spatially distinct. In this framework, appetitive and aversive stimuli would evoke
dopamine release in spatially distinct patterns. Aim 1 will utilize in vivo microendoscopic imaging of dopamine
sensors to visualize spatial dopamine release in awake and behaving animals to test the hypothesis that patterns
of dopamine release are spatially distinct in response to appetitive (sucrose) and aversive (quinine) stimuli.
Are cocaine-induced deficits in dopamine release in the NAc core stimulus specific (Aim 2)? Regardless
of whether dopamine elicits distinct spatial patterns depending on the stimulus, it is well established that cocaine
exposure causes deficits in dopamine release in the NAc. It is unclear if these deficits are specific to distinct
stimuli (for example, only for rewards or only for non-drug stimuli) or occur in response to all stimuli. Using in
vivo dopamine sensor imaging with spatial resolution, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that cocaine self-
administration reduces dopamine release in response to appetitive and aversive stimuli to a greater extent than
cocaine associated stimuli. This proposal will complement my current in vivo dopamine neuron electrophysiology
expertise while providing exceptional training in in vivo imaging of dopamine biosensors and the computational
toolkit necessary to analyze complex signaling patterns."

 The circumvallate papilla (CVP) and von Ebner's minor salivary glands (VEG) form a complex at the
posterior midline of the tongue. The epithelial trenches of the CVP contain hundreds of taste buds (TBs) which
each contain taste receptor cells (TRCs) that transduce taste information that is conveyed to the brain. Taste
perception is affected by salivation through tastant dissolution and subsequent clearing from the oral
epithelium. Serous saliva produced by VEG acinar cells is transported through salivary ducts that connect to
the ventral region of the CVP trenches. Cancer patients undergoing therapy often experience dysgeusia or taste
dysfunction, and can experience xerostomia due to reduced salivary gland function. Further, clinical data show
that dysgeusia is detrimental to patient quality of life, potentially leading to poor survival outcomes. Therefore,
understanding the maintenance of the CVP/VEG epithelium will allow the development of therapies to mitigate
the effects of cancer treatments on taste and salivary gland function.
 CVP homeostasis occurs through the proliferation and differentiation of LGR5+ progenitor cells that
generate TRCs in TBs as well as cells of the surrounding keratinized non-taste epithelium that supports TB
structure. Though CVP epithelial renewal has been well characterized, progenitor cells involved in VEG
homeostasis have yet to be identified. However, our lab performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on
murine CVP/VEG epithelium, revealing that CVP and VEG lineages may arise from a common progenitor
population. Differential gene expression analysis reveals SOX9 marks this common progenitor, and
pseudotime analysis suggests SOX9+ progenitors give rise to LGR5+ progenitor cells. Preliminary lineage
tracing and immunostaining of Sox9CreERT2;TdTomato mice shows that SOX9+ cells contribute to CVP TBs and
non-taste epithelium, although this technique did not allow me to assess contributions to VEG. However,
organoids generated from single SOX9+ cells express markers of CVP and VEG, supporting a model where
SOX9+ cells are multipotent CVP/VEG progenitors. Together, these findings lead to my hypothesis that SOX9
marks a basal multipotent stem population that gives rise to CVP and VEG epithelia. To test
this, in Aim 1 I will use genetic barcoding and scRNAseq of SOX9+ progenitors and their progeny to determine
lineage relationships across the CVP/VEG complex. In Aim 2, I will generate organoids from LGR5+-only,
SOX9+-only, and LGR5+/SOX9+ double positive cells using CVP or VEG organoid protocols to assess if LGR5 vs
SOX9 expression restricts CVP and VEG lineage production. Further, I will ablate LGR5+ cells from
heterogenous organoid cultures to determine if single SOX9+ cells are truly multipotent or if they coordinate
with LGR5+ cells to maintain the CVP/VEG complex. Together, these findings will contribute to our
understanding of CVP/VEG homeostasis."

In recent years, adenosine has been identified as an important therapeutic target due to its observed
immunosuppressive effects in the tumor microenvironment. By agonism to adenosine receptors, adenosine
is a broad suppressor of immune function, decreased cytotoxic activity of T cells and NK cells, and increased
differentiation of T cells to T regulatory cells. In the tumor microenvironment adenosine are elevated due to
the overwhelming release of adenosine triphosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, both of which
are degraded to adenosine in the extracellular environment during cancer-associated stress conditions.
Structurally similar 5’methylthioadenosine, and adenosine’s extracellular degradation product inosine are
also observed to stimulate adenosine receptors. Independent of immunomodulatory mechanisms, tumor-
expressed adenosine receptors have been observed to contribute to growth, metastasis, and proliferation of
cancer cells. This effect is less defined compared to the immunosuppressive activities, but has significance
in both solid tumors and post-chemotherapy or radiation models where adenosine and inosine are often
greatly elevated due to surrounding dead or dying cells.
Individual cancer cell lines commonly delete the gene encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase,
responsible for depleting 5’methylthioadenosine, and are separately observed to modulate the expression of
enzymes responsible for producing or degrading adenosine, or expression of adenosine receptors. The
varied and redundant pathways resulting in adenosine receptor stimulation limits the effectiveness of single
receptor agonists or enzymatic inhibitors. For this reason, in Aim 1 I will engineer a stable, high affinity human
methylthioadenosine phosphorylase which substantially degrades both adenosine and
5’methylthioadenosine. Engineering an enzyme with favorable kinetic parameters, selectivity, and stability
will allow for therapeutic characterization. In Aim 2, I will evaluate the in vitro efficacy of the enzyme and
immune-independent mechanism with human cancer cell lines. Finally, in Aim 3 I will perform in vivo analysis
of therapeutic potential. Following toxicology and pharmacologic studies, I will define the therapeutic effect
on a the CT26 colon carcinoma syngeneic murine cancer model. I will use CD4 and CD8 T cell depletion
and tumor immunophenotyping to gain insight into the immunomodulatory mechanism, specifically the
balance of effector versus regulatory lymphocytes."

Shigella are bacterial pathogens that are a major source of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, and globally, a leading
cause of long-term disability and disease in children. Illness necessitates Shigella invade epithelial cells lining
the colon and then spread between the cells of the epithelial monolayer. This type of spread enables bacteria to
avoid immune detection while acquiring nutrients and increasing the size of their replicative niche, thus
intercellular spread is essential for severe disease. To spread, Shigella repurposes the actin cytoskeleton to
acquire actin-based motility within cells. Shigella that move to the plasma membrane deform it into structures
known as protrusions. These protrusions are essential for spread, because they enable bacteria to push into
adjacent, uninfected cells. While these macroscopic steps are known, the molecular mechanisms that drive them
are much less understood. Here, I propose to study the molecular mechanisms for how synaptopodin (Synpo)
promotes Shigella flexneri intercellular spread. Our data demonstrate that Synpo is required for disease caused
by S. flexneri, as it is essential for the bacteria to spread between cells. We show that Synpo enables the
formation of longer actin fibers within the actin tail and enhances the efficiency of protrusion formation. It is
unclear how Synpo promotes these processes, my preliminary data show S. flexneri infection alters the
phosphorylation state of Synpo within defined or predicted protein interaction domains. I hypothesize that the
phosphorylation state of Synpo is altered during infection such that Synpo forms a complex with distinct proteins
during infection, enabling the recruitment and function of these proteins at sites of bacterial protrusion formation
and sites where bacteria polymerize actin. To test aspects of this hypothesis, I propose the following aims: Aim
1. To define whether phosphorylation of Synpo is necessary for S. flexneri intercellular spread. Aim 2. To define
whether Synpo promotes localization of host proteins to S. flexneri during infection. The completion of these
aims is likely to define new mechanisms about how Synpo functions in cells and about how bacteria spread
intercellularly. These approaches will further define the role of post-translational modifications of Synpo, identify
proteins that interact with Synpo, and determine how Synpo is localized to particular positions within the cell.
Further, many pathogens that cause diarrhea require mechanisms similar to Shigella, suggesting that my studies
are likely to yield general insights into how pathogens cause diarrheal disease."

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), the second most common primary liver cancer after hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), is an aggressive malignancy with dismal overall prognosis. While frontline combination of
chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has been a major recent advance in therapy for patients
with unresectable iCCA, there remains an unmet critical need to improve the current median progression free
survival of about 8 months. With data supporting the need for a pre-existing immune response in the tumor for
ICI response, here we propose to add high-dose conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) followed by
intra-tumor injection of autologous dendritic cells (DC) to dual PD-L1 (atezolizumab)/TIGIT (tiragolumab)
blockade to further enhance the immune stimulatory effect. Radiation can induce inflammatory tumor cell death
that can be favorable for tumor neoantigen presentation. Injection of autologous DC after EBRT would be a
novel method of boosting in vivo tumor antigen uptake and presentation to expand tumor-reactive cytotoxic T
cells. We have treated subjects with unresectable liver tumors (HCC and iCCA) in a pilot study with this EBRT
and DC approach with promising response and acceptable toxicity (no grade ≥ 3 toxicity). Three of the 8
subjects had partial response, including an iCCA patient with ongoing response at 48 months. Both emergence
of new T cell receptor (TCR) clones and expansion of existing TCR clones, including clones with tumor
reactive and cytotoxic profile, have been observed, suggesting this combination could enhance tumor reactive
cytotoxic T cell response. However, many of the TCR clones also have early exhaustion signal with
upregulation of multiple checkpoint receptors including PD-L1 and TIGIT. Thus, combining DC injection with
atezolizumab and tiragolumab may help further enhance the cytotoxic functions of these TCR clones. We
hypothesize that combining EBRT followed by intratumor DC injections with atezolizumab and tiragolumab can
improve the PFS for patients with unresectable iCCA and that the effect is mediated by systemic expansion of
a tumor reactive T cell repertoire. We will test the hypothesis through 2 aims. 1) Assess the clinical efficacy
of this combination therapy in a phase II study with a safety run-in phase. PFS will be the primary
endpoint. 2) identify the effect of this novel combination immunotherapy on tumor reactive T cell
repertoire. We will use scRNAseq and TCRseq to identify TCR clonal expansion and transcriptome profile of
the TCR clones in the blood and tumor, with a focus on tumor reactive TCR clones. We will also use
scRNAseq and flow to profile the changes of other immune cells in the tumor and blood. Finally, we will use
imaging cytometry to examine the tumor and immune spatial relationship in the tumor. Our study will not only
identify the clinical activities of this novel combination therapy but also use state-of-the-art technology to
improve our understanding on the mechanism of action and potential resistance to this immunotherapy."

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can result in life-long oral, ocular, and genital infections that lead to
debilitating diseases such as blindness and life-threatening encephalitis. A key aspect of HSV pathogenesis is
the ability of the virus to establish a latent infection in sensory neurons, for which repeated reactivations result
in viral replication and cellular damage and leads to HSV-mediated diseases. Understanding the components
and processes that control latency and reactivation is essential to developing novel and effective therapeutics.
A key viral component in controlling the latency-reactivation cycle is the immediate-early protein of HSV known
as infected cell protein 0 (ICP0). ICP0 is an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase that significantly enhances the expression
of all 3 HSV gene classes required for efficient lytic replication and viral reactivation from latency. Importantly,
the transactivation function of ICP0 is linked to dimerization via its C-terminal domain. Genetic studies indicate
that ICP0's dimerization/C-terminal domain significantly enhances viral replication and pathogenesis in an
animal model of HSV latency and reactivation. Surprisingly, there is very limited information regarding the
mechanisms associated with ICP0 protein-protein interaction/dimerization process and function of ICP0. The
long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the interactions among and between viral factors and to relate
findings from these studies to recurrent herpetic diseases. As an important step in this direction, the X-ray
crystal structure of ICP0 dimers has been solved; this structure of ICP0 dimers is a novel fold, as there are no
structural homologs in the Protein Data Base. The objective of this application to identify mechanisms by which
ICP0 binds to itself to enhance viral transcription. The central hypothesis is that specific C-terminal residues
on ICP0 facilitate its dimerization to stimulate its (own) Ub ligase activity, viral gene expression, and productive
infection. The rationale for these studies is the concept that structural knowledge of ICP0 and its dimer
interface will allow one to understand how this viral protein controls lytic infection and reactivation. To test this
hypothesis the following Specific Aims are proposed - Aim 1: Identify ICP0-ICP0 dimerization contacts that
stimulate HSV gene expression. Aim 2: Determine the contribution of ICP0 dimerization in HSV-1 replication
and pathogenesis. Work from this study is significant and innovative as it will provide the first known molecular
structure of a large functional domain for HSV-1 ICP0, uncover at least one mechanism of ICP0 dimer
formation, and ascertain how ICP0 self-interactions modulate it key activities and pathogenesis. Results from
project can be compared to other herpesviruses that encode orthologs that are functionally similar to ICP0."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects more than 10% of the United States population. AUD is a psychiatric
disorder characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and the emergence of profound negative affective states,
including persistent pain. Alcohol is also known for its analgesic effects, although excessive use facilitates pain
sensitivity (or hyperalgesia) during withdrawal. While chronic pain affects over 20% of the global population
and contributes to the development and severity of both psychiatric illness and AUD, effective pharmacological
treatments for these conditions remain very limited. In recent years, many people have turned to cannabis for
management of chronic pain and various negative emotional symptoms associated with mental illness.
However, there is a significant gap in knowledge regarding the analgesic efficacy of primary cannabis
constituents in the context of alcohol dependence and how use may either mitigate or worsen the risk of
substance use disorders. Specifically, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component
of cannabis, may offer a promising avenue for pain management, a common cause of excessive drinking in
individuals with AUD. From a neurobiological perspective, the extended amygdala (EA) plays an important role
in stress- and pain-related components of AUD and is a site where the endocannabinoid (eCB) system
appears critical for modulating the reinforcing effects of ethanol and transition to dependence. Our previous
preclinical work has shown a functional role for the central amygdala (CeA), a constituent of the EA, as a key
brain region underlying hyperalgesia and escalation of alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent animal models.
Our preliminary data indicate an eCB system dysregulation generated by chronic alcohol exposure, which may
promote the use of alcohol and imply the therapeutic efficacy of cannabis/THC in individuals suffering from
AUD and AUD-related hyperalgesia. The main research objective of the current proposal is to investigate the
intricate interplay between the endocannabinoid system, pain, and alcohol use. The studies outlined in this F30
training proposal incorporate both animal modeling and clinical investigation to examine the predictions that: 1)
delta-9-THC administration alleviates hyperalgesia and reduces escalated alcohol self-administration in
alcohol-dependent male and female rats, and 2) increased cannabis use is associated with overall reductions
in pain symptoms and at-risk alcohol use in men and women. This proposal will provide a promising future
physician-scientist with vital research training to become an independent scientist in the field of alcohol and
clinical neuroscience research."

Significance. Intimate partner violence (IPV), the most common form of violence worldwide, is
associated with a wide range of negative health outcomes for victims and exposed children.
Precise, valid, and transportable measures of IPV are needed to accurately capture the
prevalence of IPV, assess the effectiveness of interventions to prevent and reduce IPV, and
appropriately allocate resources to combat this pervasive global health issue. This project will
address five limitations of current IPV measurement: measurement error, underreporting, lack of
consensus in IPV domains and outcome construction, lack of equivalence across countries, and
small item sets. Aims. This study aims to: (1) assess the performance of a quantitative method to
control for measurement error and underreporting of IPV; (2) identify the best-fitting measurement
model of IPV incorporating physical, sexual, and psychological subdomains in 45 lower- and
middle-income countries (LMICs) and assess its comparability across countries; and (3) test the
appropriateness of the model for higher-income countries (HICs) and assess the item functioning
of IPV scales used in HICs to identify possible items to add to IPV scales currently used in LMICs.
Data. This study will use data from the Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys, National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Surveys (NISVS), and the
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights’ Violence Against Women Survey (FRA-VAW).
Methods. For Aim 1, I will apply multiple overimputation to correct measurement error and
underreporting in multipurpose surveys. For Aim 2, I will use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)
to test the fit of four models of IPV in LMICs and use multi-group CFA to assess their equivalence
across countries. For Aim 3, I will test the fit of the model identified in Aim 2 in HICs and use item
response theory to assess item functioning of scales used in NISVS and FRA-VAW. Impact.
These investigations will inform recommendations to improve the precision, validity, and
transportability of IPV measures, contributing to better surveillance and evaluation of prevention
efforts. Training. This project will strengthen my subject matter knowledge of IPV measurement;
develop key quantitative skills in overimputation, Bayesian modeling, item response theory
methods, and structural equation modeling techniques; and hone my ability to communicate
scientific findings. Formal training, dissemination activities, and the mentorship of Drs. Cari Clark
(sponsor), Regine Haardoerfer (co-sponsor), and Robin Richardson (mentor) will enable the next
steps in my career as an independent researcher in the field of violence prevention."

Cell communication research is a growing field that is complimentary to, but distinct from, traditional signal trans-
duction fields. This emerging field emphasizes the spatiotemporal aspects of cell communication and quantitative
understanding of how information transmission and processing occurs. A central focus on the field is to under-
stand exactly what distinguishes “normal” and “disease” cell signaling behavior in terms of spatial and temporal
details. There are at least 80 labs worldwide that use live cell imaging, genetically encoded biosensors, compu-
tational image analysis, and mathematical models to determine modern quantitative concepts for cell communi-
cation. However, there is not a currently existing “home” conference for biomedical scientists working in this field,
limiting cross-fertilization of shared higher-level concepts across the many pathways studied in the field, including
immune signaling, receptor-mediated signal transduction, gene expression, cell cycle, and metabolic signaling
pathways. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a conference which can bring together the diversity of groups
in the cell communication field to share ideas and development of work focusing on how cell communication
occurs normally and is perturbed by disease. To address this need, we are facilitating a new conference, the
2024 Dynamics and Encoding in Cell Signaling FASEB Scientific Research Conference. For the first time, we
will bring together in-person an international community in the cell communication field. To accomplish this, we
aim to (1) provide structure for an emerging research field by establishing and building relationships and collab-
orations between senior scientists and early career researchers through networking opportunities and a speaker
lineup including both early career researchers and established leaders. This includes 20 trainee talks over the
course of the conference. Lightening talks will highlight trainee posters and encourage interactions and network-
ing at poster sessions between trainees and established investigators. We aim to (2) provide trainees with
knowledge, networks, and mentors for career opportunities through meetings and networking opportunities with
established researchers in both industry and academia. This first iteration of the meeting will aim to (3) create
new models by connecting researchers interested in related concepts across biologically different signaling and
regulatory systems, providing opportunities for researchers to think outside the typical boundaries of their work
and find new insights from colleagues in parallel fields. We will also aim to (4) promote access to new image
analysis and modeling technologies by emphasizing the latest technical advances in these areas. The confer-
ence will also highlight the diversity of the field as out of our 31 invited speakers, 13 are women and 10 are from
institutions outside the United States. Altogether, the Dynamics and Encoding in Cell Signaling FASEB Scientific
Research Conference provides a much needed and exciting forum for the cell communication field and will en-
able cross-disciplinary collaborations and insights into cell function and behavior that is not currently possible."

 Central nervous system (CNS) infections are common across all ages in Africa in people with or without
HIV-infection. In people with HIV, cryptococcal meningitis has historically been the second most common
AIDS-defining illness in Africa and the most common cause of adult meningitis in Africa overall. The next most
common cause of meningitis is likely TB meningitis, although CSF diagnostics are challenging. With the
widespread availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), long term survival in persons living with AIDS and CNS
infections should be possible, but delayed or inaccurate diagnoses and limited therapeutic options contribute to
poor outcomes. In the era of widespread ART access, more people are presenting with CNS infections
unmasked after starting ART or with virologic failure, yet their epidemiology and outcomes are unclear.
 We propose to continue a prospective cohort study to enroll >1000 new persons presenting with CNS
infections and HIV in Uganda. We will use point-of-care and molecular diagnostics to rapidly determine the
etiologies of CNS infections, with a specific focus on optimizing and validating new diagnostic tests, such as a
semi-quantitative cryptococcal antigen (CrAg-SQ) lateral flow assay and Xpert-HR Host Response gene
signature for active tuberculosis. Second, we will investigate a new oral antifungal, oteseconazole, conducting
a phase II randomized proof-of-concept clinical trial to investigate microbiologic activity in cryptococcosis.
Oteseconazole is a tetrazole that is >100-fold more active in vitro than fluconazole. Third, we will determine the
impact of oteseconazole on neurocognitive performance vs standard-of-care. Our Specific Aims include:
1. Determine the etiology of CNS infections in Africa among HIV-positive adults through use of a stepwise
 diagnostic algorithm, accounting for HIV therapy status.
2. Determine if adjunctive oteseconazole has greater in vivo activity than adjunctive fluconazole + flucytosine
 when added to single-dose IV liposomal amphotericin B in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.
3. Determine if oteseconazole is associated with better quantitative neurocognitive performance Z-score
 (QNPZ-8) at 3-months after cryptococcal meningitis compared to standard fluconazole consolidation.
Hypotheses:
1. We hypothesize that in the ART era, cryptococcal and TB meningitis will remain the two most common
 etiologies of meningitis in an HIV-positive population, with the majority now presenting ART-experienced.
2. We hypothesize oral oteseconazole will have a superior quantitative rate of CSF sterilization when added to
 IV amphotericin in comparison to adjunctive fluconazole + flucytosine. We hypothesize oteseconazole will
 have a lower incidence of culture-positive relapse through 1 year of follow up than standard fluconazole.
3. We hypothesize oteseconazole will have better QNPZ-8 at 3-months vs those randomized to fluconazole."
10999740,"Natural fertilization and embryo development require heathy spermatozoa to carry male genetic material to
fertilize the egg. During the final phase of spermatogenesis, the spermatids undergo dramatic changes including
the formation of the flagella, condensation of chromatin and so on. A spermatid-specific structure, the manchette,
is believed to play an essential role during spermiogenesis. Two functions for the manchette have been proposed:
1) transporting cargo proteins by intra-manchette transport (IMT) for sperm flagella assembly and 2) remodeling
chromatin by replacing histones with germ cell-specific nuclear proteins. However, little is known about how
protein complexes are assembled and transported in the manchette, or the manchette contributes to chromatin
remodeling; and the IMT process has never been observed. The long-term objective of this research is to explore
the mechanisms of meiosis-expressed gene 1 (MEIG1) complex in IMT for sperm flagella formation and in
remodeling the chromatin for normal embryogenesis. The proposed studies are based our findings that MEIG1
plays an indispensable role in normal sperm flagella formation and chromatin remodeling. MEIG1 is present in
the whole cell bodies in the spermatocytes and rounds spermatids, but it is recruited to the manchette by Parkin
co-regulated gene (PACRG). MEIG1/PACRG localization in the manchette is dependent on a PACRG binding
partner, the axonemal dynein light intermediate chain 1 (DNALI1). DNALI1 is a binding partner of cytoplasmic
dynein heavy chain 1 (DHC1), which directly binds to microtubules for cargo transport. Both DNALI1 and DHC1
are localized to the manchette independent of PACRG and MEIG1. More recently, intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI) using sperm from the PACRG mutant mice and a Meig1 KO mouse revealed failure of normal
embryogenesis, indicating a functional defect of sperm chromatin in these KO/mutant mice. Based on these
observations, we propose that MEIG1 complex plays important roles in transporting cargos through IMT for
sperm tail formation and in the formation of male-germ cell specific chromatin essential for normal
embryogenesis. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following studies.1: To dissect a motor-based
complex in the manchette and study its role in sperm formation; 2: To establish an in vivo system to investigate
the protein traffic through IMT; and 3: To examine the contribution and mechanisms of the MEIG1 complex for
remodeling nuclear chromatin during spermiogenesis. We expect that DNALI1/DHC1 motors form a cargo
transport system with MEIG1 complex in elongating spermatids for normal sperm formation; the dynamic traffic
process of IMT can be visualized in live germ cells using knock-in mouse models to express fluorescence-tagged
proteins; and MEIG1 complex plays an essential role in for chromatin remodeling by replacing histones with male
germ cell-specific nuclear proteins. The proposed studies will dissect the macromolecular complexes in the
manchette that are essential for spermiogenesis and establish an in vivo system to study IMT. The proposed
studies will also reveal a novel mechanism in chromatin remodeling for normal embryogenesis."

Mechanisms of Mechanotransduction by LIM Domain Proteins
Mechanical forces are essential to controlling the shape, movement and even many
aspects of cell physiology. Changes in the environment mechanics or defects in cellular
mechanoresponse are implicated in a plethora of diseases including atherosclerosis,
heart failure and cancer. A major challenge is to understand mechanotransduction - the
mechanisms by which mechanical information is detected and communicated to
pathways that control cell behavior. The LIM super family of proteins, which contain one
or more LIM domains, represents a large number of putative mechanosensitive cellular
proteins that are involved in physiological mechanotransduction pathways.
Understanding how the LIM domains function to detect and transmit information about
mechanical stress will result in a deeper understanding of mechanotransduction-based
signaling, which is important for developing strategies of disease treatment and organ
regeneration.
This proposal leverages an innovative combination of cell biophysics, biochemistry
molecular cell biology, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to investigate the
mechanism by which LIM domains sense mechanical stimuli in the actin cytoskeleton
and, in turn, initiate YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction signaling. We recently discovered
that a large number of LIM domains exhibit force-sensitive binding to actin filaments. Here
we propose to: (1) identify the mechanism by which LIM proteins are recruited to
mechanically stressed actin filaments, (2) determine how the LIM sequence enables
specificity in force-dependent recruitment within the actin cytoskeleton and (3) elucidate
how the mechanosensing by LIM protein LIMD1 initiates the YAP/TAZ
mechanotransduction pathway. These studies have the potential to demonstrate a highly
conserved mechanism of cell mechanosensing, and the methodologies will establish a
novel strategy for tackling cell mechanotransduction."

 Retinal degenerative diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as traumatic
injury, typically lead to loss of retinal neurons and thus sight. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop therapies
to regenerate lost retinal neurons for vision restoration. The ability for this type of intrinsic self-repair naturally occurs
in the zebrafish retina. Here, in response to retinal damage, the Müller glial cells (MGs) reprogram to a proliferative,
progenitor state capable of giving rise to new retinal neurons that integrate into the pre-existing retinal circuitry and
restore vision. While mammalian MGs do not exhibit the regenerative potential of the zebrafish, they have similar
gene expression and homeostatic roles. Additionally, in response to damage, mouse MGs display very limited and
transient entry into the cell cycle. These data suggest that an intrinsic proliferative and/or regenerative block likely
prevents mammalian MGs from undergoing sustained cell cycle re-entry and acquiring a multipotential progenitor-
like state. Recently, it was shown that the Hippo signaling pathway functions to repress sustained activity of the
TEAD transcription cofactor YAP, which is required for MG proliferation and reprogramming. By manipulating the
Hippo pathway, mammalian MGs might be able to elicit a robust regenerative response analogous to the zebrafish.
However, the upstream components that trigger initial YAP activation in MGs and subsequent repression by Hippo
are still completely unknown thereby limiting molecular entry points for therapeutic intervention. To complicate
matters, the Hippo pathway responds to a wide variety of context-dependent biochemical and biophysical inputs.
To move the field forward with an eye toward clinical translation, we must identify the MG-specific
regulators of YAP and the Hippo pathway. Therefore, this proposal aims to use cell type-specific metabolic
labeling and purification of proteins followed by mass spectroscopy on damaged mouse retinae. This approach,
which has yet to be performed on the mammalian retina, will allow us to decipher the nascent proteomes of
damaged photoreceptors and ganglion cells along with the immediate MG response during the period of YAP
activation and subsequent Hippo signaling. This information will generate new hypotheses and lay the
foundation for future studies aimed at broadening potential therapeutic targets for modulation of the Hippo
pathway to promote retinal regeneration."

that regulates blood pressure is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); its dysregulation at almost
any level can precipitate hypertension. For this reason, pathways in the RAAS can be manipulated for
pharmacological interventions (e.g., ACE inhibitors). In this application we interrogate the release of renin, the
rate limiting step of activation of the RAAS, from juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the afferent arterioles, and provide
exciting preliminary data to demonstrate a novel mechanically-sensitive signaling axis. In particular, the
application is focused on our recent work involving Panx1 channels in JG cells, and how they may be coupled
to the bona fide mechanically sensitive PIEZO1 channels specifically found in JG cells. Interestingly, we have
identified a role for estrogen receptor alpha that may provide a level of protection when coupled with PIEZO1.
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize renin release can be dictated by mechanically sensitive PIEZO-
Panx1 complexes in JG cells that are regulated by sex dependent and independent feedback. We propose three
aims to test this: 1. Protein kinase A (PKA) regulation of Panx1 channels; 2. changes in afferent arteriole
pressure is sensed by PIEZO1 and can regulate Panx1 and 3. estrogen receptor a regulates PIEZO channel
activity. In order to accomplish these aims, we have derived novel mouse lines (including Panx1T20A and Ren1D-
Cre/PIEZO1fl/fl) and state-of-the-art techniques (e.g., isolated renin secreting cells, isolated kidney perfusion,
calcium imaging on kidney slices). This application is composed of an internationally renowned team of experts,
with all proposed knockout mice being on hand, and robust preliminary data. We believe the data will provide an
important new layer of regulation in the RAAS capable of pharmacological intervention."

Only about 20% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients are expected to survive one year from
diagnosis, with the overall 5-year survival rate reported at a devastatingly low 8%, which is the lowest 5-year
survival rate of all major cancers. A hallmark of PDAC is the dense extracellular stroma called the desmoplasia,
which can occupy up to 90% of the tumor volume. The desmoplasia acts as a physical barrier preventing drugs
from reaching the tumor cells. Additionally, the desmoplasia acts as a barrier that prevents immune cells from
infiltrating the tumor, limiting the efficacy of immunotherapies. Systemically administered stromal targeting
therapies have provided a promising route for reducing desmoplasia and allow both cells and drugs to enter the
tumor more readily. However, these agents have a wide range of off-target effects, which limits the dose that the
patient can receive. The overall goal of this proposal is to advance a local controlled release platform for
intratumoral delivery of hyaluronidase, allowing for locally elevated concentrations of the enzyme without
systemic involvement. Aim 1 will focus on the use of a multi-scale modeling approach to define the parameter
space of implant design needed to achieve a uniform distribution of hyaluronidase within excised human tumors.
Aim 2 is focused on the use of medical imaging to characterize the effects of stromal targeting agents on tumor
blood flow and drug accumulation. Aim 3 will characterize the effects that stromal targeting therapies have as
immunomodulatory agents for improved immune surveillance and evaluate treatment efficacy. The proposed
studies will establish a novel approach for targeting tumor desmoplasia, improving mass transport into the
tumors, and enhancing immune cell infiltration into the tumors."

Reading disability (RD) is the most common neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 9% of
children. Children with RD have significant difficulty with word reading and spelling despite typical cognitive
ability. This disability is serious and can be life-long, impacting not only the ability to read and write (and learn
from printed material), but also negatively influencing socio-emotional well-being. RD can be treated, and
intensive research-based interventions often lead to significant improvements; however, there is significant
variability in how children respond to intervention. A sizeable number of RD children (~30%) show minimal gains
and are commonly referred to as non-responders. Identifying factors that predict response to intervention can
help us understand why current interventions fail to meet the needs of all students and how to develop new
interventions. However, such predictors remain poorly understood, particularly for older students. Extant
knowledge of predictors at the individual and environmental level is limited because of a lack of large-scale
research focusing on: (1) older children/persistently poor readers; (2) sensitive (including neurocognitive)
measures collected in ecologically valid contexts; (3) school-based interventions and (4) frequent and equidistant
assessment over the course of instruction.
Here we propose a novel in-school cognitive neuroscience community engaged research (CER) approach that
will afford frequent longitudinal assessment of children with RD as they undergo reading intervention as part of
their school curriculum for two years. We propose to collect behavioral and neurobiological data from two cohorts
of students with RD: the first cohort (n=204) attend private learning disability (LD) schools for children with
reading difficulties that include intensive reading intervention at the core of their curriculum; the second cohort
attend public and charter schools (n=204) with specialized curricula for students with RD. We also include a
comparison sample of typically developing children (n=156) from public and charter schools to establish
normative trajectories with our measures. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Establish trajectories and
predictors of reading gains in RD students at LD schools using standardized measures and information on
school-based instruction; (2) Empirically test the predictive utility and trajectories of three theoretically motivated
measures, guided by computational and neurobiological models of reading; (3) Assess the generalizability of our
findings by adding a diverse sample of readers at public and charter schools; and (4) Investigate the multivariate
relations between our behavioral, neural, and instructional measures from Aims 1-3 and reading growth across
samples. This neurocognitive ""field research"" using in-school laboratories is a potentially transformative
approach and an important step in understanding intervention response among children with RD. The
findings will contribute to the evidence base supporting individualized reading interventions for children
with RD and the science of reading more broadly."
10982091,"Enteric neuronal loss is responsible for intestinal dysmotility in significant clinical conditions including aging,
diabetes mellitus, and constipation. The overarching goal of this renewal application is to further delineate the
neuronal degeneration pathway triggered by a Western fat diet (WD). Preliminary data demonstrate that
primary mouse enteric neurons and isolated human enteric neurons exposed to PA have increased cellular
iron levels and increased ferritin expression. PA-induced ferroptosis is prevented by the ferroptosis inhibitor,
ferrostatin 1. Free iron catalyzes the increase in neuronal ROS and membrane lipid peroxidation. WD-fed mice
have neuronal loss and delayed colonic motility have increased ferritin expression in myenteric ganglia. Thus,
we hypothesize that WD-induced colonic neurodegeneration and resultant colonic dysmotility occur
from increased intracellular labile iron that leads to enteric neuron ferroptosis through enhanced
mitochondrial stress and impaired mitochondrial function. We will perform in vitro studies in primary
mouse enteric neurons, an enteric neuronal cell line (IM-FEN) and isolated human ganglion networks, and in
vivo in the WD-fed mouse model and ob/ob mice. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific
Aims: Specific Aim 1: To establish the mechanistic role of excess iron in SFA/WD-induced enteric
neuronal loss. Using primary mouse enteric neuronal cultures and enteric neuronal cell lines, we will
demonstrate that SFA increase β-oxidation and expression of iron transporters (Tfr1, DMT1 and ZIP14)
resulting in elevated iron uptake and intracellular labile iron levels leading to ferroptosis. Mice fed a WD and
ob/ob mice will be assessed for enteric neuronal ferritin expression and ferroptosis. The necessity of iron in
enteric neuronal loss will be assessed by determining if enteric neuronal specific knockdown of Tfr1 in WD-fed
mice prevent the WD-induced neuronal loss. Specific Aim 2: To determine that increased mitochondrial
iron triggers ROS production leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and SFA/WD-induced enteric
neuronal degeneration. Our preliminary data demonstrate that SFA increase mitochondrial iron and ROS
and trigger mitochondrial dysfunction. We will determine the effects of SFA on mitochondrial ROS, function,
structure, mass and dynamics in enteric neurons. We will determine whether MitoQ (an inhibitor of
mitochondrial ROS) and DFP (a mitochondrial iron chelator) prevent SFA-induced enteric neuronal cell death.
A novel AAV targeting enteric neurons will deliver the antioxidant Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) to mice to see if preserving
mitochondrial function prevents neuronal ferroptosis. Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate the translational
relevance of iron overload in isolated human myenteric ganglia and in colonic myenteric ganglia of
obese individuals. The clinical relevance of the mouse findings will be validated in human studies. Using
freshly isolated networks of human myenteric ganglia from lean, overweight, and obese patients we will
establish that increased cellular and mitochondrial iron levels, occur in these cells after SFA exposure."
10980886,"ABSTRACT
Human parents and non-parents show sharply distinct patterns of brain activity in response to infant cries or
laughter. How is this change in brain responses accomplished? Receiving parental care is essential for
appropriate physical, cognitive, and emotional development in infants. Failure to care for an infant predisposes
the individual to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Caregiving behavior is mediated by neural
circuits that promote bonding with infants. Past research has primarily focused on neural mechanisms in
mothers associated with pregnancy, parturition, and lactation that facilitate parenting. However, many species
show bi-parental care, suggesting that additional mechanisms drive infant care in males. Recent studies have
identified neural circuits involved in pro- and anti-parental behavior in both males and females. In this
proposal, we aim to leverage our knowledge about these molecularly defined circuits involved in pro- and anti-
parental behavior in mice to reveal how hypothalamic circuits nodes directly interact to coordinate infant-
directed behavior across behavioral states. How does circuit activity in molecularly defined populations
correlate with infant-directed behavior? In Aim 1, we will address this question by determining the relationship
of two molecularly defined circuit nodes critical for infant-directed behavior using in vivo fiber photometry and
chemogenetic manipulations. What synaptic mechanisms underlie observed behaviorally relevant circuit
activity? In Aim 2, we will address this question using electrophysiological (whole cell recording with
optogenetic or pharmacological manipulations) techniques to dissect cell intrinsic and plasticity mechanisms
within this molecularly defined microcircuit in behaviorally phenotyped animals. These experiments are
designed to disentangle intrinsic mechanisms and plasticity induced by synaptic or neuropeptidergic effects
across behavioral states in both sexes. What molecules underlie behaviorally relevant circuit and synaptic
mechanisms? In Aim 3, we will address this question using translating ribosome affinity purification followed
by RNASeq to identify candidate genes for specific mechanisms underlying behavioral, circuit, and synaptic
effects. These genes will be validated by in situ hybridization. Together, these experiments will uncover the
common or dissociable neural circuit mechanisms underlying adaptive infant-directed behavior across sexes
and behavioral states and provide the initial electrophysiological characterization of this neuropeptidergic
hypothalamic microcircuitry. With the increased recognition of a dedicated circuit for negative infant-directed
behavior, it is critical to have a mechanistic understanding of the neurobiological and physiological interactions
among circuitry underlying pro- and anti-parental behaviors. Understanding the mechanisms for caregiving
allows us to identify key entry points for intervention to support healthy bonding and protect neurodevelopment."
10988806,"Understanding and decoding the intricacies of gene regulatory networks is crucial in genomics for insights into
gene expression and cellular functions. Traditionally, research in this field has heavily relied on transcriptome
data and machine learning to infer these networks, but this approach has mostly used bulk tissue samples. This
method overlooks the nuances of individual cells and their microenvironments, limiting our understanding to a
broader, macroscopic level.
The advent of spatial transcriptomics marks a significant shift, promising to unravel these networks at a single-
cell and spatial level. This technology allows for the exploration of gene expression in relation to spatial dynamics,
enhancing our understanding of tissue organization and cellular functions.
However, adapting machine learning to spatial genomics faces challenges. One major issue is the scarcity of
spatial transcriptome data, which hampers the effectiveness of deep learning methods known for their superiority
in network estimation. Another challenge is the need for models that account for the physical positions of cells,
as traditional methods treat data as independent and identically distributed, ignoring spatial relationships.
To address these challenges, this proposal outlines two main objectives:
Aim 1: Developing deep learning methods for cell-type resolution regulatory network estimation capable
of transferring between scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. We will develop machine learning
mdoels that can integrate components that explicitly model the regulatory network, distinguishing cell types
based on transcriptomic data. The approach will use domain-invariant regularization to adapt from scRNA-seq
to spatial transcriptomics, employing GTEx and HuBMap data sets.
Aim 2: Developing deep learning methods with spatial regularization for estimating regulatory networks
at spatial resolution within spatial transcriptomics. We will develop techniques that factor in the spatial
positioning of cells during the learning process. The hypothesis is that cells in close spatial proximity have similar
regulatory structures. This aim will also use GTEx and HuBMap data, along with collaborative efforts on spatial
transcriptome data of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
Overall, this proposal seeks to lead the development of advanced deep learning models, integrating cell-type
resolution and spatial dimensions to revolutionize our understanding of regulatory networks in genomics to both
the cell-type and spatial resolution."
10995036,"Abstract
The development of effective therapies for the treatment of T cell-dependent autoimmune diseases requires a
lucid understanding of the mechanisms by which T cell tolerance is established and conferred. In mice and
humans, the T cell repertoire harbors self-reactive conventional T cells with pathogenic potential, necessitating
extrinsic regulation by Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells and other mechanisms. In this regard, research over
the past three decades has identified a unique CD4+ regulatory T cell population, termed “Tr1” cells, that is
characterized by lack of Foxp3 expression, production of the suppressive cytokine IL-10, and potent regulatory
activity capable of preventing or stifling autoimmune reactions in murine models. It has been proposed that Tr1
cells serve as a “failsafe” in scenarios in which tolerance mediated by Foxp3+ Treg cells is incomplete.
Importantly, numerous studies have demonstrated that suppressive, antigen-specific Tr1-like cells can be
generated in vitro and in vivo, galvanizing considerable interest in harnessing Tr1 cells for the clinical treatment
of human autoimmune disease. Despite this great interest, there remain fundamental aspects of Tr1 biology that
have evaded elucidation. In this study, we will perform clonal analysis of naturally occurring Tr1 (nTr1) cells in
mice. We will utilize a two-tiered strategy pairing TCR repertoire profiling of Tr1-phenotype cells with clonal
analyses of TCR “retrogenic” T cells expressing Tr1-biased TCRs. The objectives of this proposal are to define
the nature of the TCR repertoire expressed by nTr1 cells and define the differentiation trajectory, reactivity, and
transcriptional profile of these clones in vivo and in vitro. We will test the hypothesis that nTr1 cell differentiation
is initiated in the thymus following the recognition of widespread self-antigens, leading to the establishment of a
stable peripheral pool of nTr1 cells expressing a distinct TCR repertoire. In Aim 1, we will define the TCR
repertoire expressed by naturally occurring Tr1 cells. This will provide key insights regarding the diversity and
nature of antigens that direct nTr1 differentiation, the stability of nTr1 cells, and the clonal relationship between
nTr1 cells and other T cells subsets. In Aim 2 we will determine whether nTr1 cells are reactive to widespread
self-antigens, regional self-antigens, or antigens derived from commensal microbiota, and will define whether
nTr1 cell differentiation is triggered in the thymus or periphery. In addition, we will use RNA sequencing to define
unique signatures that distinguish nTr1 cells from other regulatory and conventional T cell subsets. Our studies
will yield the first clonal analyses of naturally occurring IL-10-producing Tr1 cells – an important regulatory T cell
population for which fundamental aspects of their antigen specificity, differentiation, lineage stability, and function
remain undefined. Ultimately, these advances will be crucial for the development of new strategies to mobilize
nTr1 cells for the treatment of human autoimmune disease."

Introduction: IL-13 is elevated in patients with COVID-19, in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 IL-13 neutralization
improved survival and decreased pulmonary deposition of hyaluronan (HA), and in a clinical trial IL-13/IL-4
blockade during severe acute COVID-19 improved DLCO and/or 6 minute walk test at one year. Here, we will
determine in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 how IL-13 is induced, impacts HA matrices and lung inflammation.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that IL-13 produced by ILC2s in the lung during COVID-19 induces a hyaluronan
(HA) matrix that via HA receptors recruits inflammatory cells, resulting in severe COVID-19.
Significance: Uncovering the mechanisms of IL-13-induced hyaluronan matrices and signaling has the promise
of novel therapeutic approaches directed at the IL-13 - hyaluronan pathway, for acute and long term COVID-19,
as well as being of importance for other pulmonary diseases where hyaluronan is known to contribute.
Investigators: The application is the product of over two years of collaboration between investigators at the
University of Virginia (UVA) and the University of Manchester. At UVA MPI William Petri brings expertise as a
virologist and physician-scientist, and Jie Sun expertise in pulmonary viral host defense. The University of
Manchester MPIs bring expertise in type 2 immunity (Judith Allen) and hyaluronan (Tony Day).
Innovation: Original observations and hypotheses include: (i) IL-13 contributes to acute and long-term
respiratory failure in COVID-19; (ii) that IL-13 does so in part by activating HA deposition and by regulating IL-6;
and (iii) HA recruits to the lungs inflammatory cells expressing HA receptor(s), that result in damage to the lung.
Approach:
Specific Aim 1 (UVA): Hypothesis: IL-13-mediated pathology is driven by IL-33 induction of ILC2s and increased
IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 expression, upregulated by IL-6. In the COVID-19 mouse model we will explore the roles of IL-
33 in inducing IL-13, and the contribution and interaction of IL-13 with IL-6 in promoting inflammation.
Specific Aim 2 (Manchester): Hypothesis: IL-13 induces a cross-linked inflammatory HA-heavy chain matrix
(HC•HA) in the lung. In uninfected mice, we will test the role of IL-13 in activating HC•HA matrix formation.
Specific Aim 3 (UVA): Hypothesis: IL-13 acts via pathogenic HA matrix formation to increase cellular
inflammation through HA receptors including CD44 and decrease lung function. The HC•HA network in the lungs
of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 with or without IL-13 inhibition will be compared to that induced by IL-13 in a
naïve mouse (from Aim 2), and the role of immune cells recruited to the HC•HA matrix will be determined.
Environment: Bill Petri and Jie Sun at the University of Virginia work at the intersection of immunology and
infection. At the University of Manchester, the Division of Immunology, Immunity to Infection and Respiratory
Medicine (Judith Allen) and the Division of Cell Matrix Biology & Regenerative Medicine (Tony Day) uniquely
bring together type 2 immunity, hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix, and infection."
10978572,"Acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of ethanol, contributes to many human pathologies. It is mainly detoxified by
the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). In addition to the common ALDH2*2 of >500 million
people of East Asian ancestry, we have identified additional common ALDH2 variants of other genetic
ancestries. Ethanol exposure in cells expressing these less active ALDH2 variants increases aldehydic load,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. Considering the critical role of aldehydes on health, that ethanol (via
fermentation) was present throughout mammalian evolution, and that ALDH2 insufficiencies are common, we
hypothesize that enzymes other than ALDH2 may provide an additional detoxification capacity against increased
aldehydic load and the resulting cytotoxicity. We also hypothesize that inactive variants of these other enzymes
may be common in specific genetic ancestry, rendering individuals who have ALDH2 insufficiency even more
sensitive to ethanol-induced toxicity than carriers of ALDH2 insufficiency alone. If these hypotheses are correct,
the assessment of ALDH2 genetic polymorphisms alone is not sufficient to assess disease risk.
In this proposal, we focus on mitochondrial enzymes because of the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in
many human pathologies. Our specific aims for the project are:
Aim 1: Identify variants common to specific ancestry groups of aldehyde metabolizing mitochondrial enzymes
and determine whether they have reduced activity or stability in vitro
Aim 2: Determine if inactive variants of these mitochondrial enzymes alone or together with ALDH2*2 (as a
model of ALDH2 insufficiency) affect ethanol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in culture.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of acute and chronic ethanol treatment, in vivo, in mice in which an inactive human
ALDH2 variant and an inactive human variant of a second enzyme identified in Aim 2 were knocked in.
Innovation: our work represents the first systematic study to begin identifying additional mitochondrial enzymes
that complement ALDH2 in reducing ethanol- and aldehydes-induced toxicity. Our study is also the first to
examine the potential risk from ethanol exposure in different human genetic ancestry using model systems.
Significance: As ethanol is consumed by most adults in the world, if our hypotheses are correct that additional
mitochondrial enzymes are critical in protecting from an increased mitochondrial aldehydic load, this study will
have important clinical implications and may further contribute to precision medicine based on the activity of
these understudied mitochondrial enzymes."
10978575,"Mitochondria play an essential role in cellular function and impact human health through varied mechanisms,
including energy metabolism, cell signaling, and apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that mitochondrial
DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), which reflects some aspects of mitochondrial function, can readily be measured
from DNA extracted from buffy coat, and is associated with various aging-related diseases and phenotypes. The
recent availability of whole-genome sequence (WGS) data in large biobanks, along with plasma metabolomics
and proteomics, vastly expands the ability to assess mitochondrial function in large sample sizes. Specifically,
we hypothesize that a comprehensive assessment of mtDNA variation, including mtDNA-CN, homoplasmy
(inherited variation), and heteroplasmy (somatic variation) in 680,000 subjects, combined with
metabolomics/proteomics, will identify novel causal associations between mitochondrial function and all-cause
mortality, CVD, and frailty. To test this hypothesis we will first identify plasma metabolites/proteins associated
with mitochondrial function. We focus on identifying metabolites/proteins associated with mtDNA sequence
variation, leveraging the concept of Mendelian randomization (MR) to avoid confounding. We will study omics
measured in up to 300,000 UK Biobank (UKB) participants, with validation in TOPMed samples (n~25,000), and
compare associations with mtDNA sequence variation to those for mtDNA-CN. Biomarkers associated with
mtDNA genetic variation and not mtDNA-CN will be considered orthogonal biomarkers. Second, we will stablish
phenotypic associations between biomarkers of mitochondrial function and aging-related diseases. We will
determine the association of mitochondrial function biomarker with all-cause mortality, CVD, CVD risk factors,
and frailty in UKB samples, with validation in TOPMed samples. We will also explore multivariable models looking
for potential interactions between the various measures of mitochondrial function. Finally, we will discriminate
causal from non-causal associations of mitochondrial function biomarkers and aging-related disease. We will
identify instrument variables for MR by conducting GWAS of nuclear variants with mtDNA-CN, heteroplasmy,
and mtDNA-associated metabolites/proteins. We will use MR to determine causality and causal mediation
analysis to determine mediated proportions. We will then use systems biology approaches to identify the relevant
gene(s) at each locus and map putative functional variants for experimental validation. We will characterize the
identified genes by assessing mitochondrial function (e.g., cellular respiration, glycolytic flux) and quantity
(nucleoid density, mass). In sum, this proposal will leverage the combination of genetic variation, both inherited
and somatic, in conjunction with mtDNA-CN, metabolomics, and proteomics, is a highly innovative approach that
will identify readily measurable biomarkers of mitochondrial function. By combining MR with functional validation,
we will identify causal genes, identifying therapeutic targets for aging-related diseases exacerbated by
mitochondrial deficiency, and serve as potential readouts for testing molecular therapies."

 GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain and targets of
important therapeutics and drugs of abuse. Given their susceptibility to diverse therapeutic and abused
compounds and their involvement in anxiety disorders, excitotoxicity, and epilepsy, a comprehensive
understanding of this receptor is imperative. In this competing renewal application, we build upon our initial
elucidation of structures of the α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor subtype. Specific projects span structural
pharmacology, the mechanisms underlying ion channel gating, and studies of receptors in healthy and
diseased brain tissue. Our proposed efforts in structural pharmacology focus on unexplored drug classes
including allosteric modulators used in the clinic and prominently abused drugs. We propose to first identify
binding sites, then interrogate mechanisms of potentiation through a combination of functional assays and
computational approaches. Concurrently, we propose to address a significant gap in our understanding of
GABAA receptor signaling, the structure-based mechanism for channel gating. Employing time-resolved cryo-
EM techniques coupled with molecular dynamics, our aim is to capture the activated state, mapping transitions
among resting, activated, and desensitized states. To better understand the assemblies of GABAA receptors
found in their native environments, we propose to develop approaches for mapping subunit arrangements in
receptors in brain tissue. We propose to examine distinct brain regions to provide insights relevant to targeted
therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach integrates structural biology,
electrophysiology, and computational analyses, yielding an expanded understanding of GABAA receptors
relevant to basic signaling mechanisms, drug abuse, and drug development."
10996542,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer-associated chromosomal abnormalities frequently arise through punctuated episodes of genomic
instability. This is exemplified by chromothripsis, the shattering and re-stitching of individual chromosomes, which
generates a distinct rearrangement signature in ~30% of pan-cancer genomes. Chromothripsis is driven by
mitotic errors and the formation of aberrant nuclear bodies termed micronuclei that entrap mis-segregated
chromosomes outside of the nucleus. Due to defects in nuclear envelope assembly, micronuclei undergo
frequent and irreversible rupture that inactivates normal nuclear processes, including DNA replication, DNA
repair, and transcription. During mitotic entry, chromosomes in micronuclei undergo extensive breakage into tens
to hundreds of fragments through incompletely defined mechanism(s). Our laboratory recently identified that
fragmented chromosomes remain bound throughout mitosis by protein-mediated tethers, which facilitates the
re-incorporation of the fragments into the nucleus and its subsequent reassembly. This cascade gives rise to the
highly complex yet localized rearrangements that are often observed in cancer genomes. In addition to the
deletion of tumor suppressor genes and/or formation of oncogenic fusion genes, chromothripsis can also result
in the circularization and amplification of genes on extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs). While several key
mechanistic steps have been well characterized, the source(s) of mitotic chromosome fragmentation remain
unclear. To identify genetic drivers of chromothripsis, I recently conducted pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens using
a chromosome-specific micronucleus system. I unexpectedly identified that a genome maintenance mechanism
known as the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway functions as a critical driver of chromothripsis and complex genomic
rearrangements. My preliminary data suggest that the FA pathway promotes mitotic chromosome shattering
through the recruitment of structure-specific DNA endonucleases to under-replicated DNA intermediates from
micronuclei, which is then followed by mitotic DNA synthesis, a process that may be analogous to the processing
of late-replicating fragile sites in the genome. Here I propose to further define the role of the FA pathway and
mitotic DNA synthesis in chromothripsis. First, I will comprehensively identify regions of the micronucleated
chromosome undergoing active processing during mitosis by the FA pathway. I will also determine whether
mitotic DNA synthesis is required for priming fragments for reassembly in the next cell cycle. Second, I will
leverage pre-clinical cell models to investigate whether inhibition of the FA pathway represents a feasible
therapeutic strategy to suppress chromothripsis-induced emergence of drug-resistant cancer cells harboring
ecDNAs. These studies will shed light on how a genome-protective DNA repair mechanism can be co-opted as
a pathological driver of cancer genome instability. In addition to this research plan and with support from my
sponsor, co-sponsor, and dissertation committee, I have also established a well-defined training and career
development plan that will further bolster my abilities as an independent researcher focused on cancer biology."
10996617,"Project Summary.
 Stress granules (SGs) – cytoplasmic aggregates formed from stalled translation initiation complexes
upon cell stress – have emerged as critical regulators of oncogenesis. SGs can confer cancer cells the ability to
withstand harsh biological conditions and can impart tumorigenic translational states through mRNA
sequestration. However, a mechanistic understanding of how SGs endogenously regulate tumorigenesis in vivo
remains elusive. My research proposal leverages a humanized zebrafish melanoma model where tumor
development can be visualized and manipulated from the precursor stage to its single cell of origin and beyond.
Using this system, I have found that SGs are formed in melanoma precursor cells and persist during tumor
initiation and progression. Furthermore, my preliminary data shows that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of a
key SG component, g3bp1, in melanoma initiating cells delays the establishment of the cancer precursor zone,
an essential initiating cell phase in the emergence of melanoma. Taken together, the overarching hypothesis
of my proposal is that SGs are formed in melanoma precursor cells to enhance viability upon tumorigenic
stress and once formed, subsequently accelerate melanomagenesis by enabling an oncogenic
translational profile. To test my hypothesis, I will first determine the impact of stress granule formation on
melanomagenesis by perturbating key components using genetically engineered zebrafish and chemical biology.
I will subsequently test whether modification of stress granule formation alters melanoma cell oncogenicity using
flow cytometry and subcutaneous transplant assays. In addition, I will elucidate the contribution of RNA
sequestration by stress granules toward melanoma development using proximity labeling and translatome
profiling. I will then functionally resolve the contribution of SG-sequestered mRNA using zebrafish genetics.
Lastly, I will perform immunostaining of human melanoma samples for proteins encoded by mRNAs with
preferential translation in melanoma initiating cells, assessing the conservation of these molecules and their
potential to serve as melanoma biomarkers. Ultimately, the results obtained herein will provide mechanistic insight
toward the functional role of stress granules during cancer initiation. As stress granules are detected across many
cancer types, this work will elucidate nodes of tumor biology that can be exploited to halt a broad spectrum of
cancers before they arise.
 In this proposal, I establish training goals that will expand my conceptual and technical expertise in cancer
biology and RNA processing. In addition, I present aims that will enable the acquisition of the professional
skillsets necessary to achieve my long-term research goal, which is to run my own lab at an academic research
institution studying the basic biology of RNA processing during cancer initiation."

Spinal cord injury (SCI) affects an estimated 294,000 patients in the United States and often occurs in the
setting of trauma. Sequelae of SCI range from impaired sensorimotor function to complete paralysis, leading to
detrimental effects on employment, social integration, and healthcare system utilization. Importantly, neurologic
losses are mitigated by a post-acute care strategy which emphasizes rehabilitative care provided at acute
inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). Despite the benefits of IRF care for SCI patients, not all patients with
spinal cord injuries are treated at IRFs. Recent work from our group has shown that publicly insured SCI
patients are less likely to receive care at IRFs compared to privately insured patients, even after controlling for
age, injury severity, and comorbidities. The reasons for this finding are unclear. It is unknown to what degree
lack of IRF care for SCI patients increases their long-term morbidity and healthcare utilization, and it is
unknown whether cost-savings from decreased long-term healthcare utilization would justify expanded access
to IRF care. In Aim 1, we will characterize rates of harm associated with SCI, such as pressure ulcers,
urosepsis, and deep venous thrombosis, among patients who received IRF care versus those who did not. In
Aim 2, we will quantify rates of unplanned healthcare resource use, measured in dollar costs of
rehospitalization and emergency department encounters, among SCI patients who received IRF care versus
those who did not. In Aim 3, we will forecast healthcare system costs associated with triaging patients to
appropriate post-acute care rehabilitation and calculate the cost-effectiveness of such a move. The knowledge
gained from this project will increase our understanding of the role of post-acute care on healthcare system
costs and directly inform healthcare policy interventions regarding the post-acute care of trauma patients with
spinal cord injury."

Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC), a rare but increasingly prevalent cause of cardiomyopathy stemming
from developmental arrest of myocardial compaction, was identified as a primarily genetic, independent
cardiomyopathy by the AHA in 2006 following debate due to its frequent association with variable degrees of
myocardial dysfunction and other congenital heart defects (CHD). Symptom heterogeneity has likely left many
cases undiagnosed, giving a lower estimation of its real impact as a cardiomyopathy. Congenital LVNC can
progress in severity throughout life contributing to decompensated heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Little
is known about the molecular mechanism(s) that lead to LVNC, but mutations in MYH7 (encoding human beta-
cardiac myosin) have been implicated as a putative genetic cause. Human beta-cardiac myosin (M2β) mutations
are known molecular triggers for heritable cardiomyopathies, typically impacting the motor protein’s intrinsic
motor properties and/or auto-inhibited state. Studies of cardiomyopathy mutations in M2β have demonstrated
that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is triggered by mutations that cause hyper-contraction and dilated
cardiomyopathy (DCM) is triggered by mutations that cause hypo-contraction. However, very few studies have
examined LVNC mutations and thus it is unclear how it falls on this genotype-phenotype spectrum. Examining
LVNC cardiac myosin mutations would enlighten us about the unique etiology and reveal important information
about myosin structure and function. We hypothesize that depressed monomeric ensemble force and/or an
increase in autoinhibited state stabilization could trigger severe hypo-contraction and tissue level
tension/force imbalances, leading to excessive trabeculation in LVNC. We conclude that additional
biophysical LVNC M2β mutant studies both in purified protein and cellular systems are required to
uncover common allosteric pathways altered in LVNC. Our goal is to investigate the impact of clinically
identified MYH7 LVNC mutations M362R and L655M on protein structure-function, mechanochemistry, and
ultimately pathogenic myocardial remodeling. M362R is in the loop 4 region of the motor domain known to play
an important role in head-head interactions, tropomyosin positioning, and actin binding. L655M may disrupt a
critical allosteric pathway leading to actin-activation of the power stroke and thus impair the transition into the
force generating states. This proposal will characterize two LVNC mutations selected based on the isolation of
LVNC from other forms of heritable cardiomyopathy and on their respective locations within myosin known to be
important for performance. We will utilize transient kinetic, novel applications of FRET biosensors and
analytical ultracentrifugation, and hiPSC-CM derived myofibril-based techniques to elucidate how these
mutations impair myosin function leading to LVNC pathogenic remodeling of the heart."

Over the last decade, pancreatic islet transplantation has become a consistent and effective minimally invasive
approach to restore normoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes1. Despite recent advances, widespread
application has been limited by several barriers, including (1) poor survival and engraftment of islets following
infusion into the portal vein of the liver, secondary to instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) and
ischemia, (2) an inability to consistently achieve long-term insulin independence despite multiple infusions of
islets from up to three donors, (3) a critical shortage of donor islets available for transplant, and (4) the inability
to retrieve the graft in real time in case of adverse events. This proposal aims to address all four of these barriers
utilizing genome-engineered stem-cell-derived beta cells. In contrast to cadaveric islets, human pluripotent stem
cell-derived beta (SC-beta) cells represent a replenishable source of replacement beta cells2–7. Improving
engraftment of SC-beta cells in an extra-hepatic site, together with engineering safety switches to delete any
implanted SC-derived cells that display aberrant growth, will render this therapy safer and more effective,
bringing benefit to more patients. Our prior work has shown that co-transplantation of parathyroid gland tissue
with adult donor islets improves survival and engraftment at a retrievable intramuscular injection site in mice. We
hypothesize that the secreted factors uniquely expressed by parathyroid gland may improve islet survival and
vascularization. However, to overcome the limitations of parathyroid gland donor tissue availability and
procurement, these effective factors will be introduced into stem-cell-derived beta cells using genome
engineering strategies to improve engraftment and angiogenesis. Moreover, because the potential for outgrowth
or oncogenesis is a major safety concern with any stem-cell-derived therapy, we will dually incorporate inducible
safety switches that will allow for small molecule-driven clearance of residual pluripotent cells following beta cell
differentiation, as well as clearance of the entire graft in the instance of an adverse event. These approaches will
be vetted by transplanting engineered stem-cell-derived beta cells into immunodeficient mice that have induced
diabetes, to directly assess the disease-modifying activity of these implanted cells in a physiological context.
Ultimately, this work will advance the therapeutic potential of beta cell transplantation and address the major
current clinical bottlenecks that prevent stem-cell-derived beta cell therapy from becoming a universal treatment
strategy for diabetes."
10999160,"Preeclampsia is one of the most common and serious medical complications of pregnancy. While
there are many risk factors for the development of preeclampsia, women with underlying kidney
disease are at significantly increased risk for developing preeclampsia and adverse outcomes
related to preeclampsia. In women with impaired renal function, such as in women with prior
history of acute kidney injury, in renal allograft recipients, in women who carry a single kidney, or
in women with chronic kidney disease, an inability to increase glomerular filtration rate during
pregnancy is thought to lead to excess risk of preeclampsia, though precise mechanisms are
largely unknown. In recently published studies, we observed that uninephrectomized pregnant
mice developed new-onset hypertension, proteinuria, and high circulating soluble fms-like
tyrosine kinase 1 during the third trimester, all features reminiscent of humans with preeclampsia.
In preliminary studies, we have generated a second mouse model of impaired renal reserve
secondary to prior acute kidney injury that also develops preeclampsia-like syndrome during late
pregnancy. To understand mechanisms, we studied plasma metabolite profiles and noted that
mice with impaired renal reserve failed to upregulate L-kynurenine, a metabolite of tryptophan
and that is critical for de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis during pregnancy. In
this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that deficiency of L-kynurenine during pregnancy in
models of maternal kidney dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of abnormal placentation
and the excess risk of preeclampsia. We will use state-of-art methods including in vivo plasma
volume measurements, uterine artery blood flow measurements, preeclampsia biomarkers,
transcriptomics and metabolic profiling of placental tissue and plasma to confirm a role for
deficient L-kynurenine in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia in two distinct mouse models of
preeclampsia due to pre-existing renal impairment. We have assembled a team of experts
(physiology, metabolism, and pathology) to complement PI’s expertise in preeclampsia biology.
Ultimately, our goal is to translate our findings to the bedside through improved methods of
diagnosis and monitoring of preeclampsia in this high-risk population, and through design of
targeted, pathophysiology-based interventions."
10998772,"SUMMARY. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes an abrupt
onset of fever with severe joint and muscle pain. In a significant fraction of patients, chronic and debilitating
arthritis can develop and persist for months to years, with recent epidemiological projections suggesting there
are more than 400,000 patients in the Western Hemisphere alone with chronic CHIKV musculoskeletal disease.
Patients affected by chronic CHIKV disease show elevated synovial proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrating
cells including monocytes and CD4+ T cells. In addition, persistent CHIKV RNA is detected in human patients,
non-human primates, and mice for months to years after infection. To identify the cells that harbor this RNA
during the chronic phase of disease, we recently engineered a recombinant CHIKV to express Cre recombinase
and demonstrated that the infection of tdTomato reporter mice resulted in persistent tdTomato+ cells. To date,
our analysis has revealed that fibroblasts and macrophages are key cell types that harbor viral RNA in the chronic
phase. Therefore, this system allows us to test the hypothesis that during chronic disease, a subset of CHIKV
infected cells survive infection and harbor persistent, non-productively replicating viral RNA that functions as a
pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) to drive persistent inflammation. The premise of this proposal is
to utilize this CHIKV lineage tracing system in a murine model of CHIKV arthritis to identify, isolate, and
characterize the cells that are infected, survive CHIKV infection, and harbor viral RNA. We will test the
hypothesis that this persistent RNA activates pattern recognition receptors during acute and chronic disease
driving inflammatory phenotypes in both macrophages and fibroblasts. These studies will provide important new
insight into the pathogenesis of chronic CHIKV arthritis and possibly create new avenues for therapeutic
interventions."
10997884,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Early puberty is associated with adverse health outcomes over the life course, including psychopathology
in adolescence, and reproductive cancers, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. The age of
pubertal onset has declined dramatically over the past 40 years in the United States (US), with alarming
racial/ethnic disparities. These disparities may amplify future health inequities in chronic conditions, yet remain
poorly understood. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric endocrinology centers across twelve countries
reported large increases in the incidence of central precocious puberty (CPP), a rare condition characterized by
developing secondary sexual characteristics before age eight in girls and nine in boys. However, existing studies
are subject to limitations such as small samples from specialty care settings, insufficient power to examine trends
in boys, and reliance on diagnostic criteria for CPP. In addition to CPP, it is important to examine normative
timing of early pubertal milestones, including onset of pubic hair and breasts/testes development, because they
represent the earliest observable markers of underlying hormones and may play differential roles in the etiology
of health outcomes. Moreover, no studies have investigated whether the pandemic exacerbated pre-existing
racial/ethnic or neighborhood-level disparities in pubertal timing. To fill gaps in current knowledge, this study will
leverage electronic health records from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to conduct the first
population-based study on the pandemic and pubertal timing in the US. KPNC comprises ~32% of the northern
California population and has 4.4 million members. In 2010, KPNC began systematically documenting routine
pubertal development assessments for all children aged 6 years and older, thereby facilitating the study of trends
in both CPP incidence and normative pubertal timing in a population with considerable racial/ethnic,
socioeconomic, and geographic diversity. First, we will estimate pre–post pandemic changes in incident CPP
diagnoses at KPNC medical centers using an interrupted time series design, using data from 2017–2023 (Aim
1). Second, we will use survival analysis techniques to estimate pre–post pandemic changes in the timing of
normative pubertal milestones (including onset of pubic hair development, breast/testes development, and
menses) in a representative population cohort of approximately 103,000 boys and 72,000 girls (Aim 2). Finally,
we will examine the differential impact of the pandemic on CPP and normative pubertal timing across diverse
racial/ethnic groups and neighborhood conditions (Aim 3). Study strengths and innovations include the use of a
robust quasi-experimental design, longitudinal assessment of a large and representative population of boys and
girls, and investigation of several important hallmarks of puberty. Examination of racial/ethnic and place-based
disparities will guide the design of upstream health equity interventions and inform both clinical practice and
future pandemic response. This study also provides a foundation for future research to determine whether earlier
puberty has lasting health consequences for today’s children as they transition to adulthood."

applicant diverse expertise in these fields. The sponsor's laboratory excels in modeling immune responses in
relation to biophysical features of target cells, and the institutional strengths in immunology, mechanobiology,
and cell biology create an exceptional training environment conducive to success.
Metastasis occurs in a variety of organs with varying mechanical states. In recent years, the biophysical
properties of these microenvironments have emerged as an influencer of metastatic site preference (MSP) via
mutual biomechanical crosstalk where cancer cells mimic the stiffness of their environments’, otherwise known
as mechanoreciprocity. Our preliminary data has shown that cytotoxic lymphocytes, comprising of cytotoxic T
cells and natural killer cells, selectively destroy stiffer cancer cells during metastatic dissemination, a process
that we call mechanosurveillance. Our study combines biophysical measurements with in vivo models,
demonstrating that microenvironmental stiffness influences immune vulnerability, impacting the organ
distribution of metastatic outgrowth. In-depth analyses of metastatic cells from different organ sites, utilizing
atomic force microscopy and single-cell RNA sequencing, indicate that microenvironmental stiffness shapes
immune discrimination. Specifically, bone metastases exhibit increased stiffness, with the gene Spp1 playing a
role in maintaining this stiffness. Further studies using CRISPR-based knockout systems show that loss of
Spp1 softens cancer cells. This suggests mechanosurveillance targets stiff organ metastases, forming a
biophysical basis for metastatic site preference. Building on these preliminary observations we propose that
microenvironmental stiffness dictates the efficacy of mechanosurveillance and that this relationship shapes
both metastatic site preference and the power of anti-tumor immunotherapy. We will investigate this hypothesis
in two specific aims. Aim 1 employs in vivo mouse models to examine how distinct microenvironments affect
cancer cell mechanics, transcriptomics, and immune vulnerability. Specific genes, including Spp1, will be
manipulated to explore their role in mechanosurveillance. Aim 2 utilizes synthetic cancer cell niches to
investigate if environmental stiffness independently controls mechanosurveillance efficiency. The successful
completion of these aims could identify biomarkers guiding antitumor immunotherapy and inform novel
strategies for treating metastatic growth, advancing knowledge to enhance human health."

In this R13 application, we are requesting support for the European Behavioral Pharmacology Society (EBPS)
2024 workshop, “Novel Pharmacotherapies for Substance Use Disorders: From Basic Science to Societal
Implications”, taking place September 25-27, 2024 in Banff, Alberta, Canada. The goal of this 3-day event is to
bring together international experts in basic and clinical science who focus on novel pharmacology-based
interventions within the domain of substance use disorders (SUDs). We will pursue the following four specific
aims at the meeting: 1) create an international forum for leading basic and clinical SUD researchers to discuss
cutting edge pharmacology-based SUD interventions; 2) facilitate discussion of factors “outside the lab” that
can impact the implementation and/or efficacy of these interventions in the real world; 3) promote interaction
among diverse groups of investigators to stimulate exchange of ideas that will define the future directions of
SUD research; 4) to foster the development of the next generation of SUD researchers by encouraging the
participation of students, postdoctoral fellows, and new investigators committed to SUD research.
The scope of the keynote and symposia will be confined to basic and clinical studies involving pharmacology-
based interventions that show promise in the treatment of SUDs, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, and
neuropeptides. The content of these will range from cellular and molecular mechanisms to preliminary clinical
efficacy, in an effort to highlight the value of translational science. The meeting will also include panels on
“outside the lab” factors that may impact the effective implementation of these interventions, consisting of
experts in public policy, regulatory frameworks, medical journalism, and clinical ethics. Further interactions will
take form of Data Blitz and Hot Topics sessions, poster sessions, and ample discussion time.
This conference setup differs from that of many others in the field and will provide a unique opportunity for
close interactions among investigators at all stages of their careers. We chose an inclusive venue that hosts
conference space, accommodations, and dining options to provide abundant opportunity for networking. We
have aimed for a diverse lineup of invited speakers and will strive to promote meeting access (i.e., via travel
awards and waived registration) to individuals from historically marginalized populations. We believe that this
meeting will drive advances in novel pharmacotherapeutics for SUD treatments at a critical time in regards to
the need of novel SUD treatment options on the backdrop of changes in regulatory access to many of these
compounds."

The 2024 Annual Meeting of the Pan-American Society for Pigment Cell Research (PASPCR), entitled, “Where
pigment cell research never sleeps” will be held in New York City, September 9-12, 2024. Founded in 1988
and made up of approximately 100 members, the PASPCR unites clinicians, developmental biologists,
biochemists, immunologists, cell biologists, photobiologists and chemists in the study of pigmentation, melanin
and melanocytes. The overall objective of PASPCR 2024 is to increase our knowledge of the normal and
abnormal chemistry, biology, and photobiology of the melanocyte across species and its contribution to human
health and disease. Building on the success of partnering with other melanocyte focused societies at our last
meeting, we are planning a patient session sponsored by the Skin of Color Society (SOCS), the Global Vitiligo
Foundation (GVF), and the Global Albinism Alliance (GAA) focused on patients with skin of color and the
impact of melanocyte disease. The goals of the meeting are to (1) highlight recent advances in melanin
structure and analysis across species, in pigment cell response to light and other environmental stimuli, and in
genome-level understanding of melanocyte function and transformation using relevant animal models and
human tissues, (2) bring together investigators and clinicians with strong interests in photoprotection,
melanocyte developmental and stem cell biology and health disparities in pigmentary disease, and (3) provide
mentorship to young investigators with a specific focus on identifying and overcoming career barriers
encountered by women and underrepresented minorities. We have emphasized the importance of diversity,
equity, and inclusivity (DEI) with a dedicated educational session and patient session, by inviting faculty from
the SOCS to our meeting. In response to requests by trainees and young investigators, we are incorporating a
panel discussion focused on pigment cell research in the Industry setting. We have ensured meaningful
inclusion of young investigators, women, and underrepresented minorities among the invited speakers and
leadership of PASPCR 2024. The meeting also features a ""Mentorship Mixer"" that provides a structured
mechanism for students and trainees to obtain scientific and career guidance from well-established scientists.
Led by a strong organizational team, PASPCR 2024 promises to be a conference of lasting impact for the
pigment cell biology community."

Adolescence is an “age of risk” for the emergence of 1st onset of major depressive disorder (MD). Despite its
prevalence and public health significance, major unanswered questions exist regarding the mechanisms
involved in vulnerability to MD. Depression (Dep) is associated with a reduced sensitivity to rewards and low
reward-related brain function in cortico-striatal circuitry. However, research has not yet tested whether
chronically low reward responsivity (RR) or attenuated RR development during adolescence predicts 1st onset
of MD. A separate literature documents elevated peripheral inflammation in Dep. Yet, research also has not
examined whether chronically elevated inflammation or increases in inflammation during adolescence predicts
1st onset of MD. Further, research on inflammation and RR mostly has proceeded in parallel. Recently,
however, we and others have proposed neuroimmune network models of Dep. These models draw on work
indicating that peripheral inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) access the brain, where they lower RR.
When dysregulated, this immune-to-brain signaling can lead to chronic and worsening low RR, which is
reflected in dysphoria and anhedonia. This low RR is proposed to initiate unhealthy behaviors (substance use,
poor diet), as well as sleep disruption and stress generation, which further heighten inflammation. Over time,
dysregulation in RR and immune signaling may synergize in a positive feedback loop, whereby dysregulation
in each system exacerbates dysregulation in the other. We propose that reward-immune dysregulation is a
two-hit vulnerability for the 1st onset of MD and increases in Dep symptoms (Sxs) during adolescence.
Moreover, childhood and adolescent adversity and recent stressors influence both RR and inflammation, and
may set the foundation for reward-immune dysregulation. This proposal is the first systematic test of these
hypotheses. We will use an innovative biobehavioral high-risk design to examine bidirectional relationships
between peripheral inflammation and multiple indices and domains (monetary, social) of RR and their joint
prediction of 1st onset of MD and increases in Dep Sxs, particularly anhedonia. Three hundred 14-15 year old
participants (Ps) will complete a prospective 3-year longitudinal study. Ps with no prior MD will be selected
along the entire dimension of self-reported RR, with oversampling at the low tail of the dimension in order to
increase the likelihood of MD onsets. At Time 1 (T1), T3, and T5, each a year apart, Ps will complete blood
draws to quantify inflammation, self-report and behavioral measures of RR, and fMRI scans of reward neural
activity and functional connectivity. At T1-T5 (with T2 and T4 6 mo. between the yearly sessions), Ps also will
complete diagnostic interviews, and measures of Dep Sxs, reward-relevant life events, and behaviors that
increase inflammation. Adversity history will be assessed at T1 only. This proposal is an innovative integration
of research on reward and inflammatory signaling in understanding 1st onset of MD in adolescence. It has the
potential to facilitate novel neuroimmune and behavioral interventions to treat, and ideally prevent, MD."

This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on
advancing the field of microbiome in non-healing filarial lymphedema wounds in Ghana.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF), often referred to as 'hidden hunger,' is one such condition that
demands our immediate attention and unwavering commitment. In the shadows of global
health priorities, LF has quietly spread its roots across 72 countries, ensnaring over 120 million
lives, primarily in regions where healthcare resources are scarce. This is even more dire
among individuals with late-stage presentations such as lymphedema. Focused on addressing
the challenges posed by empirical treatment approach in managing infection-related LF
complications such as chronic non-healing filarial wounds, increasing prevalence of antibiotic-
resistant strains, we seek to pursue molecular-focused research with the opportunities that
this comprehensive career development program provides. Leveraging advanced
technologies and the QIIME 2 platform, the project seeks to identify unique microbial
signatures in lymphedema wounds and resistance patterns, contributing to improved
healthcare outcomes in LMICs. This is aimed at understanding the dynamics of bacterial and
fungal communities, exploring the interrelationship between the microbial profiles and the
clinical outcomes, establishing a LF-specific genomic library, and developing predictive
algorithms for monitoring wound healing progression in LF patients. Understanding for
instance, the microbial dynamics of LF-related infective complications will challenge the
current research and clinical practice paradigms as it will pave the way for more definitive
healthcare strategies that will mark a significant departure from empirical treatments, offering
the advantage of evidence-based, targeted interventions. This project will help generate
substantial dataset that will guide the development of relevant policies and guidelines that will
encourage the policy implementation such as antibiotic stewardship practices and evidence-
based management thereby optimizing patient outcomes. Again, as part of the approaches
toward achieving the program's goals, this career development research project also focuses
on enhancing leadership skills, strengthening research capacity through mentorship, and
collaboration to drive impactful research outcomes and contribute to the improvement of
healthcare practices among filarial lymphedema patients in LMICs."
